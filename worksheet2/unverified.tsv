A significant conributor to the meme that humans are a significant factor in global warming are the predictions of unverified climate models. Most of the media and psuedo scientists don't mention these sticky little details. Currently, these models all predict certain relationships between surface and tropospheric temperatures that are not validated by the observed data...even after the much publicized corrections to the data. I find it amusing that this guy uses global warming as an example of right wing preconceptualism when it is much more likely that it is an example of left wing preconceptualism.	2005-09-21

It consists of a few pages (&lt;10) per alleged conspiracy, most of which is vague, unverified, unfulfilling and, at best, slightly informative. Each section is a repackaging of prior speculations, which the authors do not investigate, and to which they add little insight.  <br /> <br />Some of it is outright discredited (e.g., the fictional invisible ship!) and some of it is outdated (e.g., the latest Roswell declassifications are not mentioned). <br /> <br />The authors method is to merely repeat others' comments regardless of whether they are reliable, and pass them off without chalenge. Hence, the book does not impart much real knowledge to the reader, even though it seems like it was meant to. <br /> <br />Also, there was little citation, and most of it is old. Looks like the authors did not update the 70 or 60 that were in the original. shoddy!	2005-09-02

Don't waste your money nor your time on this work.  If you want to read a real history of the life and times of Papa Pacelli, read Rabbi David G. Dalin's [[ASIN:0895260344 The Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII And His Secret War Against Nazi Germany]], written not by a failed Catholic, but by an observant Jew who became indignant at the soiling of Pope Pius XII's name, and who set out to set the record straight.    Consider the following before you dump your money into this travesty:    *A major response to Hitler's Pope came from University of Mississippi law professor Ronald J. Rychlak in his 2000 book on the subject, Hitler, the War, and the Pope. Rychlak was acknowledged by the Vatican to have been given special access to their closed archives for his research.[citation needed]    *Rychlak disagreed with Cornwell's claim of having found a \\"time bomb letter\\", arguing that the letter in question had actually been written not by Pacelli but by his assistant, and moreover had been fully published and discussed in a 1992 book by Emma Fattorini (a highly respected docent at the University of Rome).[18] With respect to Cornwell's allegations of antisemitism, Rychlak stated that \\"When Pius XII died in 1958, there were tributes from virtually every Jewish group around the world\\".    *Rychlak also alleged that Cornwell manipulated the photograph on the front cover of the American edition of the book, and incorrectly dated the photo as having been taken in March 1939, the month that Pacelli was made Pope. Rychlak charged that this had been deliberately in order to give the impression that Pius had just visited Hitler when, in fact, the photo had been taken in 1927 as Pius was leaving a reception held for German President Paul von Hindenburg.[21] Robert Royal has also repeated this allegation.    *In his 2005 book The Myth of Hitler's Pope, the historian and rabbi David G. Dalin countered Cornwell.[23] Dalin suggested that Yad Vashem should honor Pope Pius XII as a \\"Righteous Gentile,\\" concluding that \\"[t]he anti-papal polemics of ex-seminarians like Garry Wills and John Cornwell...of ex-priests like James Carroll, and or other lapsed or angry liberal Catholics exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today.\\" Dalin called the book's conclusions \\"unverified\\" and \\"strongly anti-religious\\".[25] Eugene Fisher, who has a PhD in Hebrew culture and education, said it was a \\"sad commentary on the secular media that this anti-Catholic screed was ever published\\".    *In the book The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, Philip Jenkins said that Hitler's Pope, along with anti-Catholic conspiracy theories and other \\"anti-Church historical polemic\\", belongs to the pseudohistory category of books about anti-Catholic \\"mythic history\\", historical manipulation, and national demonization, such as the Black Legend about Spain, said that publishers publish such books because the sell many copies, not because they mean to \\"destroy or calumniate Catholicism\\".    *Ken Woodward, writing in Newsweek, stated that Hitler's Pope has \\"errors of fact and ignorance of context [that] appear on almost every page.\\"    Source: [...] - Check the footnotes to read the primary sources.	2005-07-31

This'll save you money over the trade cloth one. <br />Should your county public library system allow you to RESERVE a <br />copy of either binding (soft/hard), then find out how to do so; <br />ask the professionally-trained Librarian (not the checkout clerk) <br />(print the Amazon page and take it with you to ease the process). <br />3. <br />Having encouraged you to get a copy of this timely book, I hasten <br />to call your attention to what has been said regarding the CAUSE <br />of the various forms of cancer throughout the 'civilized' world, <br />as stated by an avatar in India (1926-20XX), Sathya Sai Baba of <br />Puttaparthi (now at Prasanthi Nilayam, AP 515 134, India). Why a <br />westerner shopping on amazon.com should consider a living avatar <br />vis-a-vis the #1 cause of cancer? Because by having a divine view <br />of mundane matters (debatable premise, admittedly: sathyasai.org) <br />He can point out from His perspective aspects which we would not <br />consider to be important. In this case, it is the BONES that stay <br />within the refined sugar after the process of chemically removing <br />'impurities' from raw cane (or beet?) that are the number 1 cause <br />of cancer. He mentions that tobacco and poluution come a distant <br />second in being causative agents. The bone particles are present <br />even in so-called brown or turbinado sugar, which is white with <br />some molasses added back. He suggests the alternative JAGGERY to <br />sweeten meals without the refined sugars. There's one point which <br />He typically inserts as a test of backbone: one must decide if a <br />sweet tooth is more important than one's long-term health. I add <br />myself that we can exist without factory sugar (uncivilized folks <br />got along fine without it before white sugar became essential), & <br />sugar supposedly FEEDS cancer cells that seemingly exist (double <br />whammy), whereas OXYGEN supposedly kills cancer cells. Forgive me <br />for throwing in those last two unverified tidbits; nevertheless, <br />since they seem to directly affect cancer cells (feed/kill), and <br />since most folks CAN take control over how much sugar and oxygen <br />enters their system, it seems to me to be worthwhile to tell you. <br /> <br />I regret the say that I haven't the citation from Baba; he stated <br />the connection between cancer and (refined) sugar in 1981, and it <br />appeared in a (very difficult to find online!) 'Summer Showers'. <br />What astonishes me is that devotees of Sai Baba commonly KNOW of <br />this cause-and-effect, yet nothing is being done to spread word.	2005-07-23

Dawn goes into how we got into the current cultural mess in our society, though given the book's age it is a bit dated as it refers primarily to \\"Boomers\\" (from what I've gathered in other research, the situation is similar for GenX, just worse).  She then critiques the well meaning (I hope) attempts to reach America's dumbed down, short attention span, commitment phobic generation with worship styles that would be attractive to them, no matter the cost to the Gospel.    Dawn critiques not only contemporary worship but traditionalISM as well. She sees the function of worship (quite correctly, I might add) not as means of attracting numbers (AKA \\"worship evangelism\\"), but of having a personal experience with part of God, forming the character of the worshiper, and building community. Both extremes are the antithesis of this.    I have two minor criticisms of this book. Dawn, who I guess has no training in science or technology, tends to present as scientific fact the results of single research studies which appear to be unverified by independent work (to be fair, some are unlikely to be reproduced anytime soon) and might not have had significant peer review. Second she, unlike Long, is a little vague when it comes to solutions, though they seem to be there somewhere. In other words, she can ramble a bit.	2005-07-16

Looking at the comic book cover, the sensationalistic back jacket, and cover to cover of unverified accusations, this book was tailor-made for conspiracy buffs. For example, they want you to believe that 15 years ago microchips were being injected into the bloodstream to reach the brain for the purpose of mind control. Never mind that 15 years ago wafer fabs capable of manufacturing such chips don't, and still do not, exist - oh, that's right, the government is covering them up! <br /> <br />This book has examples of criminals who, when arrested, claimed that the government was injecting voices in their heads. What the author seems to have left out is that claiming to hear voices is the first step in a defendant's PRETENSE of an insanity defense! Yeah, this author leaves a lot out. <br /> <br />But never mind, the facts make no difference to conspiricy fanatics, do they? <br /> <br />Stay away from this book unless you like it piled high and really smelly. <br />	2005-06-18

I started it preparing myself for a hatchet job, but found, slightly to my disappointment, much that was well-balanced and reasonable. <br />The first chapters contained unverified statements about child psychology.such as \\"overprotected kids do not flourish.\\" I'll leave the dodgeball issue to NASPE members. <br />The accounts of Maslow and Carl Rogers and the encounter therapies of the sixties flog some dead horses (Maslow died in 1970 and Carl Rogers in1987). <br />Chapter 3, from Sin to Syndrome, hits some easy targets in examples of psychiatric defenses in criminal cases, but is rather superficial. I'd agree with what they say about the management of pedophiles. I think they shortchange the possibility of abnormal brain chemistry leading to addiction, but they talk excellent sense about the brain imaging studies.  <br />Chapter four contains a useful summary of what is know about the course and therapy of bereavement.  I'd recommend it to any student who doesn't have time to read Zisook  (\\"Biopsychosocial Aspects of Bereavement\\") or Parkes.  The discussion of PTSD and its treatment is well informed and helpful. The evidence about support groups for medical illnesses is dealt with fairly. Perhaps it's an unfair shot but, after looking at the jacket photographs, one rather wonders about the authors' credentials for pontificating about combat veterans.  <br /> Chapter five deals with the emergency psychotherapeutic response to disaster in scathing and nihilistic terms that are probably well justified but become repetitious after having made the well-worn observation that the usefulness of debriefing is questionable. <br />I didn't find it highly readable.  Maybe that's because it's not polemical and biased enough. It's largely made up of summaries of other people's writings and some of the best bits are quotations from others, such as the man offered bereavement counseling after the death of his 105 year old aunt. <br />	2005-05-06

If you're sick of people who just post partisan attacks or commentaries withouth actually mentioning anything relating to the book (which is 80% of the reviews for this book) then read on.  <br /> <br />After reading several of Ted Rall's columns and seeing him on tv, there was not one thing that he said that I had agreed with. However, after reading this book, he is suprisingly rational on some issues including immigration and  <br /> <br />abortion.  Overall, this book was a lot more interesting and thought-provoking than most of the usual liberal tripe by people like Al Franken, David Corn, or David Brock.  THe main reason is because it actually talks about what Rall  <br /> <br />thinks should be done (regardless of how crazy some of the ideas are) and only spends 1 chapter complaining about Republicans and how they're evil, etc.  The usual best selling political book from liberals these days is all about Bush/ <br />Republicans and lying, etc.  Rall has finally figured out that people are sick of these attack books and might rather instead hear what liberals stand for.   <br /> <br />So here goes. Rall's writing is very easy to follow although his tone is a bit crude at times.  The only problem I had is that he doesn't use footnotes or sources in the text.  All the sources are listed by topic at the end leaving you to go  <br />hunting for the validity of any claims made in the book.  There are several chapters which are repeats of each other but I guess some people never get tired of the term \\"neo-fascists\\".  Just like any liberal book, completely unverified conspiracy theories are mentioned (Bush had his underage girlfriend  <br />get an abortion in 1971 when it was still illegal,  Bush officials invaded Afghanistan because of the oil and gas pipeline, Al Gore actually won Florida by 46,000 votes), so don't fret if you're a kool-aid drinker.  Overall, he does  <br />manage to stay pretty close to ideas and issues instead of personal attacks though.   <br /> <br />Some of the things which Rall has suggested that I agreed with included \\"Education cirriculum should be nationalized\\", \\"affirmative action is  <br />indistinguishable from quotas\\" and that affirmative action should be eliminated or based on class (not race),  \\"from a biological standpoint, abortion is the killing of an unborn baby\\" (we differ here in that I think this killing is not  <br />justifiable whereas Rall believes it is), \\"Americans seeking to cast votes should answer a few simple questions\\", and \\"The US should admit more legal and fewer illegal immigrants\\".  I agree totally with all these ideas.  What is suprising is that they are all in stark contrast to basic Democratic/liberal  <br />principles.   <br /> <br />Now there are plenty of things which Rall says that are completely crazy.  He of course wants major economic changes all moving us more towards socialism (\\"wealthy individuals and businesses should be taxed nearly to death\\").  Also he  <br />says Judges should decide punishments instead of mandatory sentencing laws (the whole reason of which was to take out the subjectivity of sentences between judges), we need to convince other countries that hate us not to hate us, the environment is the most important priority, and that Democrats need to be  <br />completely ruthless and shameless in fighting the Republicans.  This is one of the main themes  of the book on which I think Rall is completely wrong.  He says that Republicans win because they are underhanded and they fight so much harder and dishonestly than Democrats.  I believe that the reason people aren't voting for Democrats (and most of the ideas he suggests) is because the majority of the people in this country don't agree with them (esp the ones I mentioned above).   <br /> <br />If you're looking for something that is interesting and not the same \\"Bush lied, Bush sucks, Republicans are mean, evil, Nazi's\\" liberal book go read this book.  Regardless of whether you agree or disagree withRall at least he has the intelligence to put forth ideas and try to explain them and why they will work/win.	2005-03-05
US	50697552	RFXIBHDE8ZMQI	0140143599	693084256	Cantor's Dilemma: A Novel	Books	2	5	10	N	N	a over simplification of reality	This little book (Cantor's dilemma) came to my attention ironically not because of its well celebrated English version, but because of the new Chinese translation, which bore a new name (The prisoner of the Nobel Prize). Anyway, I spent a whole evening enthusiastically (at the beginning) perusing it (the English version), but was left with more or less joy. <br />Many people in Amazon.com have praised this little book presumably without any reservation. I would also first congratulate the author's great effort to write a novel on scientific ethics, and in particular for the psychoanalysis of scientists. However, in terms of literature and science, I would say this book is not worth much attentions. <br />The plot in this novel is too simple. A serious professor had a brilliant idea (which is flawed based on biology, by the way), two worked experiments (probably), and the Nobel prize, but suffered by unverified experiments due to suspicious manipulations of his postdoc. It surprised me that he won the prize within a year. This oversimplified the reality. If the professor didn't publish his experiment details and furthermore the experiments couldn't be replicated in other labs (officially), it is impossible to get the Nobel prize, let alone within a year. It would be better that the professor didn't get the Nobel prize and was constantly suffered from unverified experiments, rumors of data fabrication, and science politics. The deft handling of these crisis is more interesting for future academic seekers.  <br />One of the key components in this book is about research ethics. We have heard many rumors about research ethics. This book talked about a similar situation occurred in the Noble Laurel David Baltimore's lab, in which a postdoc was involved some manipulations of data. I like the author's way of presentation: hinted but never gave a definite answer whether the postdoc did something wrong with the experiment or not.  <br />In terms of science ethics, I would like recommend people reviewing one of the most horrible studies in modern history: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. This study was initiated by the United States Public Health Service, together with the Tuskegee Institute in 1932. The study recruited 399 black men diagnosed with syphilis in Macon County, Alabama to determine the effects of untreated syphilis. The study would last until 1970, way after the discovery of penicillin in 1943, which is the most effective drug to treat syphilis. Unfortunately, these black men, with the highest education at 7th grade, were only treated by aspirin and an iron supplement. It was till mass media caught this horror that halted this experiments. By then, many had died of complications of syphilis.  <br />Although the book spent quite some length talking about trust, responsibility, authorship , lab rules, and in particular the peer pressure and jealousy, advisor seeking, tenure system, and gender discrimination, the author barely scratched the surface of publishing process, grant application and management, and other important research activities. It is possible that the author thought his intended readers are most likely undergraduates or beginning graduates. However, beginning graduates are eager to know how these research activities are like so that they can decide whether they want to seek academic jobs or not. Most time advisors are reluctant to talk about these issues with new graduate students. <br />The author also devoted some pages on sex, especially on teacher-student type of sex. I am not sure why he blended sex in this book but it did add some vintages in it. The depicting of female scholars in this novel is too optimistic. That a fresh female chemistry PhD can get an assistant professorship in Harvard, Cal tech, and Wisconsin is amazing, if not shocking.  <br />In terms of writing skills, the author seemed to have adopted a film making style. However, sometimes background events cut into flow of story too abruptly.Furthermore, the author lacked the ability to write juicy words when he was describing romantic events. His view of sex and romance was also old fashioned. <br />I think the ending is the worst part of this novel. As we all know, academic people are good at insinuating things. A famous professor will never write a blunt insulting letter to another professor. I guess the author tried to give solutions to all problems left in the novel instead of giving some hints. This reflects his lack of confidence to his readers, which are at least college students ( I doubt a not prepared high school student can understand many concepts discussed in his book). <br />In summary, if you don't know much about scientists, this book will give you a good kick start. If you are a graduate student who talk with your advisors very often, this book may be too simple to you. If you are a seasoned researcher, it is probably wiser to use your time on other amusements.	2005-01-12

Mr. Wolberg is the Senior Firearms Criminologist at the San Diego Police Department Crime Laboratory.<br /><br />  Rather than being the \\"Definitive Study\\" of handgun stopping power as the title self-proclaims, this confusing text provides the reader a schizophrenic mixture of material. The majority of this book is replete with contradictions, mistakes, and unsubstantiated speculation. There are so many gross errors and inconsistencies in the text that it is impossible to mention them all in this short review.<br /><br />  Neurogenic Shock<br /><br />  Dr. Mary Case, a board-certified neuropathologist and forensic pathologist with the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's Office and the St. Louis University School of Medicine, Dr. Michael Graham, a forensic pathologist with the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's Office and the St. Louis University School of Medicine, COL. Charles Van Way, a general surgeon with the U.S. Army 325th General Hospital, and Dr. Thomas Helling, the Director of Trauma Surgery at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, reviewed Chapter 2, \\"A Neurologist's View of `Stopping Power'\\". These well qualified scientists are unanimous in their condemnation of this material.<br /><br />  The absurd claims made in this chapter, as well as the similar remarks on pages 6, 7, and 176, regarding the ability of a bullet to remotely stress and shock the central nervous system (CNS) are grossly inaccurate and completely unsupported by any accepted scientific evidence according to Dr. Case. This pseudoscientific speculation is presented as verified scientific fact, yet allusion to G&ouml;ransson's discredited data is the only scientific reference the authors cite to support their unjustified claims.1 Dr. Helling remarks that this material: \\"...relates to anecdotal experience and pure hypothesis,\\" while Dr. Van Way states that it: \\"...would seem not only to be without supporting evidence, but to contradict common sense.\\"<br /><br />  A thorough review of the scientific literature relating to wound ballistics has failed to identify any valid research papers which demonstrate that projectiles can exert a remote effect on the CNS.<br /><br />  Street Results/One-Shot-Stop Percentages<br /><br />  Throughout the text, Marshall and Sanow offer \\"street results\\" which purport to show the \\"stopping power\\" and percentage of \\"one-shot stops\\" that particular handgun bullets have produced in actual shootings. On page 47 they write: \\"These street results are the heart and soul of this book on stopping power.\\" Accurate, documented field data of bullet performance in actual shootings is a crucial adjunct to laboratory test results; unfortunately, valid information is very difficult to acquire. Their \\"field data\\" appears to be based on anecdotal \\"war stories\\" which are incomplete and unverified, as illustrated by the example below.<br /><br />  On page 121, Marshall and Sanow state: \\"The following five Glaser shootings come from Gene Wolberg, Senior Criminologist, San Diego Police Crime Lab.\\" Mr. Wolberg, an author of this review, testified that only the third and fifth incidents described are fully documented and verifiable cases. Mr. Wolberg states he is only casually aware of the fourth incident and emphasizes that his second-hand information is undocumented. Mr. Wolberg denies all knowledge of the first two shooting reports Marshall and Sanow attribute to him. On pages 43 and 44, Marshall and Sanow discuss their data collection methodology:<br /><br />  \\"4. In order to be included in this study, I insisted on either having or at least being able to review some of the following: police reports, evidence technician reports, statements by the victim (if he survived), homicide reports, autopsy results, and photos. Whenever possible, I also talked to the emergency room doctorsand attending physicians.<br /><br />  5. Recovered bullets were either personally examined or photographed by me, or I was provided with photographs of the bullets.\\"<br /><br />  Mr. Wolberg never provided Marshall or Sanow any of the reports, test results, photos or evidence which they insist the inspect prior to including a shooting in their data base. As a result, the veracity of their entire data base is questionable. The verisimilitude of the author's \\"street result\\" data is also in doubt since they violate basic principles of scientific research by not publishing their original data and by claiming \\"secrecy\\" when asked to identify their source documentation so that independent researchers who investigate wound ballistics could inspect their original information and verify their results.<br /><br />  Additionally, Marshall's and Sanow's \\"street results\\" and \\"one-shot stop\\" statistics fail to address what anatomic structures are disrupted and damaged by the bullet. They also ignore the crucial fact that many adversaries are incapacitated due to psychological rather than physiological reasons: they decide to stop, but are not forced to stop. While the degree and rapidity of any physiological incapacitation produced by a given bullet is predictable based on what anatomic structures the bullet disrupts and the severity of the tissue damage, psychological incapacitation is an extremely erratic, highly variable, and completely unpredictable individual human response which is independent of any inherent characteristics of the bullet. An eloquent critique analyzing the flaws of these \\"street results\\" and \\"one-shot stop\\" statistics is presented by Patrick.2<br /><br />  A typical example of the contradictions in this book is the following quotation from page 161, which indicates the authors are fully aware of the meaningless nature of these irrelevant and misleading \\"street results\\" and \\"one-shot stop\\" statistics:<br /><br />  \\"To make matters worse, all shooting results are anomalies, or single cases, unique to themselves. The data is strictly anecdotal. As such they blatantly defy direct comparison to one another. Each case is filled with variables almost beyond number. Some of these variables are real. Some are only perceived.<br /><br />  The real fact-based variables include, but are not limited to, the victim's state of mind, the presence of alcohol or other behavior-modifying chemicals such as PCP, and the physical size and stamina of the victim. Other variables include the barrel length and bullet impact velocity, the generation and condition of ammo used, and the presence of obstacles that the bullet passed through to reach the intended target.<br /><br />  The largest variable in any gunfight is the exact path the bullet takes from entry until exit and the exact tissue the bullet engages. Two bullet paths can be identical from entry to exit. If one happens to nick something like a major artery or chip a bone in the spine, the results can be wildly different, even if the rest of the scenario is identical.\\", and photos.

An eloquent critique analyzing the flaws of these \\"street results\\" and \\"one-shot stop\\" statistics is presented by Patrick.2 <br /> <br />        A typical example of the contradictions in this book is the following quotation from page 161, which indicates the authors are fully aware of the meaningless nature of these irrelevant and misleading \\"street results\\" and \\"one-shot stop\\" statistics: <br /> <br />            \\"To make matters worse, all shooting results are anomalies, or single cases, unique to themselves. The data is strictly anecdotal. As such they blatantly defy direct comparison to one another. Each case is filled with variables almost beyond number. Some of these variables are real. Some are only perceived. <br /> <br />            The real fact-based variables include, but are not limited to, the victim's state of mind, the presence of alcohol or other behavior-modifying chemicals such as PCP, and the physical size and stamina of the victim. Other variables include the barrel length and bullet impact velocity, the generation and condition of ammo used, and the presence of obstacles that the bullet passed through to reach the intended target. <br /> <br />            The largest variable in any gunfight is the exact path the bullet takes from entry until exit and the exact tissue the bullet engages. Two bullet paths can be identical from entry to exit. If one happens to nick something like a major artery or chip a bone in the spine, the results can be wildly different, even if the rest of the scenario is identical.\\"	2005-01-06

Too many celebrity biographies, sadly, are little more than tabloids, reporting every bit of gossip as undisputed fact, even if there's zero evidence, repeating the same old unverified or exaggerated anecdotes, and giving credence to misinformation provided by questionable sources, many of whom have some sort of agenda.  Ms. Leider's book is nothing like the type of sleaze churned out by people such as Geoffrey Giuliano and the late Albert Goldman.  It's easy to fall into a trap of writing a sensationalised account when you're dealing with a star about whom there's been so much misinformation, gossip, and outright slander for so many decades, but she rises above that and reports only the truth (though of course people who have long cherished and believed in said gossip aren't going to be too happy their longtime fantasies are discredited).<br /><br />There were a couple of tidbits in this book I found to be a little too much information, but even those things were presented in a tasteful and respectful way, not just put in there to be to shocking or sensational.  There were also a lot of great pictures, and a LOT of sources listed in the back to go to for additional information (books, magazine articles, websites, etc.).  Having heard that this book was very positively and heartily endorsed at the annual memorial service on Valentino's Jarhzeit (death anniversary), I was sold on reading it.  And since this book has been written, happily, 'Beyond the Rocks' is no longer a lost film as it's reported in these pages.  It's the perfect combination of scholarly research, lively storytelling, and genuine respect and love for the biographer's subject.t.	2005-01-06

Lewis is riddled with groundless guesswork in place of innovative research or thoughtful interpretation. In describing Lewis's early life,for example, he refers to Lewis's \\"overactive imagination,\\" and comments that Lewis listened to \\"pointless, meaningless\\" sermons when he was taken to church as a boy. On what, exactly, does he base such conclusions?  These are the sorts of unverified, opinionated comments that even a freshman English student would be expected to avoid in his research, and they are peppered throughout the book. Further, the prose itself is colorless.  One wonders at the sheer lack of vocabulary.  The book offers nothing that might flesh out the intellectual context of Lewis's best known works. This biography is a waste of time.	2004-12-28
US	38044383	R3BU3V60J0KRSV	0878559647	603664167	The Claim of Dispossession	Books	5	57	64	N	N	Very informative	Excellent work of dispassionate scholarship <br /> <br />Highly informative. The author meticulously  documents Palestinian demographic trends, Jewish efforts to purchase lands, and the effect of these efforts on Arab peasants. Its only drawback is that its dispassionate non-polemical style at times makes for dry reading   <br /> <br />A previous reviewer (\\"ramacat\\") claimed to have read this work, but then claims he could not \\"confirm\\" some of the source material, and that supporting evidence was \\"bogus\\" , \\"misquoted\\", \\"misreported\\" , \\"unverified racist ramblings\\", and finally  \\"often just patently stupid\\". These comments seem odd and it is clear this person never even gazed upon this book. <br />  <br />The author relies primarily on three types of sources. His demographic analysis relies on the work of a highly respected geographic demographer and academic; Prof. Roberto Bachi , as well as on British censuses conducted during the British mandate. The works of Pof. Bachi as well as British census data are both readily available at the research libraries in most major cities (they were at least at the 42nd st. research library at NYC). Thus for example he provides British census data to demonstrate Arab migration to Jewish settled areas by noting the dramatic increases in Arab populations in cities with a substantial Jewish populations or adjacent to rural Jewish settlements (i.e. Jerusalem, Haifa, Jaffa ect.) and the much more modest population increases (and at times decreases) in the Arab population of purely Arab cities or areas (i.e. Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah ect.). <br /> <br />In documenting Jewish land purchases he relies on archival records of the Jewish Agency. As these sources are in Hebrew and are located in Israeli archives, I doubt that the reviewer mentioned above attempted to \\"confirm\\" them seeing as he is writing from Thailand. <br /> <br />Finally the author relies on the reports of various British commissions and surveys  (i.e. Peel, Hope Simpson,Lewis French) to evaluate the effects of Jewish purchases on Arab peasants. Thus for instance he relates that in 1931, Lewis French conducted a survey of landlessness and eventually offered new plots to any Arabs who had been \\"dispossessed.\\" British officials received more than 3,000 applications, of which 80 percent were ruled invalid by the Government's legal adviser because the applicants were not landless Arabs. This left only about 600 landless Arabs, 100 of whom accepted the Government land offer. The Lewis French survey along with the Hope Simpson and Peel commision reports are readilly available at most research libraries, including the one in NYC mentioned above. <br /> <br />This books detractor \\"concludes\\" that all positive reviews come from \\"true believers\\". I think it is clear who the \\"true believer\\" is. <br /> <br />	2004-11-16

Variously termed the Fourth Global War (the Third being the Cold War), the U.S.-Jihadist War, the U.S.-Al Qaeda War, or the U.S.-Islamist War, the very fact that three years into it that there is no agreed upon name is indicative of the ambiguous and divisive nature of the conflict.<br /><br /> Friedman traces the origins of Al Qaeda to the mujahideen of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, a force trained and supplied by the U.S., recruited and financed by Saudi Arabia (with Pakistan playing a vital role as well), a program initiated by the Carter administration and expanded by Reagan. While not condemning the operation, as Friedman believes that the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan was a key element in beating them in the Cold War, the operation did sow the seeds of Al Qaeda. These mujahideen were educated, battle-hardened, and very ideological - and not at all wanted back by their home governments (chiefly Saudi Arabia). Abandoned also by the Americans, incensed by the presence of Christian nations on holy Saudi soil during the first Gulf War, and increasingly intolerant of corrupt, American-supported regimes in the Islamic world, they sought to attack the U.S. chiefly because they wished to wound the country in such a way as to force it into intervening massively in the Islamic world. Such an intervention - preferably an invasion - would Al Qaeda hoped provoke a Muslim uprising, overthrowing regimes and ideally restoring the medieval Caliphate.<br /><br /> Friedman detailed the operational strengths and weaknesses of Al Qaeda. The original mujahideen were quite experienced with covert operations, largely from having worked side-by-side with the CIA, seeing first hand American covert operation tactics and technology. Al Qaeda expanded this knowledge by among other things continually testing U.S. intelligence in the 1990s, provokingthe system to see what responses were generated, checking for leaks in their organization, etc. Not only was this reflected in part by the African embassy bombings and the attack on the _U.S.S. Cole_ but also by the constant \\"chatter\\" that is heard worldwide (as an added bonus for Al Qaeda this chatter can also saturate the intelligence system, rendering it less sensitive to real threats).<br /><br /> The book details the entire strategic views of the United States, from pre-war to today. Friedman states that the U.S. was caught flat-footed by 9-11; not only was it tactically surprised, but it was strategically surprised (far greater than say Pearl Harbor, as the U.S. knew it was going to war with Japan). The U.S. early on in the war was forced to adapt Cold War plans the best it could to deal with the situation (such as protecting the President on 9-11 and waging war in Afghanistan) but continually had trouble grappling with fighting a global war against a non-state, elusive enemy, one that while heavily involved in Afghanistan was nonetheless not dependent upon on any one nation.<br /><br /> The war against Al Qaeda produced many problems for the administration. There is still a debate on whether to treat at least in some quarters the conflict against Al Qaeda as a law enforcement or a military issue. The FBI, one of the many agencies tasked to find Al Qaeda in the U.S. is primarily a law enforcement agency, not an intelligence agency, and by its very nature is often poorly suited to uncovering cells in the U.S. American intelligence has in the past few decades since the Bay of Pigs been obsessed with verifiable intelligence, everything needing a verified, documented source, rated arbitrarily he says on a scale of 1 to 5. If it does not, it might not make it into a final report or if it does it is severely downplayed.  Assumptions, unverified reports, and leaps of logic might not make it into final reports, perhaps written and filed away - which along with isolated bits of information \\"prove\\" to critics that the government \\"knew\\" something - but may in the end have no influence on decision makers.<br /><br />  Friedman states that the U.S. has two overall strategic goals in the war. First, it is to deny any possibility that weapons of mass destruction would fall into Al Qaeda's hands. The early days of the war saw Washington in a panic about this, particularly concerned with the status of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Second, the U.S. seeks to change the behavior of countries that for domestic reasons might support Al-Qaeda or otherwise be disinclined to work against them.<br /><br /> A large portion of the book is spent on the war in Iraq. Friedman maintains that the primary though unstated reasons were twofold; to end the perception that it was militarily weak and that Al Qaeda was going to prevail in the long run (in particular the U.S. was concerned with Saudi perception), and to provide a strategic base to fight Al Qaeda everywhere in the region; other concerns, though real, were secondary. Though the U.S. has achieved some strategic success in the war, the Iraq war showed many key intelligence failures; that Ahmed Chalabi (chief U.S. candidate for the Iraqi presidency) was an Iranian agent who fed the U.S. disinformation, the U.S. was unaware that the Shiites in Iraq had long ago been organized by Iranian intelligence after Desert Storm, and that Saddam Hussein from the very beginning had intended to fight a guerrilla war.<br /><br /> An interesting book, I liked how Friedman discussed not just military strategy but international politics, detailing  France's stance for instance on the Iraq conflict and American attempts to counter it as well as deals made with Iran and Russia in the fight against Al Qaeda, even Spanish politics following the Madrid bombings. The U.S got heavily involved in South Asian politics as part of the war on terror during the events after the December 13, 2001 attack on India's parliament, an event that might have resulted in another India-Pakistan war.	2004-10-17

It's hard to get full and you know you that you really shouldn't finish the whole dozen. But you do.  (The author uses an analogy with jellybeans, but I don't care for sugar in that density.)<br /><br />The author, Wendy Northcutt, recognized this pitfall, and even stated \\"These stories aren't meant to be read all at once.\\" But putting this collection of tales on the table top proves harder than expected. . .just one more, you think, then another, and well, you see how it goes.<br /><br />Ms. Northcutt prefaces this collection of tales-some true and verified; some unverified submissions; some personal accounts; and, for fun, some relevant urban legend-with a synopsis of Darwin's somehow still controversial \\"theory\\" of evolution (when will we collectively abandon the notion that evolution is a theory; how the Internet shaped her work in collecting and verifying submissions for the Darwin Awards; and the criteria for determining the winners of this dubious honor.<br /><br />Some may consider Ms. Northcutt's rather biting humor mean-spirited and cruel. Others find great humor at these mostly fatal tales marked chiefly by stupidity---those a measure of these doomed souls no doubt were ignorant of the potentially lethal consequences of their actions.<br /><br />Regardless, \\"The Darwin Awards\\" might find a home in a beach house, on a book case in the basement, or even a treehouse.

Few of these people show any record of previous reviews, or the ones they have submitted are mostly with a far left wing point of view.<br /><br />One might debate whether Kerry was a \\"hero\\" for one of his awards, (and it could be only one of them at the most) but no one can debate that Kerry is a self-admitted war criminal. It is obvious that Kerry was someone who knew the \\"three purples\\" and you are out policy and it pretty obvious from eye witness accounts that he did not deserve at least two of them since they were self-inflicted and did not occur under enemy fire. But to me the most important parts of the book are not the specifics of who shot (or didn't shoot) John. Most telling are the Senator's own words which have changed so many times over the years as to make him someone who could never be believed. His testimony in front of the Senate in 1971 is based upon unverified and undocumented accounts of so-called veterans, most of whom never wore a uniform. He denied still being a member of the VVAW when that group was advocating the assassination of Congressmen, and only changed his story when the FBI released their records this year. When he was given his draft notice, he asked for a deferment to be able to study French for a year, but was turned down. Rather than be drafted, he joined the US Navy Reserves, not the US Navy and was unlucky enough to be activated. (The navy reserves were the Navy equivalent of the Air National Guard that Bush is so derided for joining.) Instead of having two tours of Vietnam as he claimed, his first \\"tour\\" included 5 weeks in the Tonkin gulf, not even within sight of Vietnam on a large ship that spent most of his one year tour off the coasts of California and Australia. When Kerry volunteered for Swift Boat duty, it was the safest tour in the Navy since it was really a taxi from big ships to safe harbors. He vehemently objected to reporting for duty when the mission changed. His first purple heart was awarded mysteriously after the attending physician said he had seen worse scrapes from a rose bush and refused to recommend him for one. It is no wonder that Kerry has refused to release all of his records. Especially since Kerry was the one who fired his weapon too close to shore and his \\"wound\\" came from a tiny piece of shrapnel from his own weapon, and there was no hostile fire that night anywhere near his boat.<br /><br />But the book is not just about \\"he said, he said\\" versus his fellow vets. It is a story of someone who took his own movie camera and \\"reenacted\\" fights which never occurred so that he could be, as he said himself, the \\"Next JFK\\".<br /><br />It is the story of a very flawed man whose record in the Senate could be predicted by his actions in Vietnam. If you really want to put someone in office who has no moral compass, than you couldn't find anyone better than Kerry, with the possible exception of the draft dodger the Democrats nominated when Kerry said Vietnam service shouldn't be a consideration for electing someone as President. But of course the imperious senator would brook no dissent from those opposed to him, as we see in his attack on the first amendment rights of his fellow Vietnam vets who happen to disagree with him about his qualifications for service as president. As Senator Edwards requested, the American people are spending \\"three minutes\\" with Kerry's fellow vets to find out what kind of man he is. Kerry's problem is that the \\"conversation\\" isn't limited to just the five he wanted us to hear from, we are hearing it from the hundreds who served on his boat, or within 50 feet of him, and saw him in action during his short four months in Vietnam before he finished manipulating the systemand ran for cover just as soon as he could. Now that those brave men who stayed for their full tour of duty (including many who could have left after they got their purple hearts) are speaking up, they are attacked by the same people who found no problem with multibillionaires funding their \\"527\\" sleaze machines against President Bush.ver just as soon as he could.

If so, I would encourage you to read this book. <br /> <br />The book opens with the fallacy of \\"the best college\\" that college rankings tend to foster. To produce a ranking, each college is reduced to a single number. But can an experience as complex as college really be expressed as a single number? The book discusses problems with producing the ranking such as unverified data, sensitivity to minor changes in data values, selection of criteria to measure, and getting input from college presidents but not students. <br /> <br />The book then continues by discussing the elements of a quality education: <br />1. A commitment to general education throughout all four years of college. <br />2. A commitment to writing, speaking, and critical-thinking skills for all students in every class. <br />3. A commitment to active learning (including interactions between the faculty and students beyond the classroom). <br />4. Opportunities for learning beyond the classroom (such as education abroad and internships). <br />5. A diverse, intellectually active, and respectful community. <br /> <br />Please note what this book is not: it is not a complete guide to  choosing a college. For example, it does not discuss cost, location, setting (urban, suburban, etc.), or distance from home. Also, the book deemphasizes the choice of a major more than I feel is appropriate. For example, if your child wants to go into engineering, choosing a small liberal arts college would probably be a poor choice. <br /> <br />In summary, I highly recommend this book for three types of people: <br />1. If you and your child are choosing colleges based on their ranking and reputation, this book should help you understand the fallacy of college rankings. <br />2. If you and your child are in the process of selecting a college, this book discusses factors you will probably want to consider in making your decision. <br />3. If you and your child have selected a lower-ranked school, this book should help you deal with friends and relatives who still subscribe to the myth of \\"the best college.\\"	2004-08-24

But in this case, I wanted to warn the open-minded that this book is nothing like what the other reviewers claim it to be. <br /> <br />Where to begin?  After reading all these glowing reviews by other readers, I felt that here could truly be a new look into an otherwise well researched area.  WRONG.  After trying to confirm some of the source material cited, I gave up.  Much of the supporting alleged facts are bogus, misreported, misquoted, unverified racist ramblings, or often just patently stupid.  Just because some crack-pot has published something, doesn't mean it's true and you can authoritatively cite it as a source.  You don't like a fact, then make up your own and publish it yourself.  If you are willing to believe anything that suits your biased pre-formed belief, then this book is for you. However, if you have a brain larger than that of an average chipmunk, you will probably give up reading after a couple of chapters and figure that watching reruns of The Brady Bunch is a more intellectually profitable use of your time than finishing this book. <br /> <br />Sadly, I can not but conclude that the glowing reviews are written by other true believers that are trying to revise history by yelling loudly and often.  This book adds nothing to the debate or the history of the topic it purports to discuss.  It is pure propaganda. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time or money. <br />	2004-07-27

I had no reason to believe a biography would tell lies, esp. one that was allegedly as well-researched as Goldman claimed this one was.  Though Goldman's attempts to paint John and Yoko (as well as many other people in their lives) as these horrible horrible Satanic and psychologically messed up people failed; every negative trait of John's he gleefully wrote about, every shocking story, disgusting anecdote, vulgar practical joke, bad public behaviour, only made me love and admire him more.  I felt more and more that he really was just like everybody else, an ordinary human being with lots of flaws, someone even more heroic because he had to work so hard to overcome his sordid past and to bring his bad traits under serious control.  I was so naïve I couldn't even read between the lines in all of the many scenes attempting to portray John or one of his friends as bad people or fools, like the insinuation that Yoko set up Paul's 1980 drug bust in Tokyo, or the scene where Linda McCartney called someone (David Spinoza?) to come over and help them with the recording of 'Ram,' where Spinoza later gave a sneering account to 'Melody Maker' about how Paul didn't know the names of any of the chords he was playing and that therefore he was a bad musician.<br />Finding out most of this book was a lie was like finding out there's no Santa Claus or Tooth Fairy, since I'd believed and treasured these stories for years, feeling that they made John more admirable and heroic since he had to suffer and overcome so much.  Many of these stories are urban legends, like John and Brian Epstein in bed together in Spain, wildly exaggerated stories, unverified anecdotes, and just plain lies.  Albert Goldman is like the boy who cried wolf; even if he is telling the truth in some instances, you have to doubt it because he's lied so many times before and been exposed as a liar in those instances.  And there are an awful lot of times where Goldman depicts John as being alone, or with only one other person, like his Aunt Mimi or Yoko, and tells us all of the personal thoughts in his head.  How would he know this if John was alone and never wrote those thoughts down, or he never expressed what was on his mind to the other person he was with?<br />Still, it was lively reading, a real page-turner, and even though I'm disgusted I believed every last word, I still vividly remember a lot of it years later.  And it does provide a lot of details on Yoko's art shows and her custody battle for her daughter Kyoko, which most other biographers haven't had much information on.

By claiming that Smith can not make knowledge claims without allegedly depending on Christianity for logical laws, the reviewer could be criticized for begging the question about the origin of logical laws. In fact, I am not even sure they had an origin. A theist may say they did with God, but by saying this, he implicitly affirms the truth of the law of identity even when there was only God and I have explained this further in my review elsewhere. <br />This Christian presuppositionalist labeled Smith a dogmatist yet he was a dogmatist himself. I would be tempted to call that hypocrisy but that would imply Smith actually is a dogmatist in the way the reviewer accused him of, but as is evident, these accuations totally fail. One final point is that throughout his reviw, this reviwer uses the word omniscience as meaning to know everything. Smith shows in his book that this characteristic of having unverified, automatic knowledge is unintelligible and plunges us into agnosticism.  Anyway, the omnimax God has been shown by philosophersto be incoherent. Something that is incoherent has no place in a discourse where intelligible things are being spoken of.	2004-05-08
US	32987921	R2NHOE8FUUQV3X	081840437X	652415915	The Hole in the Sheet: A Modern Woman Looks at Orthodox and Hasidic Judaism	Books	1	22	45	N	N	Thank God it's out of print	I stumbled on this book by accident while looking for some other books in the Judaism section of my university library my senior year.  I decided to check it out, since it certainly looked interesting, to say the least.  This book is a real page-turner and written in a lively manner, but so is Albert Goldman's 'The Lives of John Lennon,' and that book is just as trashy and blatantly untrue as this book, though at least TLOJL does have some truth buried under all of the sensationalism and wildly exaggerated stories based on unverified anecdotes.  This book has even more problems in the truth department.<br />I myself used to be very anti-Orthodox, since I got my picture of that denomination from the crazy fanatics always in the media, flamers and hate-mongers on the Jewish Community boards on aol, and disgruntled women who'd left Orthodoxy, on those same boards.  I never even really knew any Orthodox people until my senior year of college, though my opinion of them had been softening a bit before then.  The people I knew, the Orthodox, Modern Orthodox, Lubavitchers, Traditional Orthodox, etc., are nothing like the horrible people Mrs. Kaye says she grew up around.  I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she did have a terrible experience growing up, but could it be that adolescent rebellion or a drastic early adulthood break with all of the traditions she was raised with have coloured her perceptions and given her a false hindsight?  None of the Orthodox I've known love embarrassing people, feel it is their duty to embue their kids with discomfort and insecurity, nor are they racists or sexists.  This woman must not know that there are many Jews of colour, black, brown, yellow, tan, etc., and more of them than you'd think are born Jews instead of converts.  She is perpetrating the old myth that only Ashkenazic Jews exist or count, ignoring the many Jews whose origins are not in Eastern or Central Europe but in Italy, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Algeria, China, India, South America, etc.  She also claims that a devout Orthodox Jew violently hates all non-Jews and believes all manner of stereotypes about them, like they're all druggies, drunks, have horrible family lives, and are anti-Semites and untrustworthy.  I'm sorry if she grew up in such a hateful self-imposed ghetto like she says she did, but you can't discredit all of Orthodoxy by just one bad experience, as awful as it was!  She never even thought to try a different community or a different synagogue to see if she might have a more positive experience elsewhere.<br />I myself am not Orthodox, though I feel I have it in me to be if they resolve some of their issues about womens' roles, for example.  I have had only very positive experiences praying, eating, celebrating, and spending time, sometimes overnight, with the Orthodox people I met at college.  Mrs. Kaye obviously had the exact opposite types of experiences, but she grew up in the Forties and Fifties.  I think pretty much women and girls everywhere in America had that type of coming of age experience in that era; Orthodox or not, girls nowadays have a lot more opportunities and aren't overlooked just because they're not boys.  And Orthodoxy has changed a lot in the past 50 years or so; if Mrs. Kaye went back, and lived in a Modern Orthodox community, I'm sure she'd be shocked to find how well-educated the girls are, and how close they are to possibly having an Orthodox female rabbi within the next 50 years.<br />This book has a lot of anger in it, and seems to be written by someone who has unresolved issues.  It would be like a book written by a rape survivor who attacks all men everywhere, or a book by someone who left Catholicism before Vatican II because the atmosphere was too stifling for him/her.  It's not that your issues aren't real and painful, just that you should discuss them with a counselor instead of publishing them in a book before you've even tried to move past your awful past.  Mrs. Kaye can't stop spouting off lies and inaccuracies, being sarcasm and venomous, using superfluous exclamation points and capital letters, or putting words in people's mouths.  She thinks that women who say taharat hamishpacha (family purity) don't really feel like brides again and are only saying the exact same words the rabbis have told them to say.  So then all of these women are lies with no minds of their own.  She doesn't explain the true reasoning behind the morning blessing thanking God for not having made one a woman (it's very misunderstood, and I myself amn't keen on it, but it's not meant as a sexist insult).  She thinks only the Orthodox keep kosher, are shomer Shabbos and Yom Tov, clean the house for Pesach, or live any kind of observant life.  If she wants people to respect her decision to intermarry, be Reform, and completely abandon all Jewish traditions, she should respect people on the exact opposite of the spectrum.  On more than one occasion she completely insults the entire Talmud, and seemingly is ignorant to the fact that not all opinions are that of major rabbis, and if they are, no one opinion is meant to be taken as the only truth, such as on medical views of the time.  That's like wondering why President Washington was bled to death and his doctors laughed at the young doctor who wanted to do a tracheotomy; you're unfairly holding a different era to a modern standard and all of the hindsight and knowledge which has occured since then.  Most insulting of all is that she just can't believe any thinking woman would want to be Orthodox or Hassidic and is a brainwashed liar parroting what men have told her to say, and that these women have given up their minds and are living like ignorant peasant women in isolated African villages.  God forbid an intelligent modern woman should see the beauty in an Orthodox life and decide to join them, and still be a feminist while living a traditional Jewish life.  She is ignorant to the fact that the ketubah is insurance against a bad husband and is much fairer to women than practically every other culture at the time was to women.  And the list goes on and on.<br />Mrs. Kaye sadly doesn't want to leave her preconceived ideas behind her and actually listen to what the other side has to say, without already having her mind made up they're crazy, sexist, or parroting the rabbis.  Like Eleanor Roosevelt said, \\"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\\"outing off lies and inaccuracies, being sarcasm and venomous, using superfluous exclamation points and capital letters, or putting words in people's mouths.

Nevertheless, the inherent weaknesses of the instant history genre to which this book belongs is beginning to show. In short, this book is NOT a bona fide, thoroughly-researched and corroborated work of history. In fact, it's not a history at all, it's a self-satisfied memoir with a lot of unverified loose change tossed in. <br />Discrepancies in The March Up are beginning to appear in the press. In the March 2004 issue of the Marine Corps Gazette one veteran of the battle for An Nasiriyah states, \\"The truth was out there if only the authors would have asked. They [West and Smith] obviously should have researched the fight for An Nasiriyah more and gotten their facts straight before rushing to put this book out...[This book] is so glaringly wrong from the perspective of those of us who fought the battle of An Nasiriyah. I don't know whom the authors got their facts from, but they are just plain wrong. I was personally involved in the battle from start to finish...My question is why didn't the authors research this fight for the bridges more? Was there a reason to get this book done so fast that they couldn't interview more of us who were there?\\"<br />This is some tough talk from an eyewitness who isn't getting rich off of a hastily-written instant history as are the authors likely are. I used to recommend this book to friends and colleagues. Now I tell them what I told them in 1991, \\"Save your money. Wait three years for the real books to come out.\\"	2004-03-09

To start off with, my back ground is 10 years ex Naval aviation and the term \\"Flyboy\\" is not a flattering term I would use to describe me or any of my comrades and the author uses this term through out the entire book as if it were an honorary title or rank to be used in front of each veterans name. The book is written at a grade school level as if it were attempting to give a quick history lesson leading up to WWII and takes almost the first 3rd of the book to get to the real story, which leads me up to my biggest complaint about this book. The author uses obscure incidents and wars as well as unverified single sources to paint a picture of America as an evil imperial power that went around killing innocent people (In the Philippines) as the rule instead of the exception and the last time I checked my history books many thousands of American lives were lost \\"liberating\\" the Philippines in the fall of 1944 as well as hundreds more in Iraq to this day so I take offense to his twisting of history. The author sucked me in with the fancy book cover and catchy title into thinking I was about to learn more about some of the missing pieces of the vast puzzle that is WWII but instead was subjected (granted I could have stopped reading) to a liberal political correct story of how these American veterans deserved their fates because of past American actions. For people interested in learning about past American veterans try the \\"Medal Of Honor\\" book by Peter Collier and you will defiantly walk away feeling much more inspired with the human spirit. I feel the best books about veterans are generally those written by veterans and this author should think of a possible new career as a fiction writer and leave the history telling to others. Anybody want to buy my book?&lt;smile&gt;	2003-12-30

I have tried a few of these in the past, and for whatever reason, they work without a hitch; EVEN WHEN THEY SHOULD NOT WORK AT ALL.  SOME MACHINES IN THE BOOK ONLY NEED BE DRAWN, AND THEY WORK AS IF IT WAS AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL CONTRAPTION!<br />This book represents plans and 'machines' the author made himself, following plans from other inventors and experimenters.  He mentions other curious machines and theories, but, unfortunately for all of us, did not include any of those, as he felt they were 'unverified' by him.  It would have been an interesting trail to follow if he would have.  (Of course, for all of us tinkerers, how would it have been if Tesla had left simpler plans for us too?).<br />The ideas and machines in this book date from the 1950's.

Since the media is a follow-the-leader game, once a frame takes hold it doesn't let go very easily.  Jamieson and Waldman use this theory mainly to explore the 2000 Election between Gore and Bush.<br />Gore's many misstatements through his political career led the press to frame him as dishonest.  Bush's flubs through his short political career convinced the press to put him in the frame of unintelligent.  The result were campaign stories that asked voters to choose between the smart, but untrustworthy Gore and the dumb but affable Bush.  The examples of media coverage in the book support this theory pretty well.<br />Next the authors cite the examples of Gore's untruths and basically defend each one as a misunderstanding, leaving Gore as a more honest individual than painted by the media.  As a reader, I anticipated the authors next explaining that Bush was actually a smarter man than he was given credit for, after all he has an MBA from Harvard.  Instead the authors quote a New Yorker article where a reporter cites George W. Bush's average grades at Yale.  This is was a surprise, because the story was unverified by Yale and it doesn't take into account that grades have much more to do with ambition and drive than intelligence.  There was no attempt to give Bush the same credit that the authors spent giving Gore.  An opportunity to support their main thesis was left on the floor, which gives one the feeling that the real purpose of the book is to defend Gore not shame the media.  This same pattern is repeated when the authors discuss the Florida recount.<br />It's unfortunate that Jamieson and Waldman abandon the scholarly for the advocacy role because there is a lot of other research in the book that seems dead on.  They bemoan that fact that reporters do a terrible job of verifying the evidence and drawing conclusions.  Instead, the authors argue that the media play into the &quot;he said, she said&quot; game of political strategy.  The story becomes about how the candidates disagree with each other on their positions more than the actual substance of those positions.  They also state that the media loves to play psychologist when they should instead be playing fact-finder.<br />I found the basic theories in the book supported by good evidence.  But the advocacy of Gore and the silence on Bush in the analysis sections detracted from the book's purported goal of exposing the media's laziness.  I'm sure that the authors would say that they had no intention of propping up Gore, but parts of the book seem to strengthen the media frame on Bush which weakens the overall argument of the book.  This is surprising since Bush could have been defended as easily as Gore.<br />Anyway, I think the authors do a fine job casting a spotlight on the media's &quot;follow the leader&quot; approach and that's enough recommend it despite my other misgivings.ence and drawing conclusions.

Unless you are familar with the locations mentioned in this book, verify the information from another source before using it as a travel guide.  This book was not researched properly or edited.  Nearly all the locations in this book appears in other sources including other published books and old copies of the different Chicago and other local suburban newspapers dating back to the 1970's and 80's.  The large Chicago papers have printed most of these stories annually around Halloween since at least the 1970's.  This is what makes it hard to believe there are errors in this book.  Considering it says the Author is a native of the Chicago area she must never have left her office to verify locations she put in her book.  For example, it says Morton College on Harlem Ave. in Berwyn, Illinois is haunted.  The problem is that Morton College is located on Central Ave. in Cicero, Illinois and that is the haunted location--some 4 miles apart.  Morton West High School is located on Harlem in Berwyn and is not known to be haunted at all.  Also it is never mentioned that prior to the 1970's, Morton College was originally located in Morton East High School on Austin Blvd. in Cicero and that building is also known to be haunted.  If an error like this made it into the book, I would question the accuracy of the other parts of the book.  The correct address of the college could be gotten from calling the college itself.  Considering public and academic librarians have been using the internet for research since early-1990's, many of these errors could have been avoided by simple online searches.  I have been referring my graduate students to the internet for years to do simple online research, and now nearly everything is online.  When I worked on my undergraduate work in the 1980's the internet was not around, but completing my two masters degrees (one in library science) and now my second doctorate, the internet has been valuable.  As a college professor, I can say no college, university, or professor would accept inaccurate, unverified work, with missing information.  Work like this could not come from a respected researcher or writer.  I place some blame on the editors unless this was self-published, and then the blame is completely on the author.	2003-11-03

This I found interesting.  However, during this discussion the author demonized one Earl Butz, Secretary of Agriculture under Nixon.  I was a mere child during Nixon's years, so I know nothing of Earl Butz and therefore can't say one way or the other if he was the demon incarnate that the author makes him out to be or not.  Throughout the book, the author blames Butz for all of the evil fat-making foods on the market today.  This seems implausible to me that one single man could be responsible for so much.  I think it's more likely that these new processes of HFCS and palm oil was an *industry* trend that would have taken hold regardless of who happened to be Secretary of Agriculture.<br />Another annoyance is the author's strained efforts to make it seem like there's a conspiracy going on to fatten up the poor and non-white minorities in this country.  One such ludicrous example he gave was of the opening of a Krispy Kreme franchise in a Latino area of Southern California.  The author tries very hard, and unconvincingly, to use the fact that cars were lined up around the block for KK's opening as proof that the poor are targeted for fatty foods.  Is the author completely unaware that *every* KK opening is accompanied by lines of cars around the block, even in upper-class white-bread neighborhoods?!  How does a line of cars around a KK prove *anything*?<br />I'll list only one more annoyance, as I am probably approaching my 1000-word maximum!  The author quotes manystudies and draws completely illogical conclusions from them to support his conspiracy-theory hypothesis.  Several times, he compares figures for those in the under $25K/yr income bracket to those in the over $50K/yr bracket.  Each time he did this, I had to ask myself, what about the $25K-50K bracket?  Did he consistently leave the figures for this group out because the data for that category didn't support his weak and falacious hypothesis?  The language this supposed journalist uses shows he is far from your classical objective journalist.  He spends a lot of time blaming Proposition 13 (California, late 70s) for many fat-related woes, and refers to the proposition's author as &quot;cigar-chomping&quot; ... clearly intended to give us a negative image.   Later on in the book, he cites a study whose conclusions are rather shaky and unverified, but which, if true, would bolster his hypothesis.  So, how does he address this?  He states, &quot;Although [the conclusions of this study are] still somewhat speculative, the state-of-the-art explanation runs thus:...&quot;  How genially and complimentary he can write of an unsubstantiated theory as long as it helps prop up his hypothesis!<br />In summary, this book contains one or two interesting pieces of information on bad food ingredients (HFCS and palm oil), but having to read through the author's amateurish and hackneyed presentation along with stunning illogical support for his theories, makes this book extremely unworthy of anyone's time.	2003-11-02

John Shelby Spong wrote this book for people who could no longer accept the standard Christian theology. That certainly includes me, so I read his book with great interest. In many ways he mirrors my own thinking, but his long ecclesiastical background as an Episcopal Bishop gives us different vantage points.<br />Spong says the old concept of a theistic God is no longer useful in a modern world. God is not a person who lives in the sky and tinkers with our lives and sits in judgment. The steady march of knowledge about the vastness of the universe and our puny place in it has made that God obsolete. Spong is at his best when he is tracing the biblical roots of this God and showing how they arose, not out of any divine revelation, but were the natural product of the tribal societies with whom they originated.<br />I loved his chapter on \\"Jesus as Rescuer\\" in which he demolishes the doctrine that \\"Jesus died for our sins.\\" He goes on to argue against the Virgin Birth and Immaculate Conception, showing how, to people of the time, a sinless Jesus needed sinless progenitors. I was amused at his discourse on the Ten Commandments, as he actually pronounces some of them \\"immoral.\\" That's pretty heavy stuff. I was brought up Catholic, and I don't think the Catholic Church will be following Bishop Spong into rejection of these long-standing Christian ideas. I don't know much about Episcopalians (a church started by a king who wanted to divorce -- make that murder -- his wife!) but it seems to me these doctrines are the lever used to control people and perpetuate the church. The church will never let them go.<br />That brings me to my differences with Spong. He continually uses the word \\"worship;\\" he uses the word to mean the activity that goes on inside churches. It seems to me he has hung onto this word because there is no meaningful word for the hodgepodge of activities that occur inside church buildings. As to the word itself, surely a God who is in all of us and who encompasses the vast universe has no need to be worshiped. The whole idea of worshiping God is also obsolete, along with the other concepts Spong so deftly kills off.<br />I think he also misses the mark in his discussion of prayer. He asks why someone who is prayed for should recover from their illness while someone who is not prayed for does not recover. What kind of a God would be so influenced? What is wrong with this analysis, in my opinion, is the inclusion of God, who does not have to be involved in what we call prayer at all. Just as we do not need to worship God, neither do we need to petition him/her. Prayer, I believe, is really an aspect of non-local consciousness. It is a type of psychic phenomena if you will, a way one mind or spirit reaches out to another. The question is not who we pray TO but who we pray FOR.  We touch the other person or event with our spirit or inner energy. Prayer can be studied scientifically (to some extent) and studies have been done that seem to indicate prayer works.<br />In the same way, Spong does not offer us much in his discussion of life after death. While I like a lot of what he said about the value of what we do in this life, the real question is what happens when we die. Christian doctrine on this has emphasized the divine judgment which separates the good from the bad, relegating us to heaven or hell. Spong traces the theological roots back to the theistic God who is like a good parent, and the way these concepts of the next life were used by the church to control behavior in this life.<br />But is the concept of life after death totally bound up with reward and punishment? I think not. Today we have much evidence from Near Death Experience (NDE) and Out of Body Experience (OBE) and the testimony of mystics like Robert Monroe. There is a mini boom in contacting the dead (consider the popularity of John Edward's \\"Crossing Over\\") and millions of people accept these sources as proof that our spirits go on after we \\"cross over.\\" Again, where is God? He/she does not have to be in this equation either. The evidence seems to indicate that we take our emotional baggage with us to the other side, and we continue to grow spiritually in this new realm.<br />I also need to mention his attitude toward Jesus. Of course as a priest and bishop, Spong has had Jesus contiually in his life, and to say Jesus is just an interesting character in some ancient and unverified stories would be too painful. But Spong is willing to relegate many items in the Bible to mythical status, so why does he accept some (not all) of what is said about Jesus? Even interpreting the unacceptable (the birth in a stable, attended by three wise men, for instance) in new ways is hedging on whether anything written about Jesus is true. I agree that Jesus as described in the New Testament has much to offer. But how can we know what really happened thousands of years ago when the only testimony was written years later and has the bias of its time? Spong will not eliminate Jesus from his belief system, but many others who haven't spent decades in liturgical orthodoxy will.<br />So do all these transformations of the old Christian ideas mean there is no God? Not at all. I agree generally with Spong in his conclusions, but he is tied to his ecclesiastical past in a way that I am not. While I think churches have contributed to society by bringing people together and creating social bonds, and often doing good works, I cannot see how they can go on when the basic reason for their existence -- their theology, including Jesus -- can no longer be believed. Spong concludes his book by saying \\"I expect to enter even more deeply into the reality of the God in whom I have lived and moved and had my being.\\" Amen to that, but it does not require a church.over.\\" Again, where is God? He/she does not have to be in this equation either. The evidence seems to indicate that we take our emotional baggage with us to the other side, and we continue to grow spiritually in this new realm.<br />I also need to mention his attitude toward Jesus.

While I think churches have contributed to society by bringing people together and creating social bonds, and often doing good works, I cannot see how they can go on when the basic reason for their existence -- their theology, including Jesus -- can no longer be believed. Spong concludes his book by saying \\"I expect to enter even more deeply into the reality of the God in whom I have lived and moved and had my being.\\" Amen to that, but it does not require a church.	2003-10-05

Upon accepting the offer to become Chief Investigative Counsel of the House Judiciary Committee, David Schippers assembled a professional, hard-working, and highly ethical team to prepare impeachment proceedings against Clinton. A lifelong Chicago Democrat who worked for Robert Kennedy and voted for Clinton in both presidential elections, he nonetheless became thoroughly disenchanted with the \\"lies, cowardice, hypocrisy, cynicism, amorality, butt-covering\\" among House Democrats and the Senate. <BR> <BR>The second American president to be impeached, Clinton claimed the vast right-wing conspiracy was circumventing the Constitution. In fact, the impeachment process was specifically designed by the Founding Fathers as part of our system of checks and balances, but the Senate leadership ensured its failure. Schippers wanted to follow the procedure used against President Nixon, but the likes of Senator Ted Stevens quickly clarified that this was no Watergate: \\"I don't care if you prove he raped a woman and shot her dead-- you are not going to get [the] votes.\\" On whether the Senators would ignore their oath \\"to do equal and impartial justice,\\" he replies: \\"You're damn right they are.\\" One Democratic Congressman overheard as saying \\"My God, this is indefensible. The man is a perjurer, a liar, he's obstructing justice. How can we defend him?\\" nonetheless voted against impeachment. Among the rare voices of integrity was Democrat Joe Lieberman. <BR> <BR>Schippers is a straight-talker and doesn't pull any punches. Countering noncooperation from Attorney-General Reno's Department of Justice, he promises an Obstruction of Congress charge. When Reno refused to supply reports from FBI Director Louis Freeh and DoJ prosecutor Charles LaBella, he plays severe hardball and eventually nearly succeeds. Tipped off that the White House is setting him up, and if he accepts the reports they will be immediately leaked, Schippers declines them-- Clinton wins. <BR> <BR>Contrary to received propaganda, Clinton's transgressions were not about sex. Even with all the stonewalling and intimidation, the Judiciary Committee gathered evidence to support 15 separate felonies, among which perjury, witness tampering, and suborning perjury. Because of constraints imposed on the inquiry, much was not even investigated: illegal foreign campaign contributions (Chinagate), illegal possession of secret FBI personnel files (Filegate), the firing and slandering of the travel office staff (Travelgate), selling of Commerce Department junkets for campaign contributions (Commercegate), and perjury over his tawdry adulterous affairs with Kathleen Willey, Dolly Kyle Browning, and Gennifer Flowers. <BR> <BR>Clinton's rape (as Arkansas Attorney-General) of Juanita Broaddrick is simply heinous. When he appeared to have finished, he told his victim \\"My God, I can do it again!\\" and did. She kept quiet, and at a later fundraiser Hillary approached her and said \\"I've heard so much about you [...]. We appreciate everything you do,\\" though she hadn't worked for their campaign. When Clinton's conquests were subpoenaed in the Paula Jones case, they were pressured into providing false depositions or threatened (sometimes grotesquely). <BR> <BR>The White House coerced the INS to grant citizenship to aliens likely to vote Democratic by waiving normal security checks. Accounting firm KPMG established that over 250,000 aliens with certain or unverified arrest records obtained citizenship, and in a sample of 100 aliens with serious prior criminal records 20% now had FBI arrest records for serious crimes committed after obtaining citizenship. <BR> <BR>The day before the debate and vote on the articles of impeachment, Clinton bombs Iraq.  <BR> <BR>Schippers reproduces some of the support and hate mail he received, and one poignant letter is worth quoting: \\"I am writing to you because my friend Eddie saw you on TV and said you were moral and tough. My Dad is a lot like the President because he likes to have ladies sleep over when my Mom's away. I don't like that. I was wondering if you could help impeach my Dad?\\"	2003-08-15

Masterton has a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry and retired as a full Professor from the University of Connecticut in 1987. He had a long standing interest in this case, and began research after he retired (p.8). Chapters 1 to 8 give his short history of this crime, chapters 9 to 16 give his \\"solution\\". Many books have been written on the Borden Murders; the Sources on page 7 do not list those by E. Pearson and F. Spiering. Only two people were alive in that house after 11am. Lizzie was the likeliest suspect, but she couldn't have done it, and the jury agreed.    \\"Early accounts of the crime were loaded with factual errors\\" (p.18). This is a warning against using unverified newspaper records (p.8). Did Andrew Borden prosper handsomely (p.24)? The truth is that Andrew induced grieving customers to sign up for loans, then called these loans to foreclose on the homes. Andrew got rich by swindling widows and orphans! He became richer by buying into banks and factories, and real estate in growing Fall River. If one of his tenants received a higher salary, Andrew raised his rent. Andrew sold products from his home (p.25); he bought spoiled apple cider and sold it as vinegar. Page 34 quotes Bridget on the murders: \\"I'd be afraid to say anything at all. If I did, that terrible man that killed poor Mrs Borden might come back and kill me too.\\" What did she know and when did she know it?    Page 94 asks why Lizzie didn't burn that dress before the police searched the house. That would have left a residue in the stove. Page 107 talks about the three doors, but says nothing about cellar windows being used to get into the house. Page 124 says the assassin could go upstairs to the guest room to hide, but be discovered by Abby. The jury found Lizzie not guilty. The same lack of evidence also applies to Bridget, and Lizzie said \\"it wasn't Bridget ....\\" Robert Pinkerton says \\"an innocent person is more likely to make conflicting statements than is a guilty on.\\" (His firm was hired by Lizzie.)    Chapter 21 discusses the missing note. Could this explain why Abby went to the second floor guest room? AR Brown has a better explanation for this note. Her discovery of \\"Nemesis\\" led to her unplanned murder. Then this rage must have been directed to Andrew after he turned over that white box. The opinion of Dr Abbot (pp.200-1) seems to be political, not medical. JV Morse's answer (p.202) seems like a way to answer without saying anything. Chapter 14 questions the time of death for Abby. The fact is that Abby was last seen alive about 9:15am, her body was discovered around noon. Since she had been killed earlier than Andrew, the 90 minute estimate is dead accurate. The charts on page 205 are meaningless without indexes for time and temperature. The unscientific studies on page 206 are contradicted by Dr. Dolan's tests on the bodies. The trial testimony quoted on page 210 really means that if a stomach empties between \\"two or three hours\\" there is no estimate possible after this time. Nicole's empty stomach would put her death 3 hours after her 8pm supper. Ron's stomach should show eating between 10:30pm and 11pm (my estimate).    Chapter 16 has one of his solutions: an embezzling bank clerk who played the stock market But a white collar crime like this rules out a double murder? Was it JW Carpenter, who embezzled from Andrew's funeral business? Or maybe J Clegg? Masterton didn't solve the crime! Arnold R Brown's book provided the final solution in theory, because no one has come up with a better one. Masterton's fable violates the known facts of the case.	2003-04-14

David Brock spends most of his book describing his tremendous hand in bringing sleaze media into Republican politics.  He acknowledges many behind-the-scenes conservatives as well as other vested interests in the Republican party, which is helpful in perpetuating the reality of conservatism being the party attempting to legislate social norms and behaviors, but wanting government to remain distant from economics.  In this respect, it's moderately helpful.<br />I still feel awful about this book.  I can't fathom how a writer spends 300+ pages discussing how his bestsellers were assortments of eggagerations, misnomers, unverified facts, and selective truth telling, and then subsequently expects readers to accept and believe his contemporary perspective.  Given that he never explained at what point he learned bipartisan journalism, I really can't believe everything he claims; in particular, his treatment of his attitudes towards conservatism during his lengthy run in Washington as a sort of posturing for approval, silencing of his 'true identity', and other methods approximating brainwshing are simply unbelievable.<br />Overall, it's nice to see a title that attempts to apologise for one's actions as a conservative, one that additionally portrays the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" for what it really is (an attempt to create an image of a \\"vast left-wing conspiracy,\\" such that the populace remains distracted enough, leaving their guard down to swallow conservative theory without question).<br />The message I received from the book could be considered \\"Hey, don't believe this, that stuff is a lie.  Believe *this* instead!\\"  David Brock did enough damage during his career already, and I consider myself to be one bleeding heart liberal type who thinks that he owes this nation more than an apology (especially given the self-serving nature of his self-cleansing text here).	2003-01-09

The justification for keeping Dan's true identity secret struck me as false. Nerburn spends an extended amount of time staying with and traveling with the man; everyone around is sure to know who this White man is and what he is doing with Dan, yet supposedly he must now be kept anonymous to \\"protect\\" him. From whom? If it happened as told, everyone knew long ago.<br />\\"Grover\\" seems to be a fictional character used to set up Nerburn's narrative. His advice on how to tell the story is straight out of Creative Writing 101, Week 1, yet Nerburn acts as though he is utterly shocked by it. I'm guessing that \\"Grover's\\" words are Nerburns own advice to anyone telling a story.<br />That said, the book is essentially a New Age version of the Noble Savage. It's a dehumanizing one, because it denies the humanity of the indigenous peoples of this continent and reduces them to a stereotype. Real people are neither all good nor all bad; neither all pure nor all evil. The indigenous people of this continent were real people, not cartoons.<br />The Indians most definitely had a great environmental awareness, but did they really \\"walk lightly upon the earth\\"? Did they never waste, did they always show respect for all forms of life? Simply, no. <br />For example, \\"Using all parts of the buffalo\\" (bison) was the exception, not the norm. When bison populations were at their peak, there was a huge amount of waste. Large groups (more than 1000 at a time) were killed, by such means as driving them over a cliff, driving them into a river or onto soft ice on a body of water, or by engulfing them in a massive wall of fire. Frequently, only the choice parts, such as the tongue and the hump, were taken.(One tribe took only the fetuses). This was especially true if the hunt was for a ceremony or celebration, in which those favored parts, as delicacies, were to play a prominent role. Often, the bulls which were killed were ignored and left to rot, because their meat and hides were tougher than the cows'.<br />Often bison were hacked up while still alive. Bison which survived a fire were left wandering burned and blind, in agony. The cruelty was enormous.<br />If you read this book, read also \\"The Ecological Indian, Myth and History\\" by Shepard Krech to get a dispassionate and objective look at the myths which make up books like Nerburn's.	2003-01-07

Dr. Feinberg describes a political scandal as anything in a public officials professional or personal life that defies the code of conduct Americans set for themselves. She astutely notes that since morals change, so may the behavior thought sufficient to reach scandal status. She excludes scandals that do not involve political or personal morality (although many early scandals such as the Peggy Eaton Affair seem to fall outside this scope), and does not discuss unverified accusations.  Thus, she mentions (in Chapter 1) that there is no mention of the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings or the charge that the release of hostages in Iraq was timed to influence the 1980 election.<br />For the most part, the book focuses on egregious and important scandals, along with a few of the more vivid episodes (e.g., the beating of Senator Sumner in the Senate Chamber, and the Hamilton/Burr duel) to keep things interesting.  Dr. Feinberg categorizes the many scandals into Violent Political Quarrels, Controversial Election Returns,  Affairs of the Heart, Political Office for Personal Profit, Public Displays of Personal Misconduct, and Abuse of Power. Unfortunately, the book predates the impeachment of Clinton, and the 2002 election irregularities, although there is an excellent section on the abuses of Iran-Contra (although the defense position is not discussed).  She wisely concludes, although the government is not scandal proof, it is not permanently scandal-ridden, and she reminds readers of the governmental and journalistic checks against scandal.  Although limited by its brevity, Dr. Feinberg presents three theories about the prevalence of scandal in the Grant, Harding, Nixon, and Reagan eras.

THE LITTLE FRIEND, her long awaited second novel, exceeds all expectations. And, while we may never know the reasons for the wide gap between the two books, only the results matter . Suffice it to say, the lady has outdone herself, and her latest effort has been worth the wait.<br />The setting is Alexandria, Mississippi where the Dufresne/Cleve families, suffered a terrible tragedy that changed the course of their lives irrevocably. One Mother's Day, Robin, their nine-year-old son was murdered. \\"Mrs. Fountain saw him first.\\" Her screams brought Charlotte Cleve Dufrense, his mother, running, \\"He was hanging by the neck from a piece of rope, slung over the low branch of the black-tupelo that stood near the overgrown privet hedge [that divided the Dufrense property from the Fountain's] he was dead.\\"<br />The only possible \\"witnesses\\" to his murder were his younger sisters, Allison, who was four years old and the baby, Harriet. If they saw anything it was buried in the deepest recesses of their psyches, not to be recovered. For years the townspeople buzzed and gossiped speculating about who could be responsible for such a horrendous crime. Suspicion was everywhere and nowhere, and in the end, the investigation was dropped.<br />Robin's family never discussed his brutal murder; rather, they chose to remember him as a lively, lovable little boy, who brought joy to those whose lives he touched. hether or not their anecdotal remembrances were real was never an issue, ....<br />Harriet's mother never quite forgave herself for Robin's death and she withdrew into an \\"&#133;indifference that numbed and colored every area of her life,\\" and her older daughter, Allison, followed her into the same dreamy netherworld. Dix Cleve, the adulterous absentee father, moved to another state and only occasionally came home to visit.<br />But his absence transmogrified the Dufrense/Cleves into a matriarchal family whose driving force is Charlotte's mother, Edith, the children's fierce, no-nonsense grandmother. Edith's sisters make up the rest of the clan and they are Harriet's support system. They all live within walking distance of each other and when Harriet needs comfort or company she turns to her great aunts who welcome her kindly.<br />Tartt establishes all of this with languid prose that propels the reader into the action twelve years after Robin's death. Harriet, already a force a to reckon with is smart, snobbish, angry, manipulating, independent, fiercely loyal and very strong. She is a misfit among her peers, she doesn't share their interests, she is a scholar by nature and has only one friend, Hely Hull, a boy who idolizes her and would do anything for her.<br />Together the two pals devise a plan to avenge Robin's death. Harriet commits herself with obsessive tunnel vision to finding the killer. With snippets of unverified rumors she focuses her outrage on one man, which puts her and Hely in the center of a tangled web of danger, deceit, destruction and death.<br />Tartt's detailed depiction of the mores of life in a small southern town, with an underbelly as corrupt and dangerous as any urban center, throbs with pathos. She has given readers a provocative novel which is interesting and suspenseful; part murder mystery, part coming of age tale, part a child's story, part a story of loyalty and friendship, part an interlocutory on the American justice system, part a study in southern culture and mores, part a commentary on the little ways families chip away at themselves, especially in the face of tragedy or death, only to find their center implodes and leaves a haunting void in its wake.<br />Of the major motif Tartt says, \\"This is a book about children, but it's not a book for children. It's a frightening book. It's a scary book. It's fairly dark. It's about children coming into contact with adults ... and coming into contact with the world of adults in a very frightening way.\\" She also maintains, time and patience are the most important elements a writer must cultivate in order to do \\"it\\" perfectly. She admits that she writes slowly and says; too, \\"There are no real messages in my fiction. The first duty of the novelist is to entertain. It is a moral duty.\\" And these beliefs, put into practice, is precisely what makes THE LITTLE FRIEND such a rich, passionate book in the spirit of Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, while at the same time, it is imbued with the dark humor and loss of innocence vividly portrayed in HARRIET THE SPY.<br />THE LITTLE FRIEND is a treasure and readers can only hope that Ms. Tartt doesn't take ten years to produce another gem.<br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum	2002-11-09

This is one of the best. It offers what I consider to be a uniquely comprehensive, cohesive, and time-effective system which Schiffman calls a \\"Prospect Management\\" program.  Apparently this system have been adopted, in some instances modified, and then implemented by more than 1,800 different organizations. I agree with Schiffman that the word \\"organizations\\" is more appropriate than \\"companies\\" because colleges,  universities, and churches as well as other non-profits must also generate substantial revenue from their respective constituencies. If anything, their need to manage their \\"prospects\\" effectively is even greater than is the need of for-profits. Benefactors, for example, must be convinced to sustain (if not increase) their financial support; volunteers must be enlisted; and staff members must \\"buy into\\" necessary changes in policy and procedure. All organizations (regardless of size or nature) will derive substantial benefit from the wealth of information and insights which he shares in this book.<br />Schiffman carefully organizes his material within three separate but interrelated Parts: The Fundamentals, Learning the System, and Getting Up and Running. The foundation of the \\"Prospect Management\\" program consists of complete and current information about prospects which is prioritized and then classified within four active stages of the sales cycle. First,  decision-makers who have agreed to a preliminary meeting; next, decision-makers who then specifically indicate interest and agree to discuss budgets and pricing; next, decision-makers who have made at least a verbal agreement; and finally, decision-makers who have become customers, (i.e. signed a contract). Schiffman also has another category, \\"Fallbacks/opportunities\\": assumed but unverified decision-makers with whom initial contact has been made but who are not as yet prospects. \\"These are candidates, suspects, leads or referrals -- people [you] want to do business with, but with whom [you] do not yet have a real relationship.\\" Because change is the only constant in today's business world, Schiffman correctly emphasizes the importance of constantly updating the prospect database. Hence the need for constantly obtaining new information. Subjected to rigorous evaluation, the information is  converted it into intelligence data which guide and inform the \\"Prospect Management\\" program.<br />As Schiffman would be the first to point out, the \\"Prospect Management\\" program as he presents it may not be wholly appropriate in all respects to a given sales organization. That is to say, decision-makers must be prepared to make whatever modifications may be necessary. For example, consider how varied sales cycles are (e.g. those for a Boeing 777, an SUV, a  major appliance, an insurance policy, or a pair of sneakers); also, the differences between and among so-called \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" salespersons; also,  the number of decision-makers and decision-influencers involved. Nonetheless, the basic principles of Schiffman's \\"Prospect Management\\" program remain valid no matter who is selling what to whom.<br />Some of the best material is provided within five appendices but I strongly recommend that they be read only after reading the 20 chapters which precede them. Schiffman introduces and then explains his system step-by-step. There is a continuity to his thinking which is reflected in the sequence of the material provided. With great care, he \\"walks\\" his reader through that material. Also, at the end of  the first 18 chapters, he includes a \\"Quick Quiz\\" for the reader. (The correct answers can be found after the final chapter.) If at times the narrative seems redundant (and it does), that is because there are several key points worthy of being reiterated. The accumulative impact ensures that those key points will be retained in the reader's mind long after the book has been read.<br />Obviously, I think highly of this book. However, given the importance of maximizing sales and (yes) commissions, I think salespersons and especially those who supervise them should consult several different sources of information and counsel. Therefore, I also highly recommend Rackham's SPIN Selling, Boylan's The Power to Get In, and Werth's High Probability Selling. Each of these also offers much of value. However, I again stress the importance of formulating, implementing, and then constantly fine-tuning a cohesive, comprehensive, and time-effective sales program.

This book is fairly well written, but the ending chapters and appendicies appear to have been assembled in haste and are somewhat of a letdown. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that Clayson often seemed unaccountably mean-spirited toward Harrison. Come to think of it, he gets in digs at James Taylor, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen and several others mentioned in the book, all with very little explanation. Clayson also fails to tie up many threads in Harrison's life, including his relationship with Paul McCartney, who of course brought George into the Quarrymen.  George's friendship with Ravi Shankar is also slighted (Shankar described this quite well - including their work together in the 1990s - in the book Raga Mala). The book needs a summing up of Harrison's life, but instead ends with an intriguing but perhaps unverified story of George meeting &amp; jamming with some country and western musicians during his first visit to the U.S. Perhaps a better accounting of George Harrison's life will be possible after some of his unreleased recordings become available and his family and friends have opened up to someone better suited than Alan Clayson to tell George's story.	2002-06-23

Willy-nilly he has broken the door down and brought his 'design' consideration (I won't say 'argument') into the scientific domain, if not fully across the threshold of scientific proof, as far as I can tell. And you are on your own here, since even many of the supposed scientific counterarguments are little more than party line fiat. Before embarking on this subject, it is important to recall the Kantian skepticism and disproofs of the Argument by Design, and know the odds against design arguments in general. Dembski has two strikes against him to start. And this book is a cliffhanger as Dembski takes a wallop with his third strike. Fascinating. But this issue of proofs of divinity isn't really Dembski's business, as he embarks on a complex exploration of the factor of information as this impinges on the clear inadequacy of the standard Darwinian claims that random mutation and natural selection can make the ascent to complexity that we see as evolutionary fact. But the problem is that an argument about 'design' is taken in practice as precisely an argument by design in other contexts, rendering the whole game ambiguous. The question of frontloaded anthropic factors versus 'late interrupt' emergence of information is one that should be brought back to discussion, as here, stripped of theological or miraculous metaphors is a real head scratcher. Even if his arguments fail upon deeper review, the reality he deals with remains tabled, and too often disregarded by Darwinian thinkers, for whom, Darwin's theory is unverified dogma. Dembski is often challenged for lack of peer review, which is unfair. The credentials of his original _Design Inference_ were adequate enough, and this short version is well within science discourse. In fact, I find this work an unofficial and always still challengeable bit of peer review of its own, as it is infrequent for someone with the proper math skills to give Darwinism a once-over. The material on the No Free Lunch theorems alone is a useful one. Which doesn't make his version correct. All this said, such complex technical arguments always have their day, and can easily be found wanting themselves. It is hard to improve on Socrates original observation on this distinction of intelligent design and natural cause. It is a useful challenge to be confronted with some tough math here (not so tough, nor really decisive), and one's endorsement is on hold during that catch-up and this in the constant disinformation by the fibs, white 'lies' and Darwinian statistics that throw everyone off scent. Grappling with the missing factor in theories of evolution, and it need not even be called 'design', remains the great quest for any real theory of evolution. I cannot quite say this is that science, but neither is Darwin's and Darwin's theory joins Dembski's in the strange limbo pointed to by Bacon, where the formal and final arguments of Aristotle are, or are not, to be included in the scientific domain. If they are, then theories of evolution hazard the metaphysical. The claims of Darwin to resolve these metaphysical issues in one stroke then are clearly wrong.<br />Dembski has an exposed flank with his very use of the term 'design', both as to the equal need, next to the Darwinist, of empirical verification of his theories, and the question raised by issues of 'design' in history, confused with necessity. Shall we take the evolution of religion (and in, say, the Axial period, atheistic and theistic religions in parallel) as chance, necessity, or design? Dembski has here outsmarted himself, for this 'design' question won't sit well with historical theism's claims. Thus we see this 'design' argument is of no help to the theological conservative, and faith cannot be brought to historical data that is now rendered over to this 'design semi-science' that now claims religious emergence as possibly itself evolution.<br />It is also true that the use of the term 'intelligent' in the term 'intelligent design' is in the end hopelessly ambiguous, as is the challenge to methodological naturalism, which is routinely extended in other religious traditions. Since intelligence should be natural, and not be applicable to divinity, we are left with a need to ask what this refers to at all. We cannot say that the examples in practice of 'design' in human agents is counter to naturalism! The question might be better backtracked to terminology of evolutionary directionality, and/or teleology, that dragon the Darwinist rightly fears, and whose fiery breath is destined to scorch Darwin's fond little 'my theory'. This work by Dempski will promptly be exploited for theological purposes, or pseudo-supernatural speculations. None of this follows as such.sm's claims.

Scientifically, Mr. Ford makes no mistake, as there are many antioxidants in wine (primarily anthocyanins extracted from tannin-rich reds); however, one cannot overlook that wine contains alcohol, a chemical which has been well-documented as toxic.  The French Paradox provides for very interesting reading, as it sheds an entirely new perspective on a long-examined indulgence.

Her drug use served to intensify her emotional problems, distorted her personality, ruined her career, and ultimately took her life.  These are facts, and any Garland biography that attempts to gloss over them does a disservice to its subject, who deserves the dignity of truth.  But Sheridan Morley and Ruth Leon's JUDY GARLAND: BEYOND THE RAINBOW does not simply meet these facts, it turns them into superficial tabloid trash complete with pat explantions and superficial interpretations; worse still, the text is riddled with factual inaccuracy, relies upon rumor and mean-spirited speculation, and makes no attempt to place Garland's difficulties in perspective with the other aspects of her life.<br />I can think of no other Garland text, including the absolutely abominable biography by Anne Edwards, that so ill-serves its own subject.  It is filled with unverified and self-serving gossip delivered in such a nasty tone that one wonders how Morley and Leon manage to sleep at night.  If you wish to read a legitimate portrait of Garland, I recommend you seek out Christopher Finch's meticulously researched and elegantly written RAINBOW: THE STORMY LIFE OF JUDY GARLAND (sadly, now out of print) or Gerald Frank's exhaustive JUDY instead--and avoid this piece of coffee table trash as you would the plague.	2002-04-03

It is very entertaining, to say the least, and does contain some insights.  All of people in the book are easily described like cartoon characters in terms of their outer motives, their inner motives and their subconscious needs.  <br />It parallels other interesting works such as Machiavelli's &quot;The Prince&quot; and scores of ancient writings in philosophy in that its conclusions are based on 99% argument and 1% evidence.  Largely, this is because it is based on arbitrary, unverified models of human behavior.<br />I honestly believe that Robert Greene has mostly tried to make a compelling work of art here.  Most of his assertions are not supported with scientific evidence or even balanced historical evidence.  The book reads like a religious text, filled with unquestioned assertions.  There are no qualifying statements about the content of the book whatsoever; there are no statements that document the certainty of the &quot;truths&quot; in the book based on the strength of evidence.  Everything in the book is flatly stated.  The text itself is written like a documentary about society narrated by an amoral, omniscient deity whose words reflect a potent combination of all of the described techniques of seduction<br />In this way, the book is a self-referencing paradox.

We have this book online: [...] <BR>It has now been about one hundred and sixty years since the first publication of perhaps the greatest apologetics book of all times. It is true that there are many fine books suited for their specific objects, and not less true that many valuable books have fulfilled a particular demand in the needful evidences for the Christian Evangelical Faith; but none can be found that has so comprehensively covered the ground in a way that not only reaches all essential beliefs or doctrines necessary for life in this world and that to come, but that also has been so recognized by the church at large to be so. When we come to this volume and are delightfully and almost magnetically carried through it, we soon find that it is not such a piece of the puzzle that books before it were, but rather it satisfies the heart and mind of the candid inquirer quenching his universal and systematic desires for the unified system of belief.<BR>  In the introduction below, we are informed that the arguments presented in this volume are largely independent of other works and not borrowed. Notwithstanding the style and harmony of all the chapters however, it can be seen through the works we are publishing that the major ideas were borrowed from worthy and spiritually sympathetic authors just previous to the first publication. And much more than Darwin, who organized an unsystematized-and unfortunately false-natural philosophy into a compelling system which thus gave it credibility, our author gives us more than a coherent hypothesis yet to be verified, but rather a presentation that unifies the subjects of the highest importance with the best demonstrations from all the important departments of the mind and life.<BR>  Those familiar with Asa Mahan's encyclopedic writings on all major branches of philosophy will find a very close identity of presenting the philosophical ideas in this book. Equally manifest will be the relation to Charles G. Finney's understanding of reformation and disinterested benevolence. And while Jonathan Edwards first presented this last idea less developed, our author no doubt also borrows much from him in his analysis of the Affections. We will finally notice but one more author, Caleb Burge, whose monumental work on the Atonement in 1822 must have had influence on the illustrations given in this work.<BR> These men all shared the same moral government and orthodox understanding of the Plan of Salvation, and their profound works in our opinion helped to elevate society and the church to a higher level than it ever knew and has since known. The reason is plain-not that they invented new ideas, or were clever to manipulate men by sophestry-on the contrary, they simply acknowledged their true limitations, sought answers from all facts available, depended upon no unverified evidence, focused on essential matters in the nature of their circumstances, and insisted upon no weak arguments, but gave us an impartial, coherent, system of practical truth that was only to convince an honest mind.<BR>  Some years back we endeavored to compile a similar work, not yet being familiar with this. It is now wondered whether that work would not be a disservice to the subjects defended in comparison with this masterpiece. We do not see the need to improve our work to this level, and are convinced that the world and the church do not need anything further to be satisfied with the objects of this book. In the future it will thus be our desire to only slightly adapt this work to our day (as this was a book for the times) in a recording of this volume for tapes and CD.<BR>We are selling this book $9.50 in print: TruthInHeart.com 616-447-8124	2002-02-04

Chief among them is the myth that thousands of scientific papers actually address Behe's challenge.<br />At the ARN website, however, Behe shreds these initially impressive but shoddily-compiled claims:<br />&quot;The assertion here that very many papers have been published clashes with statements of the reviews I quoted earlier which say, for example, that &quot;The problems have indeed been sorely neglected.&quot; (Cavalier-Smith 1997) Would reviewers such as Jerry Coyne and Tom Cavalier-Smith--both antagonistic to my proposal of intelligent design--be unaware of the &quot;hundreds, possibly thousands, of scientific papers that deal with this very subject&quot;? Both claims--that the problems have been neglected and that the problems are being actively investigated--cannot be correct. Either one set of reviewers is wrong, or there is some confusion about which publications to count. Which is it?<br />&quot;In the context of my book it is easy to realize that I meant there has been little work on the details of the evolution of irreducibly complex biochemical systems by Darwinian means. I had clearly noted that of course a large amount of work in many books and journals was done under the general topic of &quot;molecular evolution,&quot; but that, overwhelmingly, it was either limited to comparing sequences (which, again, does not concern the mechanism of evolution) or did not propose sufficiently detailed routes to justify a Darwinian conclusion. Yet the Catalano site lists virtually any work on evolution, whether it pertains to irreducible complexity or not. For example it lists semi-popular books such as Patterns in Evolution: The New Molecular View by Roger Lewin, and general textbooks on molecular evolution such as Molecular Evolution by Wen-Hsiung Li.<br />&quot;Such books simply don't address the problems I raise. ... [Li's book] does not include how specific, irreducibly-complex biochemical systems were built. The text contains chapters on the molecular clock, molecular phylogenetics, and other topics which essentially are studies in comparing gene sequences. As I explained in Darwin's Black Box, comparing sequences is interesting but cannot explain how molecular machines arose. Li's book also contains chapters on the mechanisms (such as gene duplication, domain shuffling, and concerted evolution of multigene families) that are thought to be involved in evolution at the molecular level. Again, however, no specific system is justified in Darwinian terms.<br />&quot;... Li himself has not done work on understanding how the obstacles to the evolution of the clotting cascade may have been circumvented. Since those investigators who do work in that area have not yet published a detailed Darwinian pathway in the primary literature (1), we can conclude that the answer will not be found in a more general text. We can further assume that the processes that text describes (gene duplication, etc.), although very significant, are not by themselves sufficient to understand how clotting, or by extension any complex biochemical system, may have arisen by Darwinian means.<br />&quot;Catalano's site lists other books that I specifically discussed in Darwin's Black Box, where I noted that, while they present mathematical models or brief general descriptions, they do not present detailed biochemical studies of specific irreducibly complex systems. (Gillespie 1991; Selander et al. 1991) There is no explanation on Catalano's web site of why he thinks they address the questions I raised.<br />&quot;... In Finding Darwin's God (Miller 1999) Kenneth Miller is also anxious to show my claims about the literature are not true (or at least are not true now, since the handful of papers he cites in his section &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; were published after my book appeared). Yet none of the papershe cites deals with irreducibly complex systems. ...&quot;<br />Seems like it's time for fundamentalist Darwinists to be a little more skeptical, a little more open-minded - and a little more rational. Behe's book gently nudges them back towards empirical science, rather than evolutionism, which one frustrated evolutionist finally proclaimed &quot;a fairy-tale for grown-ups.&quot;pers he cites deals with irreducibly complex systems. ...&quot;<br />Seems like it's time for fundamentalist Darwinists to be a little more skeptical, a little more open-minded - and a little more rational.

I think that his attempt to intermingle social history with the shark incidents is interesting. Unfortunately, his investigation of the 1916 New Jersey shark attacks is a mishmash of facts, errors, and fanciful views. One imaginative section deals with a supposed linkage between German espionage in America, U-boats along the East Coast, and the shark attacks. I will deal with this later. Then there are glaring errors in at least one section. <br />First of all, during the summer of 1916, only one German merchant submarine appeared on the East Coast, not &quot;U-boats in multiple U.S. ports.&quot; Fernicola may be confusing the friendly visit made to a New England port several months later by U-53. Fernicola refers again to visits on the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts during this time by two German U-boats, the &quot;Deutschland&quot; and the &quot;Bremen.&quot; The &quot;Deutschland,&quot; an undersea unarmed freighter arrived in Baltimore on July 10, 1916 and returned to the States on November 1. Actually, the &quot;Bremen,&quot; the other merchant sub mentioned by Fernicola, never reached the American seaboard, as it was lost at sea soon after departing Germany.<br />The author would have you believe that the submarines were to carry condensed milk and foodstuffs back to Germany.

I think that his attempt to intermingle social history with the shark incidents is interesting. Unfortunately, his investigation of the 1916 New Jersey shark attacks is a mishmash of facts, errors, and fanciful views. One imaginative section deals with a supposed linkage between German espionage in America, U-boats along the East Coast, and the shark attacks. I will deal with this later. Then there are glaring errors in at least one section. <br />First of all, during the summer of 1916, only one German merchant submarine appeared on the East Coast, not &quot;U-boats in multiple U.S. ports.&quot; Fernicola may be confusing the friendly visit made to a New England port several months later by U-53. Fernicola refers again to visits on the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts during this time by two German U-boats, the &quot;Deutschland&quot; and the &quot;Bremen.&quot; The &quot;Deutschland,&quot; an undersea unarmed freighter arrived in Baltimore on July 10, 1916 and returned to the States on November 1. Actually, the &quot;Bremen,&quot; the other merchant sub mentioned by Fernicola, never reached the American seaboard, as it was lost at sea soon after departing Germany.<br />The author would have you believe that the submarines were to carry condensed milk and foodstuffs back to Germany. This was only one of many rumors as to the submersibles' intended cargo. The fact is, it became well-known before her departure from Baltimore in August that the &quot;Deutschland&quot; would carry much-  needed metals and crude rubber as a valuable military cargo.<br />Let me mention a few more inaccuracies.

Further, the abbreviations section could be more detailed in defining significant terms and distinguishing the definitions thereof, such as independent, broker, syndicator, funder, etc. Though I have been in the business for 10 years and understand what these terms mean, they become foggy when different companies have their own idea what they are or worse yet, when companies lie about their true identities and capabilities.<BR>Phillip Nichols<BR>Managing Director<BR>Zions Corporate Advisory<BR>801-583-0347<BR>801-583-0348 FAX	2001-09-20

It is a VERY dull read. There is nothing shocking here for any serious fans that would actually buy this book. To Summarize: No, there is no evidence that the mafia influenced Frank getting his breakthrough role in &quot;From Here to Eternity,&quot; no, there is no evidence that Frank was a member of the communist party, yes, there is some evidence that Frank had some casual contact with members of organized crime (as has EVERY major Hollywood star), yes, Frank and Kennedy partied together. This book is more of an indictment of Hoover's heavy-handedness as head of the FBI. They just kept digging and digging on Frank, but really found virtually nothing. The biggest things they had on him was that he was arrested when he was 22 for having an affair with a married woman, that he initally told the draft board that he was in perfect health and later pointed out that he had a perforated eardrum (verified as true) and a neurosis about being in crowds (unlikely, but unverified as true or false), and that he fibbed about whether Chicago organized crime figure Sam Giancanna was at a show that Sinatra was also at in Atlantic City. BIG DEAL! The lack of dirt here proves what I always suspected, that Frank Sinatra was merely a vicitm of b.s. tabloids and a paranoid Cold-War government. The &quot;Sinatra Files&quot; reveal that Frank was actually a very stand-up guy and great American citizen.	2001-08-28

This book appears to be a systematic compilation of research.<br />However, if we examine more closely the source of the information, we find that it is derived from sessions with a psychic trance medium who is channeling the words of discarnate entities. The book is then padded with lots of footnotes and references to information from books. So, let's give the author credit for the ability to collect and organize information from many sources in this world and the next.<br />But is this true research? Where are the case studies, the clinical trials and practitioner reports which could corroborate this information? Where is the field work with the plants to confirm the qualities and healing powers that are attributed to them?<br />With its charts and systematic organization the book seems to be the result of meticulous research. In fact, it is a collection of highly speculative, unverified claims, and thus it is dangerously irresponsible.<br />This reviewer does not discount the possibility that talented individuals can access information from other dimensions of reality. But such activity is not passive. It is our responsibility to substantiate the accuracy and truth of information we gather from other sources, be they discarnate or of this world. <br />Gurudas has not done this, .. however attractive it appears. <br />It is unfortunate that this book has become a model for countless others to wander off into delusional flights of unexamined psychic fancy in the creation of vibrational essences of all kinds. <br />Gurudas cites the spiritual philospher and initiate Rudolf Steiner in many references, footnotes throughout the book. But we search in vain for the sobriety of real spiritual research of the kind championed by Steiner and those inspired by his example.	2001-07-13

It will give you all the details on how Wicca came to be created in the mid-twentieth century, based on literary, artistic, and academic fashions, the practices of fraternal orders and occult societies, old and new folk customs, and other cultural roots (real and imagined) going back to the 1700s. Hutton leaves no hope for those who wish to believe in a constantly existing Pagan religion in Britain or in a connection between the early modern witch trials and Paganism. No one can claim to be knowledgeable about the true history of modern Witchcraft who has not read and carefully studied this text.    This meticulously documented book pounds the final nails into the coffin of the claims Gardner made (and others inflated) that Wicca was an ancient surviving British Pagan religion of Witchcraft. None but the most stubbornly fundamentalist of Orthodox Wiccans can deny it any longer, though they have  continued to try.    Hutton's work supports and amplifies the research into Wiccan history that I and other modern writers have done over the last thirty years. Indeed, the chapters in my book Bonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca on Gerald Gardner and the birth of Wicca owe a great deal to his clear exposition of complex details.    Every Wiccan should have this book on their shelves.    A PS for 2006: Many of the complaints by other reviewers here seem to me to be attempts to substitute unverified (and deliberately unverifiable) claims by modern Pagan authors to \\"secret evidence\\" they supposedly have access to that Hutton did not. Others are attempts to use misdirection by saying that Classical religions had (and Classical writers mentioned) goddesses similar to what modern Wicca has and \\"therefore\\" Wicca is ancient. No, because Gerald Gardner studied those ancient religions and read many of those Classical authors. Just using bits and pieces of something old in your invention doesn't constitute \\"proof\\" that your invention is itself old. Gardner was a brilliant creative artist who started something wonderful. Let's give him the credit he deserves and stop trying to shoot the messengers who have revealed his creative efforts. As for Hutton, I know him personally, and I know that he is far from being a \\"hostile enemy\\" to Wicca, being instead a sympathetic yet honest scholar. The Neopagan movement needs more authors like Hutton, not fewer.	2001-07-10

Verification and validation are two important, if often misunderstood, aspects of delivering the big three: Reliability, Availability and Support.  One of the reasons for this is technology has outstripped methods, which is what this book rectifies.  V&amp;V is not pre-production testing where the goal is to break the application or product, but is a functional qualification test (also known as user acceptance test or product test), where the goal is to ensure that what you have meets requirement specifications. Specifically, verification answers &quot;did we build the right thing?&quot; and validations answers &quot;did we build it right?&quot;<br />It's one thing to perform V&amp;V for products and monolithic applications and quite another to apply these techniques to more complex systems.  This book updates the V&amp;V body of knowledge by showing how to perform V&amp;V in objected-oriented and distributed environments, with an emphasis on specific system types such as data warehouses, inter- and internet systems, etc.<br />The authors start with a description of processes, models and standards that give you a foundation for incorporating V&amp;V, and then discuss tools and methodologies, documentation and metrics.  I especially liked the metrics provided, which will allow you to effectively and accurately measure your V&amp;V process.<br />Another strong point about this book is that it addresses objected-oriented methods, which are difficult to verify and validate.  Here is a real life example why:  a global 50 company bought into a directory-enabled security scheme as the basis for their enterprise security. Such schemes are object-oriented and complex. At no point did the company verify or validate what they were buying into, either as a concept of the component products.  Worse, the consulting company that &quot;sold&quot; it did not have any design proofs which could be verified and validated, nor did the consulting company or the global 50 company develop any structured acceptance testing.  Net result:  there is a large company that is betting the security of its internal and external applications on an unverified and unvalidated security scheme.  The information in this book would have given both parties a structured approach with which to ensure that what looks good on paper actually works when you implement the design, especially with products that bring with them their own set of flaws. I cited this true story to underscore the value of V&amp;V and to show how often it is not used for mission-critical systems.<br />The coverage of complex system types and development approaches in this book is must reading by anyone in QA, especially if QA is only performing pre-production testing.  V&amp;V is a necessary stage in the development (or procurement) process to ensure that what is eventually going into production conforms to what was specified.  If your organization does not perform V&amp;V then this book is all the more important, and will give you the processes and approaches to integrate it into your QA organization.

This book fails to prove its contention that FDR knowingly and specifically set the fleet at Pearl Harbor up for destruction. <br />Stinnett claims a memorandum from intelligence officer Arthur McCollum--a mere lieutenant commander--was the genesis of a policy of provocation by FDR against Japan.  However, when read, it becomes apparent the actions recommended in paragraph 9 are normal military, political and economic contingencies leveled against aggressive nations, not a plan of provocation.<br />It is McCollum's paragraph 10 statements that surprise.  &quot;If by these means Japan can be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better.  At all events we must be fully prepared to accept the threat of war.&quot;  If one reads the first sentence and discards the second, it sounds quite damning.  Taken together and in the context of the previous five pages, it becomes apparent McCollum feels even the least action is likely to provoke war and if Japan makes the first move, the US can get on with the inevitable business at hand.  This makes the excerpted eight actions much less a provocation and much more a measured and prudent response to impending war.<br />Besides misconstruing McCollum's intent and influence, Stinnett incorrectly states that all eight proposed actions were executed and that they originated with McCollum.  However, proposals to use British and Dutch naval bases predated McCollum's October 1940 memo, having been promulgated in War Plan Rainbow Two of September 1939.  They were never carried out.  The &quot;Base F&quot; Stinnett refers to was an Army--not Navy--project, and consisted only of lengthening Rabaul's runway to permit Trans-Pacific ferry flights of B-17s to the Philippines.  The U.S. Fleet was held in Hawaiian waters from May 1940, and the Dutch were refusing Japanese demands for oil even as the memo made its way up the chain of command in Washington D.C..  Clearly, McCollum did not originate these ideas.<br />Stinnett also attempts to claim two cruisers (one heavy and one light) normally assigned to the Asiatic Fleet, and one light cruiser passing through as a convoy escort to the Philippines constitute fulfillment of McCollum's proposal to send a division (typically 4 ships) of (specifically) heavy cruisers to reinforce the Asiatic Fleet.  This proposal was indisputably not acted on.<br />Stinnett states that provocative &quot;pop-up&quot; cruises by U.S. cruisers were carried out, even into the mouth of Japan's Inland Sea.  But the log entries Stinnett cites reveal both logged cruises were in U.S. controlled waters along the route to Australia.  As for the supposed foray to the Inland Sea's mouth, there are no log entries, only unverified claims of a Japanese hydrophone contact in that busy waterway repeated to and by the U.S. ambassador.<br />Stinnett's work is written from the assumption that his thesis is true, not from clear supporting evidence indicating it is true. He repeatedly fails to conclusively establish a trail of evidence to the necessary decision-makers, much less FDR. He fails to synchronize time lines or clarify chains of evidence and action (or inaction), and his technical knowledge is rudimentary.  <br />Stinnett also never provides adequate information to check claims of radio direction finding &quot;fixes&quot; establishing the presence of Japanese carriers in the North Pacific.  He only gives one exact bearing in the entire book, when it requires three to &quot;fix&quot; each intercepted signal to a geographic location.  The track chart provided is a reconstruction from memory and could thus be a complete fabrication.  Nor do the bearings surface in end notes.  If this crucial information exists, it's squirreled away with Stinnett's papers in an archive and withheld from the reader.  Why?   The intercepted transmissions supposedly originated from Nagumo's carrier force during its approach to Pearl Harbor.  However, the Japanese say the ships sailed with their transmitters deliberately disabled.  Stinnett produces no Japanese witness to dispute this.  Nor does he quote the signals or give dates and times for their transmission and receipt.  He gives total numbers of intercepted transmissions from Nagumo during the period of 15 November 1941 to 8 December 1941.  As this includes the 10 days prior to the carrier force's departure and imposition of radio silence, one is forced to wonder if there actually were any transmissions between 25 November and 7 December--the only dates which would establish the striking force's track.<br />Stinnett transparently bridges logical and evidentiary gaps with assumption and sloppily relies on the verbal recollections of positively discredited sources.  Worse, his end notes display a consistent and disturbing pattern.  Virtually every paragraph which raises a contention, allegation, charge of treason or piece of new evidence bears an end note in the seemingly appropriate place. But referencing the end note too often produces unrelated material, trivia, or original context that flies in the face of Stinnett's theory. <br />The suspicious pattern of end-noting severely damages Stinnett's credibility, as does his &quot;I've got a secret&quot; handling of his &quot;discoveries&quot; and his failure to quote them. The general aire of disingenuousness is completed by his claim that his host of traitors are patriots and the ends of their alleged actions justified the means.  Yet his ostensible purpose is to bring out the truth for aggrieved survivors of Pearl Harbor casualties.  Say what? <br />One is led to conclude this contradiction exists to shield the author from the (quite appropriate) legal wrath of the families of the men he claims committed treason in a work that is only remotely scholarly and too thoroughly sensationalistic speculation. <br />&quot;Day of Deceit&quot; is not enlightening, not proof, and not reliable. Read it with extreme caution and careful attention to what is not said, what is said vaguely, what is deceptively cited, what is not shared, and what can be explained more readily by a better mundane explanation.	2001-05-03

I'd also like to add that this book is dangerous. Can you imagine finding it funny that a friend or relative was killed? But this willingness to laugh at the misfortune of others, however insensitive that is, is not the main reason this book is dangerous. The danger lies in the pseudo-science behind the &quot;removing themselves from our gene pool&quot; nonsense. At one point, the author talks about a Sleepy Smoker Gene, referring to people who die after falling asleep next to their lit cigaratte. Does she honestly believe that such deaths improve our gene pool? This is the problem with all these stories. Darwinism has nothing to do with any of this! (If you have any doubt, read The Origin of Species, which talks about how it takes thousands of years, at least, for species of plants and animals to vary. Darwin never uses short-term human behavior to back up his theory.) However, a certain regime that rose to power in 1930s Germany did believe in the pack of idiocies known as 'Social Darwinism.' They also were greatly entertained by human death. I am certainly not putting the author in this camp, as she seems to be writing with a sense of black humor, not cruelty. But unfortunately, she is using pseudo-science to advance a very dangerous idea. Please pause to think about this for at least 24 hours if you intend to buy this book.	2001-04-23

Education is no exception.  The dysfunctional result from public schools appears more a consequence of politicized bureaucracy and an either indifferent or confused citizenry than from lack of resources.  (suggested reading:  _In_Pursuit_ by Charles Murray or _Inside_American_Education by Thomas Sowell.)  <br />As tools, computers remain cranky if useful devices -- an observation made from running Fortran code in highschool and college since the mid-1970s on Univac, CDC, PDP, SGI, HP on a plethora of operating systems.  The code gets fancier, and memory faster to access, but it's no panacea.  The medium is too narrow for anything but task-specific operations, and very frustrating as a learning portal, irrespective of baud rate.  <br />Dr Stoll's conversational style perhaps fills the pages more than necessary, but his critics are unable to refute his arguments against the superficial and unverified content of the Internet debases research or the distracting nature of visual graphics advertised to facilitate learning or the wretched quality of current software development and computer ergonomics or the expensive maintenance of equipment that's obsolete when manufactured, never mind installed.  <br />The hype from electronics promoters neglects to mention the advantages of durable media -- primarily books (with text).  This failing is evident even in scholarly studies, such as _Integrating_Information_Technology_in_Education_ that exhorts yet more electrons knocked from their p-orbital shells to placate the god &quot;nolij&quot; but no understanding or mastery that comes from self-discipline and investigative study.  _High_Tech_Heretic_ serves as an appropriate counterweight to this latest and expensive fad.	2001-04-19

Science is limited by its methods of experience and observation.  By themselves, these methods will never undermine God because they are incapable of reaching to and understanding the first cause of the cosmos; nor will they ever. But even Aquinas knew that. The main point of the book is that modern scientific revelation of God is consistent with His revelation in scripture, and their combined victory over the falsities of tradition. The book fails, however, when it assumes that since ultimate reality is unknowable beyond revelation that, therefore, the author's view of reality by default (sola scriptura/fundamentalism) is the only reality left to be known. Just because the Bible exists does not, in itself, constitute proof that it is true. Clearly, the truth of anything can only be determined by an appeal to something outside the thing itself. \\"The Christian should believe the Bible because it is true...\\" but scientific method alone is not enough to vindicate the entire Bible. One needs something else. Faith yes, but how deep is the faith of a believer if it would succumb to unverified myth?  The author sites the Reformation as a victory of scientific method over tradition, but, in making experience the litmus test for truth, the Reformation also opened the flood gates for the `modern'. Unencumbered by tradition, the `modern' can rationalize any reality he wants to experience. The Bible is not unlike any other historic document in the sense that, if it is true, it lives by virtue of a tradition deriving from an actual event. The veracity of any document is only as good as the strength of the tradition of the observations that produced the document. Undermining that tradition doesn't help make it true. The Bible was derived out of tradition and it is with respect for that tradition, which this book has little use for, that it can only be known and verified as true.	2001-02-27

I was looking forward to a good explanation of using XML with Flash 5. Like all XML users the first thing I did was to verify the XML document in Emberton's project. It would not verify. I found a typo in the DTD, fixed the typo, and then attempted to verify it with the repaired DTD. Still no luck. Next, I went through the ActionScript code, and it seemed to be all right, but no one in their right mind could trust script using unverified XML documents. The explanation of how the process works is unclear, and if anyone thinks that providing a screen shot of the ActionScript with purple comments is an explanation, I can tell you unequivocally that it is not. I passed to the next XML example in the book by John Lenker.<br />Lenker must have held his breath when he prepared this example, hoping against hope that no one who had a clue about XML would read it. First, after a windy and uninformed &quot;discussion&quot; of how XML is formed, the author conveniently forgot to add a DTD section or a schema. Did the XML verify? Of course not! Then the kludge he put together as an &quot;example&quot; was similar to what Chris Smith did in his Flash/XML tutorial available free at Flashkit. However, Chris Smith's XML verified!<br />Lenker used a similar trick as Smith did in setting up his XML, but not quite as good. Instead of using &quot;lastChild&quot; to identify the root node of the XML document (as did Emberton), he used &quot;.firstChild.&quot; That's fine, but to use that code, he had to keep his first two tags on the first line &lt;?xml version...?&gt;&lt;TopStories&gt;. By doing do, he effectively knocks out a tag for the DTD or schema. This is not good advice for people who are writing Flash for clients! It will crash and burn, and you've just made someone who read this kludge look like an idiot.<br />No matter how lofty Lenker makes his pronouncements, he did not do his homework, and anyone who takes his stuff seriously is going to be burned. Go back and read XML: A Primer by St. Laurent (really) to get an idea of what XML is meant to be. I don't know where you're going to find a good explanation of how to use XML with Flash. Try Chris Smith's online tutorial at Flashkit. At least his XML document verifies.and anyone who takes his stuff seriously is going to be burned.

Books	1	4	16	N	N	matlock again has no case for his claims	This book cannot be taken seriously.  Matlock claims that all religions, and especially Judaism, derive from early 'objectivist' Hinduism ('Yishvara'), which he regards as a nature religion involving reincarnation and seven basic rules of conduct.  To this end he revises the history of Hinduism and other religions and makes highly dubious claims about the mindsets of modern believers.  He regards most current forms of Hinduism as 'Aryanist' and 'subjectivist' distortions.  In some passages he actually proclaims that all people - even professed atheists - are automatically 'members' of Yishvara.<br />Matlock supports his basic claims by uncritically citing a mixture of ancient pseudo-historical and religious texts (read literally or metaphorically, as it suits him) and recent fringe Indian or pro-Hindu thinkers.  In many cases he simply makes unsupported assertions.<br />A prominent feature of the book involves 18th-Century-style philology, often relying on very loose similarities indeed.  Matlock tries to argue that many words in a range of languages come from Sanskrit or Kashmiri (he thinks that Kashmir had important early contact with Judaism), that everyone once spoke Sanskrit, that the Munda languages of India are an important source for German, etc, etc.  But most of his alleged cognates - invented by him or taken from unreliable Indian sources - are ludicrously wrong or (where less is known about the etymology) very implausible.<br />On non-linguistic fronts, Matlock develops a complex quasi-occult philosophy based on Hindu notions extended to cover St Patrick's Ireland, Old Testament Israel and the contemporary USA.  He also gives an idiosyncratic account of the relation between faith (good) and belief (bad) - although he admits that he himself does not follow this in his book.  He identifies his own approach as 'scientific' and 'empirical', and redefines the notions of science and rationality so as to exclude skepticism which rejects the paranormal.  His own canon of empiricism involves nothing stronger than the agreement of more than 'a few' witnesses, and often only his own subjective or unverified experiences and impressions.  Matlock makes various attempts to appear intellectually respectable, eg by criticising 'Outer Space cultists', but his own use of evidence/argumentation is no better than that of von Daniken and such, and he even accepts Atlantis as real.<br />I cannot recommend that readers buy this book.  It will only annoy the well-informed and confuse newcomers to the field.is own canon of empiricism involves nothing stronger than the agreement of more than 'a few' witnesses, and often only his own subjective or unverified experiences and impressions.

I heard the author read an excerpt at the book's launch party, and I was hooked. The premise had quite an attention-getter (a dying man sends a coded message even as he sees his death approaching) and I loved the author's word-play.<br />The author tells his story in such a captivating fashion that, when the six-legged aligators start speaking telepathically with our heroes, I totally bought it. My disbelief was willfully suspended.<br />However, while the author could make me believe that a gator could talk and quote the Bible and such, he couldn't make me believe that a woman who knows people are out to kill her drinks from a bottle of wine that she finds at her doorstep simply because she thinks she knows who left it there for her. Similarly random behavior from the main characters (the board of directors of a major corporation voting in a new CEO on the basis of one unverified claim by one conflict-of-interest lawyer -- this is the action upon which the entire novel hangs, and I didn't buy it for a second) poke holes that not even a scripture-quoting gator can ignore. <br />This is an interesting case of good language but not-so-good writing. Jeffrey gets many bonus points for writing a first novel that's readable and even gripping, but loses some points for the believability of his human characters. I like the world he's created and the native inhabitants with which it is peopled. I'd be interested in returning to Rozner's World, should there ever be a sequel, but only if the human tour guides are a little more natural.	2000-12-12

Some of the presentations are classics -- those of Horne, Mantik, and Palamara, for example.  Many areas are covered with considerable depth and intelligence.  One area, however, remains a mystery -- what really happened to the Presidential Limousine after the assassination?<br />For some reason, there is a dearth of limo information in this book, other than an unverified account of a mystery lone witness that the author calls a &quot;Man from the Ford Motor Company&quot; but who is, in truth, &quot;The Man from the Rouge&quot;.  This apocryphal story, that takes places outside of the critical timeline of the limousine, does little to further our knowledge of what actually happened, why, and by whom.  Instead, it functions as little more than a red herring -- we know nothing more after finishing the limo chapter than we did when we started.  If there were to be any agenda, it would be to draw responsibility away from the Secret Service and place it with the Ford Motor Company.  <br />Ironically, both the &quot;Smoking Gun&quot; chapter and the otherwise valuable &quot;Timeline&quot; chapter further the mystery -- the &quot;Smoking Gun&quot; chapter contains a reference to the Man From the Rouge's Story that is contradicted by all known information -- namely that 100x was 'stripped to metal' by 11/25/63.  And the Timeline, which gives considerable information about the limo prior to the assassination, gives almost no information subsequent to it; so we are left with the impression that the 8,000 pound SS-100-X sat in a time warp for three days, at which time it was then, magically, beamed to the Rouge!  <br />However, if and when you start asking questions about what really happened to 100X and are not finding answers in MIDP,there is a great deal of information available.  You might consider starting with my website on the JFK Assassination Presidential Limousine SS-100-X at [...]<br />Pamela McElwain-Brown	2000-11-22
US	50582847	R1TXGQNH6JIYLK	0961161442	596542449	Taj Mahal: The True Story	Books	5	56	62	N	N	A very good original research work on the Taj Mahal	P. N. Oak expounds an intriguing version of the Taj Mahal's origins in this book. He strongly refutes the traditionally accepted belief that the monument was constructed by 17th century Mughal emperor Shah Jehan as a mausoleum to his deceased wife Mumtaz Mahal, by attempting to prove that it was in fact a 12th century temple-palace seized from Raja Jaisingh of Jaipur and converted to accommodate Mumtaz's tomb.  Mr Oak forcefully argues his case on several fronts, his first point being that the only original source of  the claim for the Taj Mahal to be Shah Jehan's creation is an inaccurate and misinterpreted journal written by 17th century French jewel merchant and sometime India traveller, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, and that all other subsequent accounts were either based on Tavernier's unverified statements or were sycophantic additions after Shah Jehan's time. Mr Oak quotes firstly from Mullah Abdul Hamid Lahori, Shah Jehan's own official chronicler, that Mumtaz's body was laid to rest in a &quot;lofty sky-high palace with a majestic dome&quot; procured from Raja Jaisingh. He further quotes from the journals of Tamerlane (1336-1405) and Babur (1483-1530) to show that this palace pre-dates Shah Jehan and also points to the notable absence of any claim by Shah Jehan himself for its construction. He particularly refutes Tavernier's claim of having seen the beginning and end of the entire construction work being carried out during his sojourn at Agra by pointing out the enormous discrepancies between the three periods during which Tavernier stayed at Agra, between 1641 and 1663, and the period over which it is clamed to have been constructed (1631-1653). He also disputes the latter part of the presumed construction period as being implausible as they coincide with Shah Jehan's incarceration, according to all accounts, and he conjectures that what Tavernier saw was actually the work to reconvert it to a mausoleum and not the original construction itself, and advances convincing details on construction costs and  labour requirements to support his theory. Mr Oak further ridicules the widely conflicting other existing accounts, which appear to differ on everything from the year of Mumtaz's death to the time and cost spent in building the Taj Mahal.  His second point is etymological. Mumtaz's real name was Arjumand Banu Begum, and she was conferred the honorific title Mumtaz-ul-Zamani by her father-in-law Jehangir, but never Mumtaz Mahal, and he contends that she acquired the addition &quot;Mahal&quot; posthumously by virtue of being entombed in a palace, and that on the contrary it was not the monument which acquired her name, as latter-day historians would have us believe. He points out that the term &quot;Mahal&quot; is exclusively used in India, is not of Arabic or Persian origin therefore not of the Mughal period, and contends that it is instead of Sanskrit origin. One can easily identify &quot;Mahal&quot; as a contraction of  the Sanskrit &quot;Mahalaya&quot; or &quot;Maha-alaya&quot; meaning &quot;Grand Residence&quot; and when &quot;Taj  or Tej&quot; meaning a crown is the qualifying adjective, the term takes on a whole new meaning, i.e. Grand Residence of the Crown, or Grand Royal Palace. &quot;Tejas&quot; is also the Sanskrit term for &quot;resplendence&quot; and &quot;Teja Mahalaya&quot; also means &quot;Resplendent Shrine&quot;. The latter contentions would seem to be borne out by the immensity and opulence of the Taj Mahal and its environs, which are more consistent with the structure of a palace complex than that of a mausoleum and Mr Oak elaborates sufficiently on this point. The author also supports his assertions to the Taj Mahal's pre-Shah Jehan Hindu origins with a wealth of corroborative detail, from the &quot;Trishul&quot; present on its dome to specific details on its decor. He is also able to relate several of the terms in current use to Sanskrit origins. It is a pity though, that relevant photographs are not also included in his book..  Mr Oak's reasoning is methodical and his method of drawing conclusions is reminescent of the incisive and logical cross-examination methods of the courtroom. His arguments up to this point can however be considered to be circumstantial. His continual harping on Mughal tyranny and perfidy also detract from his otherwise brilliant analysis, and constitute a digression from the central point, i.e. who built the Taj Mahal. For instance the negative character traits of Shah Jehan and Mumtaz Mahal and their incongruency with the building of a monument of love from one to the other, while being paradoxical, are not necessarily proofs of  Shah Jehan's not building the Taj Mahal.  It is therefore highly commendable to find that Mr Oak has supplemented his excellent literary research with scientific methods. Radiocarbon dating was performed on some door samples taken from the Taj Mahal by Prof Marvin Mills of  the Pratt Institute Archaeological History Department, New York, who with Dr. Evan Williams of the Brooklyn College radiocarbon laboratory, thereby determined that the monument pre-dates Shah Jehan by at least three centuries. Prof Mills has already presented his findings at an annual meeting of the Archaeological Society and it might be interesting to include a reference of one of his relevant publications, in this already well-referenced book. Archaeometric methods are indubitably of great value in determining the true ages of buildings like the Taj Mahal and the fact of their inclusion considerably adds to the strength of Mr Oak's theory.  Radiocarbon dating is based on the measurement of the constant decay of C-14 radioactivity in organic materials and is a relatively well-established technique, limited however to materials such as wood and fibres. Thermoluminescence is another recent technique applicable among others, to pottery sherds, baked brick and sediments and is also fairly precise for dates up to the last 3000 years, but its application requires careful sampling which is not easily handled by the non-specialist. Other relevant absolute radioactive dating techniques are the relatively new Optically Stimulated Luminescence method and Uranium-Thorium or Potassium-Argon dosage methods. Any or several of these techniques, properly applied to the study of the Taj Mahal, would unambiguously reveal her true age. It would indeed be in the interest of science, history and posterity, to have a complete study undertaken by competent scientists. The famous Shroud of Turin was proved by C-14 dating to be a medieval era fabrication instead of its acclaimed status as the Shroud which wrapped the body of the Christ. Similarly, scientific dating is the only honest, truly objective means of  determining when the Taj Mahal was first built, if and when alterations were carried out, and to what extent. The Taj Mahal complex is also a rich archaeological treasure house that needs to be explored to better understand Indian history and to put all the various myths of whatever origin, to rest. This has nothing to do with belittling the achievements of one community or another. For all we know every one of the stories surrounding the Taj Mahal could be a myth and the truth be elsewhere. This book is an excellent treatise on the Taj Mahal and its origins. In spite of the author's obvious prejudices, it is on the whole, objective, excellently researched, well-referenced and logically presented, and should prove to be a valuable aid to all persons who are interested in obtaining an honest perspective of Indian history.	2000-10-26
US	52767127	RG0GGKOH8NL8E	0521640180	280807786	Genius Explained	Books	1	8	29	N	Y	Scientistic psychobabble	The project of Michael J.A. Howe's 1999 Genius Explained is an extremely worthy one: to explicate the origins and characteristics of that special class of persons commonly denoted genius through the significance of their intellectual achievements and the lasting impression which they make on our lives and civilisation. Unfortunately, in this aggregation of logical non sequiturs, Howe brings us no closer to an understanding of the nature of genius. Howe's methodology is examined in the introduction, in which he asserts that rather than having to rely on magical or miraculous explanations for genius, we can see the explication of the phenomenon of genius as a problem which can be solved. Specifically, the solution to explaining the seemingly astonishing capabilities of some people is directly attributable to circumstances which nurtured them (home environments, learning opportunities, etc). He goes on to point out that through extraordinary diligence and application over a period of years, generally though not exclusively in the formative years of their early childhoods, these geniuses became exceptionally proficient in their areas of study. Due to this, Howe suggests, geniuses need not be born but can be readily explained as products of a certain set of environmental factors. His thesis further suggests that an exploration of the well-documented childhood of certain geniuses will reveal that they did indeed enter into protracted periods of training before contributing in the ways which would later mark them as geniuses, rather than emerging as full armed intellectual giants. Chapters 2-5 examine the childhoods of Charles Darwin, George Stephenson and Michael Faraday. Chapters 5 and 6 broadly explore the phenomenon of the child prodigy. Chapter 7 leaves the world of scientist and shows that the Bront? children and Mary Evans experienced similar and lengthy periods of experimentation with fiction as children before 'arriving' at their first major novels, many of which contain threads of thought from their juvenilia. Chapter 8 examines the person of the inventor and Chapter 9 casts an eye over the idea that talent is inborn. The theme of scientific 'explanation' is a heavy and destructive one in this book and at no time does Howe countenance any other explanation of genius than a 'scientific' one. Howe naively relies on the limited conception that 'science explains everything'. A passage in the introduction reveals how perilous this position is: Howe offers it is more reasonable to believe the skilled conjurors who can imitate his feats rather than Uri Geller's explanation that he uses his mind to bend spoons. This is of course the more reasonable explanation if you believe the pat explanations of scientific 'observation'; but I do not, as a matter of course, happen to believe them myself and nor do I necessarily suppose that Geller's explanation is invalidated because of the existence of the scientific explanation. It would take more that this flimsy argument to show that. The scientific explanation only shows that the action is replicable by means other than the powers of one's mind. A far more serious problem besets Howe's project: nowhere does he explain what a genius is or even what it might be, problems that might have been addressed had he investigated the existing philosophical standpoints on this issue. I for one do not believe in the concept of human genius (although I do not rule out divine genius) and neither do I believe that any of Darwin, Mozart, Faraday, Elliott, Stephenson, or any of the other examined in this book are geniuses. I further think that all Howe does is to demonstrate how facile or capable (a topic never canvassed by Howe) certain individuals were in certain areas of expertise: are human calculators like George Bidder geniuses for being able to multiply six-digit numbers rapidly; or is Mozart a genius for being able to notate the incredibly repetitive Allegri Miserere, an unverified achievement? The suggestion is offensive. A genius, if it existed, would simultaneously be the most excellent in all fields of endeavour; the suggestions offered by Howe merely touch genius or reflect a fraction of its total. Richard Burton's considerable achievements in several fields are dismissed early in the book for being so diffuse as not to attract the title of genius, and yet as far as I am concerned, Burton is the most genius-like case offered in this book. With a true genius, there would be no question of facility. A genius would not be good at any thing, but merely unsurpassed in all things. All variations of this all-encompassing position merely indicate varying levels of facility. Finally, a word on the historical perspective which dominates this book. I see genius as a outgrowth of the late eighteenth century which received considerable exposure particularly in musical circles in the nineteenth century and which unfortunately continues to plague us today. Howe's book is firmly in the thrall of nineteenth century polemics. It is not surprising that he must rely on nineteenth century accounts of the childhoods of his heroes; earlier centuries did not seem to credit childhood with the significance we are now accustomed to giving it. His claim that Bach and Handel were regarded as prodigies is anachronistic and unsupportable to a large extent. Tales of Handel's amazing the court of Saxe-Weissenfels with his organ playing date from Mainwaring's attempts after the composer's death to canonize him and stand firmly in the nascent tradition of the genius. Darwin, Stephenson and Faraday's contemporary biographies stand either in the tradition of the hagiography or the self-improvement story (this is the age that produced The Improvement of the Mind, after all). Everything in this book is necessarily read backwards. A history suggests nothing of itself: we suggest to it. Biography in fact may or may not show something with regard to facility in a certain area, but if offers nothing in terms of being a genius. A disappointing book.

Covers the collective history of France, the German kingdoms,  Britain, Spain, Syria, and Italy.<br />Although the author points out that it  is a history of &quot;feudal&quot; Europe, he seems to focus on how much  wasn't feudal in the period.  It seems as if not one chapter goes by where  he doesn't mention the fact that the system in place was similar to  feudalism, but was in fact not it.<br />There is also constant mention of how  many of the facts of the period can go unverified, and how it is impossible  to determine the exact numbers in battles, seiges, etc.  I understand the  fact and it's valid, but brining it up every dozen pages does get a bit  old.<br />All in all, I think it was a good book for someone interested in a  general history of the different feudal and pseudo-feudal systems on Europe  during 700-1200AD.  It also contains interesting bits of military and  political history alongside it, which is very appealing.	2000-08-23

This review compares the Rough Guides Portugal (9th ed.) with Lonely Planet Portugal (2nd ed.).<br />We just returned from 2.5 weeks in Portugal. This was our  first trip to Portugal and we took and used extensively the Portugal books  from Lonely Planet and Rough Guide. We didn't visit the Algarve or  Alentejo, concentrating on Lisbon and north.<br />Both books were good, but  overall we preferred the Rough Guide book. It was better organized and more  up to date. It's writing was more incisive, lively, and witty.<br />Here are  some details as I saw them:<br />LP maps often covered a wider area and had  more detail than the RG maps, but they were in smaller type and often  difficult to read. On more than one occassion a cab driver pulled out his  spectacles to read the LP map.<br />Rough Guide had more up to date phone  numbers. LP did not have the up to date area codes (the leading 0 has been  changed to a 2). In addition, for many properties in the north they had a 5  digit phone number, when now they are all six. More disturbingly, they have  no update on their website for either the corrected area code or phone  numbers. In fact, there was no Portugal update to the guide at all. (I'm  not talking of the 'unverified travelers' reports.)<br />LP provided more  detailed information about the nitty-gritty details of traveling, e.g.,  money, trains, internet access, etc.<br />RG presented the towns around Aveiro  better. It was through it that we learned of Sao Jacinto, Torreira, and so  on. These were not indexed in LP. We didn't discover that LP had some  information on them until much later because it was more hidden in the  Aveiro section. Since we had already decided to not stay in Aveiro we  didn't think to look there. Although they were also in the Aveiro section  of RG, they had their own headings and were also indexed.<br />Similarly, RG  highlighted Belmonte in the mountains. This town was interesting in itself  and also in that it now holds one of Portugal's largest remaining Jewish  communities and its new synogogue. Jews had previously worshipped secretly  in a town house until 1974, now replaced by the new building. (I'm writing  this using a mouse pad I purchased at the Belmonte castle for $1.50 with  images of columns from the Mosteiro da Batalha!)<br />I also preferred RG's  treatment of Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela and of Parque Natural de  Montesinho.<br />We used several recommendations for restaurants and  accommodations from the books. Their batting averages were about the same:  good but not great. One African dance club listed in both books was now a  female stip place, as my wife discovered when seeing if the cab had taken  us to the right address. (I was waiting in the cab.) I felt they were  generally too generous in their evaluation of hotels and  restaurants.<br />Both books had several failings common to them and to other  guide books that we've used.<br />Nearly all the accommodations and  restaurants are in tourist areas. We were fortunate to stay in Lisbon in a  residential district. It was comforting to leave in the morning and not be  surrounded by hordes of fellow tourists. Similarly, we were the only  obvious tourists in the local restaurants, some of which were excellent.  Nor were we out in the sticks where a car was required. We were right off  the #28 tram line, recommended as the best tram to ride simply for riding  it in both books.<br />Several other times during the trip we stayed and ate  outside the centro area. In some cases a car would have been needed, but we  were only several km out of center. In any case, I think both books should  offer more 'out of centro' possibilities, especially when transportation is  available.<br />LP is out front in saying that its reviewers do not stay at  all the hotels or eat at all the restaurants they list.  I would like it if  the reviews would be initialized with the reviewers initials for the ones  that they personally tried.  This would also allow us to see and evaluate  each reviewer's tastes and standards as our trip progressed, not to mention  to see which places they really tried.  One LP writer (not an author of this book) in discussing  restaurants wrote: &quot;As one of those LP writers I can tell you that it  is not physically possible to eat even a 'little bit of a meal' in each of  those restaurants :-) What we all tend to do is eat at a broad  cross-section within the norms of natural eating times and visit the other  restaurants and talk to the owner or even the diners if it can be done  discretely. In the same vein we don't sleep at every hotel!&quot;<br />Talk to  the owners!  Now there's something for an unbiased, disinterested  evaluation! <br />Both books are oriented to train travelers, but they should  have some more info on driving too, which is not expensive. For example,  neither had a mileage chart between major cities and, more importantly,  neither had a chart of expected driving times. Using the 'N' roads which  look like major highways can take quite a bit of time because they are  mostly two lane roads, often twisty and hilly, and can have a lot of SLOW  truck traffic. You'd probably be better off driving on the back roads, both  for time and scenery, and for that small village, local feel. But you'd  never know it from these books. This complaint isn't restricted to just LP  and RG, of course.<br />In addition, both books were quite short on history,  culture and demographics. How religious are the Portuguese? (We were asked  on several occassions whether we were 'religioso'.) What is the median and  mean income of each of the areas (even of Portugal as a whole) and how does  this compare to the rest of western Europe. What are contemporary  middle-class Portuguese characteristics?<br />It wouldn't have taken more than  an additional 10 or 15 pages for such information, and it would have made  our trip more meaningful.<br />In sum, again, both guides were good withroom  for improvement, with our preferring the Rough Guide overall.	2000-08-23

This guy talks like he's just such an expert, when I would be very interested to see if he's really accomplished much along the lines of true alchemy.  Nevertheless, everyone has different inspirations, and I did get the sense that he offered some true inspirations, so the book doesn't seem to me totally useless. Unfortunately, a lot of it sounds like the typical new age drivel that one can read in a hundred thousand other books on occult or obscure subjects, and he repeats a lot of the same ideas over and over.  Since I am new, it did offer me some insight into the actual stages of alchemy; calcination and coagulation and such because it was basically about those stages in a psychological point of view. It did offer a unique insight into those stages I'm sure, but still seems like the ideas could have been condensed a bit. He talks a lot about his and other's (famous people such as william shatner, cat steven's, etc.) personal life experiences and relates them to the stages of alchemy, ufo's (which although I don't at all disregard such subjects exactly, a lot of ufo stuff is exagerrated and made up and/or delusional which makes me question his credibility a bit and stick him a little in with the fanatical, new age types), and just seems to have a lot of exposition in his writing style that I might have been happier without. The book has a very psychological/self-helpish aura about it rather than having the aura of a tome of wisdom. Another insight of the author's that ringed true to me somehow, though, was something he wrote about the one thing and a meditation one can do where the energy is often perceived like a color in the upper color spectrum... an ultraviolet light. That struck me as having truth because I've experienced something like it in my own meditation before I read the book. So, this book is not entirely useless. It's more like you have to weed out the substance from the clutter... starting to sound alchemical?  hehe Well, that's kind of ironic. The author also resorts to drugs at times it seems, which I've personally learnt are rather useless and delusional although such methods might seem like a way to attain real truth. I think the ultimate way to attain universal truths are by using one's natural abilities such as meditation and dreams and not such crutches as drugs because crutches like that often backfire in some way.  The problem with books about these kinds of subjects is that people talk like they know so much when really their knowledge is extremely superficial or unverified/delusional. I mean, how many of them can actually show me that they know anything? It seems to me a really useful book about alchemy might be very difficult to find. So this one has some stuff to offer. I guess it depends what you're looking for. Inside the book it gives the author's webpage, so if you want to know more, I suppose you could check it out. I haven't been there, but have been meaning to visit...	2000-07-25

I bought the book based on these glowing 5 star reviews.  At  first glance, I thought the book was complete phantasy and the authors must be just mad...yet curiously the book contains some down-to-earth examples.   For example:<br />&quot;[Tom Peters] initially made his name and fame in 1982  by preaching the virtue in 'pursuing excellence' and of MBWA -'...by  walking ...' A decade later he seemed to recant a bit, deciding the who  'excellence' theme was 'about wacky idea' and the companies he selected as  'excellent' were not that, after all. They just did some 'excellent' (does  that also mean 'wacky'?) things. [The text continues with 8 more  high-quality paragraphs of this Tom Peters argument/analysis...see  pp.24-25]  &quot;<br />Such depth is not consistent with a Snake Oil  business/psychology book.<br />Nevertheless, I must warn you that I cannot  fully endorse this &quot;vMEMES&quot; concept as it seems analogous to an  only-in-Alice-in-Wonderland &quot;cross-breading&quot;: 1/4 respected  Freud's psychodynamics, 1/4 Eastern Philosophy bio-energy fields (eg Chi  from Taoism), 1/4 semiotics, 1/4 molecular biology.<br />In fact, this  &quot;cross-breading&quot; is built into the very spelling of the word  &quot;Memes.&quot;  The book calls a &quot;vMEMES&quot; a  &quot;PsychoSocial DNA&quot;; &quot;MEMEs&quot; conveniently rhyming with  genes.  Also of note is &quot;MEMEs&quot; conceptual and etymological  similarity to the semiotic terms: morphemes and phonemes.  (From Schaum's  Outline on Psychology:  Morphemes--&quot;the smallest meaningful units of a  language&quot;; Phonemes--&quot;the basic sound or inflection components of  a spoken language&quot;) <br />Conclusion:  I haven't decided if the good and  insightful business examples are just facades covering over the sweetest  snake oil I've yet seen in a junk business/psychology textbook or if the  originator of Spiral Dynamics and the authors of this book have discovered  a useful, yet unverified, dynamic component of the human being's  bioelectric personality pattern (ie, the energy that moves around the  neurons of our brains' when we think).<br />About my Rating:  First, this book  is currently in my &quot;X-files&quot; category.  Second, it has no index.  So I've given it 2 stars out 5.  (I could change my mind in a few months if  these &quot;vMEMEs&quot; explain any phenomena I experience in the areas of  &quot;mastering values, leadership, or change.&quot;  I have yet  too...still why no index, professors Beck and Cowan?)	2000-07-22

Extremely readable and not couched in overly academic language,  the book is useful for anyone who needs solid, reasonable information on  the subject--the lay public, academics, the clergy, or police officers will  all benefit from reading this work and keeping an open mind.<br />Victor  follows the panic from a number of angles; religious, sociologic,  folkloric, and so on.  For each he presents a balanced case that seeks not  to  ridicule anyone who &quot;bought into&quot; the stories of widespread  Satanism, but simply to understand why they did so.  He also shows how some  people (psychologists, police, and so on) actually thrived on the notoriety  they achieved in their capacity as &quot;witch hunter&quot; and sought to  keep the panic alive in order to further their own agendas.<br />Excellent  reading, and a book that shows the danger of blindly believing rumors and  unverified conspiracy tales.	2000-07-15

Her biases are: she opposes adult men having sex with infants, she assumes that when a child screams and pushes her &quot;male partner&quot; away it  means that the child wants the man to stop, and she is repelled by  zoophilia (look it up).  I, too, was incredulous that Kinsey got away with  all of this pseudoscientific &quot;research&quot;, but he did.  Reisman  also exposes that his partner went on to found SIECUS, the Sex Information  and Education Council of the US, the leading consultant to school districts  on sex education today.  As far as Kinsey deserving a &quot;thoughtful and  unbiased&quot; reviewer - he has one in James Jones, his biographer.  But  the facts are facts, as Jones has verified.  Kinsey invented the &quot;10  %&quot; myth, so well known, and also was responsible for lightened  penalties on child sex offenders (he proved that kids &quot;ask for  it&quot;).  Kinsey's self-inflicted injuries speak volumes about his own  sex life, and there is not one single statement about Kinsey in Reisman's  book that is unverified by Kinsey or his associates.  I got his reports to  see what they were like, and Kinsey is his own best witness against  himself.  His use of psychopathic sex offenders as subjects guaranted that  he would get the data he wanted, and then he presented it as  &quot;normal&quot; male behavior.  If anyone wonders why sex education in  schools doesn't achieve stated goals, read this book, and you will come to  understand the problem. Thank you, Dr. Reisman - you are very courageous.	2000-05-20

US	51217825	R260WN3Z2XWILU	0761520570	746070341	The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire	Books	1	8	23	N	N	Pseudo history by a pseudo historian	This book falls largely into the category of \\"popular\\" history, meaning that it is geared for a mass audience.  History books of this type are a good thing, provided that they are accurate and based on fact.  _The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire_ is neither, however.  It is worth noting that Crozier worked for the secretive \\"Information Research Department\\" (IRD), a disinformation service tied to British Intelligence.  The task of this organization was to \\"spin\\" information gathered from the USSR and Eastern Europe into anti-Soviet propaganda, and pass the resulting half-truths and (in some cases) outright fabrications along to top Western journalists.<br />True to his roots, Crozier now applies the same methods of the IRD to writing this book.  Drawing selectively from Soviet archival data, he twists and embellishes his facts in such as way as to present the Soviet Union in the worst light possible.  Sometimes even this does not suffice, however, and his more preposterous claims are left unverified.  Interestingly, the IRD is also the same organization that spawned Robert Conquest, whose works are more academic than Crozier but are often equally guilty of skewering the facts, drawing irresponsible conclusions, and deceiving readers by blending established fact with undocumented fiction.  Whether in the guise of a historian or journalist, Crozier must be seen for what he is: a propagandist.<br />Politically slanted history is not uncommon and has is its place, but _The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire_ is just plain bad history, and has rightly been ignored by the mainstream press.  Most current history books sold on Amazon.com are usually accompanied by several editorial reviews by major publications.  This one is an exception, however, featuring only brief lines of praise from half-forgotten Cold Warriors, far-right figures in the media, and like-minded academics.<br />The first few pages of his introduction show that Crozier is still fighting the Cold War.  He desires to extract reparations from the ex-Communist states (a laughable suggestion since Western banks would have to loan them the money to do so), as well as put former officials of these countries on trial (also foolhardy since many of those men are now servants of democratically elected governments which have joined NATO).  He repeats these themes in his conclusion.  Crozier is clearly alarmed that the people of Eastern Europe have often chosen to elect former Communists back into power rather than continue to endure the corrupt and incompetent administrations of men like Poland's Lech Walesa and Lithuania's Vytautas Landsbergis, whose main accomplishments while in office were to create popular nostalgia for the socialist past.<br /><br />Crozier goes to such extremes that a comparison with the Stalinist line he despises so much is unavoidable.  Take, for example, his claim in a footnote on page 287 that most of the victims of the McCarthy witch-hunts \\"were proved later to have been, indeed, working for the Soviet side.\\"  This is an outrageous statement, similar to those made by apologists for Stalin who say that most of those imprisoned or executed in Stalin's \\"Great Purge\\" of 1936-38 were, in fact, guilty.  Crozier's description of the 1965 coup in Indonesia (pg 257) is not so much outrageous as it is chilling.  He does not deny the massacre of 300,000-500,000 (a very conservative estimate) people in an anti-Communist military takeover, but the only description given of the principal leader of this slaughter, General Suharto, is that he was \\"a man of cool nerve, caution, and natural political skill.\\"  Imagine the disgust a similar statement about Stalin's \\"cool nerves\\" or \\"natural political skill\\" would produce if used in connection with, for example, his decision to execute some 15,000 Poles in 1940.<br />The book is packed with similar outrages, such as this passage on page 139 describing British treatment of the largely pro-Communist Chinese minority inMalaysia's independence struggle, \\"[the British leadership] introduced drastic methods to resettle Chinese villagers...into New Villages protected by armed guards and barbed wire.\\"  I doubt that Heinrich Himmler himself could have described a concentration camp more eloquently.  That's one of the oddest things about Crozier.  He calmly notes many of the criminal acts performed by the Western powers and their Third World puppets in the name of anti-Communism, but does so with an unspoken nod of approval, as though only a Soviet agent would find such brutal methods objectionable.  Crozier's chilling indifference to Western brutality leaves the unsettling impression that in the \\"war\\" against Communism, no act of murder or repression can be ruled out.<br />This book is psuedo-history, useful only for giving the reader a glance at the surreal worldview of an anti-Communist zealot.  What can one say about an author who claims that a freedom fighter like Nelson Mandela was essentially just a front man for a Soviet-backed terrorist movement (pg 505)? Likewise, what can one say about those who would cheer the author of such nonsense? If, for whatever reason, you decide to read this book, do so only with the greatest skepticism.

By comparison, Freud's writing about dreams is lucid and engaging.<br /><br />However, the most off-putting thing in the book is the author's uncritical acceptance of dreams as psychic phenomena. To hear a grownup person at the turn of the twenty-first century -- a scientist with a PhD, no less -- spouting nonsense about \\"telepathic dreaming\\" and using dreams to predict the future is disheartening, to say the least. (He even cites Shirley MacLaine's idiocies about reincarnation as if they are to be taken seriously.)<br /><br />Although there might be some interesting and useful information in this book, the author's cumbersome language and spiritual beliefs that taint his scientific objectivity put me off completely.<br /><br />June 2002<br /><br />Imagine my surprise at finding myself personally attacked in a review of this book by someone who signs in only as \\"A reader from USA.\\" Sounds like a ringer, folks.<br /><br />I challenge the statement, \\"As for telepathic and precognitive dreaming, they are facts, not fictions, well documented and well studied.\\" Psychic claims have been well studied, but according to the documentation, no scientific study has ever validated the existence of any psychic phenomenon.<br /><br />\\"We ... have much to learn about ourselves ... from our dreams.\\" About our inner selves, that is. Dreams are subjective. They are neither receptors of magical visions of the future nor evidence of past lives. As to what we can learn from Mr. Van de Castle, accepting his unverified claims can only teach us how gullible we are.<br /><br />Van de Castle is an indefatigable researcher, but he's no more an \\"authority\\" on dreams than Erich von Daniken is on ancient history. It's not the accumulation of facts but the scientific validity of the conclusions based on those facts that makes one an authority. Despite much current disenchantment with Freudian analysis, Freud's \\"On the Interpretation of Dreams\\" is still the best writing on the subject.<br /><br />Another reviewer says \\"Contrary to the last review, I did not find this book difficult to read or understand.\\" I didn't say the book was either. I said it was academic, awkward, and cumbersome. I don't necessarily find such writing hard to read, but it's not much fun.<br /><br />January 2003<br /><br />Mine is undoubtedly the \\"one negative review\\" cited by another critic, who wrongly infers that I am \\"a Freudian.\\" All that can be gleaned from the above is that I am a rationalist who admires good writing.<br /><br />Agree or disagree with Freud, his propositions have a rational basis. The analogy of believing the Earth to be the center of the universe applies more properly to Van de Castle's views on psychic phenomena and reincarnation than to Freud's attempts to understand dreams within the framework of modern science.<br /><br />Freud's pioneering efforts inspired others to seek greater understanding of human motivation and behavior. Van de Castle's mysticism puts us back in the Dark Ages.<br /><br />Amazon.com's listing of Freud's \\"Interpretation of Dreams\\" contains a number of thoughtful reviews and critiques.

After reading the great book reviews of this book, I actually expected it to be better than it was.  I ought to shoot a hole with a gun through this book for not explaining ritual.  She gives examples of rituals, yet doesn't  perform how to explain them and in simple terms....her methods of ritual  are odd.  I never cast a circle with white paint or chalk.  It's not a bad  idea, but a beginner reading this book wont know the importance that  feeling and energy has when casting a circle.  Her introduction and 1st  chapter (History) is excellent.  Also, her information on the Sabbats are  also excellent, but one should stop and think, she started the Sacred Wheel  of Wisdom school.  But, her Sabbat rituals are not the best (they appear in  chapter four: Pagan Rituals).  Who wrote these rituals?  Gerina?  Although  in each of the rituals, they speak of the reason one is celebrating, they  are lame, can get wordy, and some have, in a sense, ridiculous props.  For  better rituals read The Wiccan Path: A guide for the Solitary Practitioner  by Rae Beth.  Chapter Three on Tools and Symbolism is not bad, but Gerina  needs to realize that nothing is set in stone, not even her words, and one  does not need a ceremonial robe or sword just to practice Wicca.  Did this  author not have money and convenience in mind?  Don't get upset over the  inverted pentagram either.  Remember, Gerina, like most Wiccans, are past  the point of seeing any evil within the pentagram and when it's seen, it  means to us what we have been taught, the correct thing.   So, if she wants  or uses the inverted (horned god) pentagram, that's fine with me.  She  could have explained magick a little better, but it's a nice introduction.   It's nice that she explains charms, amulets, and talismans....but....Gerina  is exploring dangerous territory when she starts speaking about magick word  squares.  She speaks of even making a spirit appear before you.  She should  not make unverified (yet, maybe not to her) promises, especially not to  absolute curious individuals and beginners.  Why does she mention  parchment?  As in all her other books, what century does this woman live  in?  Back to magick word squares, an experienced Wiccan knows how magick  works, but can one explain how a magick word square works?  Chapter Eight  entitled the Witch's kitchen is very interesting, and I was very pleased to  find a recipe for Handfasting cake and also a recipe for old fashioned  Witch's soap, as well as a flying and love potion, all very interesting as  well as a variety of types of incenses.  All very interesting.  Her chapter  on Wortcunning is so-so.  Her section on folk names is interesting and  useful, but when she starts on all those lists (which, in a sense, can be  helpful) and correspondences, the chapters begin to get long and drawn out.   Luckilly, she kept her chapter on Pagan deities to a minimum, she goes on  for hours in some of her other books.  Her lists of herbs, as I said, can  be helpful, but like in all her other books, methods and types of  administration or using herbs in general is not discussed.  Moving on, she  does some nice research on her chapter on tree magick, but a beginner may  wonder why this section is included.  She includes some folkloric spells  and divination reguarding and containing trees.  Her chapter on dreams is  not bad, and I disagree with the book reviewer who said for better dream  information go to RavenWolf, that's not necessarily true.  RavenWolf  doesn't explain different types of dreams, for the most part, only her  opinions.  Like always though, Gerina Dunwich takes us on a trip through  her ancient grimoire reguarding dreams.  Notice, it seems, all her dream  divinations are reguarding love.  She repeats things from book to book.   She gives two spells reguarding dreams.  One includes fasting with water  for a whole day for best results.  I really did like her chapter on dream  magick.  The final chapter (a book with no conclusion) is on Pagan  periodicals, a chapter that could be seriously outdated.... This is a good  book, don't get me wrong, and it can answer a lot of questions about Wicca,  but Gerina really did leave a lot out, and personally I am not afraid of  mischievous ghosts, elves, and fairies like this author seems to be with  her neoclassical New England style of writing.... In closing, this book,  although will get a beginner started, may be better for a nonpractitioner,  but I could be wrong.  It would answer a lot of questions and hopefully  dispel fears of the unknown.	1999-10-09

Yet, Bodansky's web of global conspiracy hinges on untested assumptions and unverified claims  stitched together by an Islamic-phobia that belongs in a previous century.  Bodansky shows his analytical weakness by lumping together every so-called  Islamist from the Maghreb to Mindanao in a mythical anti-Western crusade.  Bodansky falls within a long line of so-called policy analysts who have  invented the clash of civilizations thesis by promoting fear and demonizing  the other. Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist, yet he is hardly the face nor  mastermind of a world wide Islamist militant movement. He is an extremist,  isolated by his theological and violent beliefs, with marginal support  among the mainstream Muslim intelligentsia, professional groups, and  working classes, dangerous to the West and the Muslim world equally.	1999-09-02

When I originally purchased and began to read Talbot's presentation, I was intrigued by the way he proposed to explain some of the mysterious or unexplained phenomena of the past and present through an honest inquiry. He  applied a blend of both scientific theory and speculations from traditional  mysticism to the table. He includes discussions of some of the stranger  aspects of quantum physics that have challenged modern physicists with  their counter-intuitiveness and introduces the concept of the HOLOGRAPH as  a possible model of reality. Yet he feels the need to combine these points  with paranormal or &quot;supernatural&quot; mysteries from the past, as  well as his own experiences. In the end, however, he clearly veers towards  his own assumptions and uncritically accepts much of the dubious  superstitions and supernatural claims of less enlightened historical times.  He does not actually present any real evidence for his argument or  hypothesis, but descends into personal anecdotes (i.e. unverified claims)  about his own bizzare &quot;experiences&quot;(hallucinations?). The book is  interesting up to a point, but quickly degenerates into yet another  &quot;New Age&quot; attempt to elevate magical-spiritual-supernatural  nonsense to the level of legitimate and testable science.

This is not one of them.  The recommendations from other authors (on the book sleeve) seem like professional quid pro quo, as the same authors are given as references inside. The book fails for  several reasons.  First the author lacks the in depth knowledge of her  subject matter, and is frank about that.  The interviews all take place  decades after the events, they lack  the kinds of vivid details that make  other books great. The biggest problem with the book is that it reads more  like a fictional account.  The witnesses present us with unverified first  hand accounts.  They are free to withhold more revealing details, or to  embellish their accounts.  Several of the accounts just don't ring true,  and one gets the impression that a story is being told.

At times the book represents little more than an expanded version of  &quot;Who Weekly&quot;.<br />Perhaps more exasperating is the underlying  disquiet that Pilger expresses about Australian society in general. Like  other former Australians (Germaine Greer etc) Pilger has become content to  sit comfortably at home in England critising a society in which he has not  truely participated for 20 years. No number of smiling photos in the  outback, or wistful stories of childhood in Bondi will disguise the  underlying fact that he is still stung by 60's Australian society, and  apparently believes that little has changed here since that time.<br />The  timely revelation of decades of abuse against indigenous Australians was  skillfully and appropriately composed, but much of the rest of the book is  grossly self indulgant	1999-01-12

The first of the three &quot;Calendars&quot; of Soviet Treaties, which covers the years 1917-1957, rosters the Soviet Union's verified international agreements with other nations by year, giving for each treaty its date, a descriptive title, sources and references, and, in many instances, an annotation.
