Even more than that, having personally been a Mike Warnke fan many years ago, I had noticed on my own that his stories do not line up. With that in mind, I sat down and sketched out many of the simple facts that do not add up. I encourage anyone with an interest in Mike Warnke to step past their own emotional responses and actually study Mike Warnke's words.<br /><br />For example, if you were to listen to all Mike Warnke's concert recordings and keep a journal of everything he claims, and then compare the notes from the individual recordings and the Satan Seller, you will quickly realize on your own that Mike's portrayal of his own life just is not possible. His story of his own life changes too greatly over time. Additionally, the timeline of events as Mike describes cannot be accomplished on a calendar. Although some errors can be attributed to the passage of time and the possibility that a fact or two can be misplaced, the staggering number of incongruities that occur in Mike's own words are just too many to be shrugged off. After amassing such list of apparent mistakes on your own as I have suggested, sit down and read this book. You will see that not only does your list make sense and Mike's life does not, but you will be able to fill in many of the causations and backgrounds for the inconsistencies.<br /><br />I find it amusing, however, that the people who are accusing the writers of this book of dishonesty are also stooping to name-calling, and at the same time degrading the book's authors and promoters as name-callers. That's like saying, \\"Stop calling me names, you pooh-pooh head!\\" I understand that there are a great number of people that loved Mike's public image in the past, and several people still do. This causes an emotional reaction to the truth, and that makes it almost impossible for some people to take. For example, most people have been around the Internet long enough at this point to have seen an Urban Legend or two. When you point out that someone has forwarded you an Urban Legend, there is an underlying realization by the sender that they have just been fooled. They become embarrassed, defensive, and sometimes deny the truth by trying to back up the story with allegations that the story was verified by other sources. There comes a time when you have to put aside your emotional reaction to a situation and just analyze the facts.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that one of the reviewers seems to base his assertion for Mike's innocence on a personal conversation that he had with Mike. Although I am not 100% sure, I feel that most people would be easily subdued by Mike if they spent an afternoon with him. That's part of Mike's recipe for success - his charisma is unmistakable. Like a skilled artist, Mike knows how to make you see \\"his\\" side of the story, regardless of any basis in fact.<br /><br />That being said, the accusation that Christians \\"shoot their wounded\\" is all-too-often true. If Mike had come forth and openly admitted that he had lied, asked forgiveness from those that he had offended, and the church still treated him as an outcast, then the church would be guilty of such a crime. But with Mike Warnke, the reverse is more the case. Mike has wronged a great number of people, and yet he still maintains his innocence and claims to be the victim. (The closest that Mike has come to admitting any wrong-doing on his part was to assert that he had exaggerated slightly.)<br /><br />From having studied human behavior, there is an explanation to Mike's actions. Mike's stories and defenses seem to put him more in the category of a Pathological Liar and not a Compulsive Liar. For those of you that have never met a Pathological Liar, they are interesting people to know. Compulsive Liars simply tell lies for personal gain or self-preservation. They are aware that they are lying, but they can justify their behavior patterns to themselves. (This behavior is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.) Pathological Liars, on the other hand, tell lies for a myriad of reasons, but believe their lies as deeply as we believe the truth. Therefore, they can defend their lies with a zeal that parallels the defense of truth. Having personally known a few Pathological Liars in my lifetime, it is frequently hard to distinguish their truths from their lies. Because of this predisposition to dishonesty, Pathological Liars often lose the trust of everyone around. And unless they make an attempt to regain trust, they may never be trusted again. Mike Warnke's conduct suggests that he is not concerned with regaining trust, because he continues to assert that he never lied, even when faced with insurmountable evidence to the contrary. Because of this, Mike's behavior can only be categorized as unrepentant.<br /><br />This leaves us with a few questions and answers:<br /><br />Should the church reject Mike Warnke? Absolutely not.<br />Should Mike Warnke be forgiven? Yes.<br />Should Mike Warnke repent? Yes.<br />If Mike does not repent, should he still be forgiven? Yes.<br /><br />But the most important question: If Mike does not repent, and we have forgiven him as the Bible instructs, should he still be trusted?<br /><br />That answer, I'm afraid, is NO.r is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.)

Though I certainly do not agree with everything Commander Rockwell wrote, many of his observations and conclusions, though dated by time, still appear to be valid even today.<br /><br />His concerns about the power and influence of organized and entrenched Zionism and the dangers implicit in this power and influence ring bitterly true after events such as 9/11 and the invasion of Afganistan and Iraq where American foreign policy has been increasingly hijacked by pro-Israel 'neocons'.  In addition, his warnings about the violence and degeneracy of African-American culture and behaviour can be verified by simply turning on your radio and listening to the savagery, sexuality and baseness of so-called 'rap' and 'hiphop' music as well as by examining the barbarity and sexual promiscuity still found in the inner cities of Detroit, Washington, Los Angeles and New York.<br /><br />The genius of Commander Rockwell, who gave his life for his cause and his people, is clearly evident in his warnings and prognostications for the America of the future.  Enlightened citizens should surely take them to heart.	2005-10-12

In conjunction with the British journalist and former Times correspondent J.O.P Bland, he had authored two best selling books about the Chinese Royal Court at the Forbidden City, Peking (now Beijing).  Backhouse, by the time of his death, had lived in China for nearly 40 years.  The high esteem in which he had been held by students and scholars of Chinese history collapsed upon publication of this book by Hugh Trevor-Roper (HTR).  Trevor-Roper of course is the esteemed British historian and author of the classic \\"The Last Days of Hitler\\".  The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" is the first full biography of one of history's greatest scam artists, Sir Edmund Backhouse.  The pinnacle of Backhouse's achievements, the publication of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" in 1910, was found to be based on a forgery, one of many forgeries as it transpires, perpetuated by Backhouse, the ramifications of which continue to this day. <br /> <br />I first read of Backhouse in Diana Preston's book \\"The Boxer Rebellion\\", (a modern account of the siege of the Peking legations in 1900 by the Chinese Boxers) and again in Sterling Seagrave's \\"Dragon Lady\\", a revisionist biography of Tzu His, the Dowager Empress.  Both authors are not charitable about Backhouse, and both give a potted biography of the man, particularly in Seagrave's book.  In fact, Seagrave is particularly scathing and rightly so.  As a direct consequence of Backhouse's forgery of a diary supposedly by a high Manchu court official, and subsequent book publications based upon the diary, popular history regards the Dowager Empress as an evil, scheming, and manipulative woman, who went as far as having her own son murdered to maintain her grip on the regency of China.   <br /> <br />The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" gives a much fuller account of the life of Backhouse, and fills in more detail about the numerous frauds that Backhouse tried pull off.  Not only was Bland as co-author of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" a victim (Bland believed until his death that the diary could not have been a forgery) of Backhouse's fraudulent activities, but also G. Morrison, the renown Times Correspondent.  Even Oxford University and the British Government were taken in as HTR gleefully relates.  It is amazing that Backhouse got away with what he did without the greater world being aware of it, but HTR shows the reader how he did so (Backhouse's victim's embarrassment was one reason).  In part, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a detective story as HTR pulls the threads of this tale together, sorts fact from the many fictions.  It is well written, and only in the final chapters does HTR delve into the literary pornography for which Backhouse is now famous for, and HTR does so with taste, sparing the reader the graphic details (Seagrave doesn't spare though).  Trevor-Roper relied on a number of sources, which in the main is the private correspondence of Bland and Morrison.  The author also had access to the archives of the Foreign Office and of one of Backhouse's former employers.  And of course, HTR uses Backhouse's own writings to point out historical contradictions and fabrications which can be verified with certainty.    <br /> <br />If there is a quibble with the book, it is that HTR doesn't dwell on the historical consequences of Backhouse's frauds and how it contributes to a long and widely held misconception of the final days of the Chinese Royal Court, the role which Tzu His played in it.  Many histories of China have relied on the writings of Backhouse as a historical source and reference, thus perpetuating the popular myth of the Dowager Empress as a ruthless leader of her people.  At times HTR is typically given to eloquent turns of phrase, making reading a little slow at times.  None the less, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a stirring read, and despite its age, should be viewed as a companion to the much more recent \\"Dragon Lady\\" by Sterling Seagrave to flesh out one of the main characters of early 20th century Peking. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Unfortunately his overly positive approach does not present an accurate view of the field. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis; to hear Rhine's account you'd think these were all proven. If a tested phenomenon has been reported positively twice, Rhine considers it verified, no matter how many negative studies have been done, no matter allegations of experimental weakness, data manipulation and subject and experimenter fraud.<br /><br />Not one of the phenomena Rhine discusses can be routinely verified under adequately controlled conditions to this day. If people could see hidden objects and influence events such as the roll of a die, Las Vegas would have been bankrupted long ago.<br /><br />Since Rhine's discussion of paranormal phenomena are so flawed, the later chapters on social, scientific and religious implications are worthless.<br /><br />If you are looking for Rhine's \\"Galileo wannabe\\" moment, it's on page 156 of the William Sloane version of the book.	2005-10-09

A revelation...	I can't say enough good things about this book...  I read it after doing a web search of various symptoms and realizing my best friend who I had recently started rooming with had BPD. Let me tell you, it was the epiphany to end all epiphanies - realizing that I was NOT imaging things, being overly sensitive, or going crazy and that there was an \\"answer\\".  This realization gave me a sense of peace I cannot begin to describe.  Waves of shock went through my body as I saw symptom after symptom listed; some of the case studies were almost verbatim accounts of the rage filled blow ups and bizarre behavior I experienced first hand.  The authors call this realization \\"the light bulb effect\\" (perfectly put, by the way). I was fortunate enough to be able to remove myself from the BPD environment shortly after realizing what was going on, so while I can't vouch for the usefullness of the tips the authors give on how to deal with/live with a BPD person, I nevertheless count this book among the most important I've read thus far in my life.  The authors break everything down in clear, concise, easy to understand terms and give very specific and realistic analogies and examples to illustrate their points.  \\"Gaslighting\\" was the term that spoke to me the most.  This is when the BPD's [inaccurate] reality is different from, if not the exact opposite of yours.  I'll give you my own horrific experience with this:  I asked my roommate a question, she guessed at the answer but didn't know for sure if she was correct.  So I emailed my mother the question and she verified my friend was right.  So I showed her the email from my mother, the whole point being \\"Look, you were right!\\"  Well somehow this triggered a 15 minute long screaming, yelling, belittling, venomous verbal tirade that ended with her screaming \\"And then you show me this letter from your mother to tell me I'm wrong!\\"  THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT I SAID!  I started yelling at her to look at the email to see that I was, as I said, showing her she was right and she refused to look at the paper, actually turned her head away so she wouldn't see the printed words.  For whatever reason, she NEEDED to feel I was trying to tell her she was wrong and therefore stupid.  This trait is summed up by the authors in one simple sentence: \\"Non BPDs base their feelings on the facts, while BPDs change the facts to fit their feelings\\".  It was worth the purchase price for this sentence alone!  If you suspect someone in your life has BPD, this is a must.  Even if you don't, it's still a fascinating read.  There is a place in heaven for these authors!!!	2005-10-08

Just a quick note to all the haters and doubters out there.  Don't judge before you have experienced.  When I first encountered Sylvia Browne in the late 1990's, I used to think exactly as some of the reviewers of her books and her detractors characterize her.  That is, as a useless and dangerous criminal charlatan.  But then, something amazing happened.  I got to actually be \\"read\\" by her at an event in Toronto at the Learning Annex.  In the span of a minute and a half, Sylvia (through spot-on and specific references to people I know or have known, experiences I have had or was in the midst of having at the time, etc.) proved to me that she was for real. <br /> <br />I am not talking about some John Roberts BS like, \\"I'm sensing someone by the name of G in the room.\\".  I'm talking specific names, dates, events, chronology, and the relation between them.  Then, after giving me a rundown of what was going on in my life at that time, she proceeded to tell me how everything was going to unfold in the next year.  Well, all I have to say is that she was right on the money on all counts.  Not only did what she said would happen happened, all of it occurred at exactly the order and time intervals she predicted.  I will not divulge the details because this had to do with private matters that, frankly, are nobody's business but my own (another thing, even though we were in a large hall with hundreds of people, Sylvia maintained professionalism by not embarrasing me with too private a reading).  Since then, I have had the priviledge of having 2 formal readings with her, each of which was just superb.   <br /> <br />There are those who say that she is not a serious scholar of the paranormal.  But, I ask you, how in the hell can anyone be a serious scholar of the paranormal?  By definition, the paranormal is fleeting, and subject to much interpretation from enumerable points of view.  Nothing can be isolated and verified.  None of it can be replicated.  Therefore, there is no scientific basis for inquiry, right?  What kind of sources can be sighted in such a course of study?  A book by someone who read a book by someone who read another book by someone who swears that a friend of a friend 30 years ago saw some freaky crap happening in the night's sky, huh?  Ridiculous. <br /> <br />So, if you're picking up this book and saying to yourself \\"Who does this person think they are?  They're going to tell me about life, about the paranormal, about my future?\\", just give it a try and see if you are not wholeheartedly convinced that Sylvia is the real thing.  You might just actually feel all of your skepticism just slipping away into the ether.	2005-10-08

From these studies the author developed unique insights. His perspective of the earth, time, and its place in space ... is a very fascinating reading experience. His hypothesis is based on connections he has made from ancient and modern astronomical and scientific discoveries. He noted one main distinguishing difference between ancient and modern man is the concept of time. Modern man is obsessed with a linear focus - seeming to view events and discoveries on the basis of evolution, going from the simpler to more complex level. Ancient cultures however, viewed time as cyclical, even the Old Testament speaks of a time and season for every purpose and event. The ancient Babylonians, the Egyptians who built the pyramids, the shamans of the Hopi Indians of North America, the Mayan Indians of Central America, and the oldest civilization in the world which existed in India - all had an obsession with time. They demonstrated this knowledge by tracking the stars in the heavens and leaving monuments which are often records of their discoveries. Noting the abundant scientific evidence for the cyclical nature of many biological, physiological, and chemical life processes ... the author noted that ancient people had recognized patterns and cycles of the stars and its causes. The author describes how modern scientists view the concept called \\"celestial motion of precession\\" and its causes. The author provides detailed explanations why his view supports what the ancient Arabic, Sumerian, Mithraic, and Vedic traditions hinted at ... that our sun is influenced by another star. This other star (or sun) could affect many aspects of life on earth through its orbital cycle, gravitational pull and magnetic energies. This other star could be the cause of the cyclical nature of many natural events from the ancient past, the modern present, and future life on earth.<br /><br />The author obviously loves his subject and does a phenomenal job of sharing his knowledge and deep insights. He has a wonderful grasp of the science of astronomy. He lucidly explains and describes difficult concepts and ideas on this subject. Each suspense filled chapter is an adventurous read which unfolds fascinating ancient scientific knowledge of astronomical observations comparing it to the modern scientific view. The author includes a very helpful glossary for complicated terms and unfamiliar concepts. He provides a wonderful bibliography referenced by footnotes in each chapter where supporting data and the ideas can be verified by any curious reader. There is a terrific appendix with eight sections which is an added bonus that includes otherwise difficult to obtain information. The author created the four tiered Galileo Awards each with a substantial monetary award attached, in order to challenge the scientific community to provide the scientific evidence required to prove once and for all ... the existence of the binary twin associated with our sun. I give 10 stars to this book as recommendation for anyone interested in ancient cultures, myths, and astronomy.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)ts from the ancient past, the modern present, and future life on earth.<br /><br />The author obviously loves his subject and does a phenomenal job of sharing his knowledge and deep insights.

It is noteworthy he shies away from including Judaism in his list of religions that are anathema.  This compromises his integrity in the name of political correctness.<br /> Nowhere does he account for the ultimate basis of morality and the legitimacy of judging one act as right and another as wrong.<br /> He attacks the design argument by a cursory assumption of the veracity of Darwinism.<br /> He ignores the fact of human sin and whether or not there is a solution for it and whether or not sin incurs judgment on the other side of the grave.<br /> He ignores the supernatural history and continuity of Christian revelation and its consummation in the Life, Death and Resurrection of Christ.<br /> He criticizes Christ's character on the basis of the latter's pronouncements on sin, death, judgment and hell.  If hell is real, Christ's adamant emotions on the subject are well warranted.  But, Russell simply presumes against these teachings.  He doesn't accomplish what he wishes by begging the question.  By His resurrection, Christ is in a better position to decide the question concerning the existence of hell.<br /> Unfortunately, great achievements in mathematical logic have proven, with Russell, that they are insufficient credentials for making a good theologian or a cogent apologist for the ungodly.<br /> Russell, like John Stuart Mill or Charles Darwin, possessed an impressive mind.  He was erudite in his professional career and a lucid and eloquent writer.  But he was stillborn in his criticism of Christianity.<br /> I think a pervasive Darwinist culture put the blinders on so that his horse could not take his carriage down the right path.  Had he been exposed to modern results of Creationist researchers, his Darwinism would have fallen apart and the rest of his criticisms with it.<br /> Fossilization has proven the catastrophic model of the biblical flood as against the uniformatarianism of Darwinism.  Unfossilized dinosaur bones, including their fresh blood, has refuted the speculations and circular reasoning of the great ages of the dinosaurs posited arbitrarily by evolutionists.  Paleontologist Mary Schweitzer's and others have verified this.  Folklore, linguistics and artwork across the globe testify to the flood, the coexistence of dinosaurs (aka dragons) with man and such biblical narrations as the tower of Babel.  Submerged civilizations such as off the coast of Cuba, Yamaguchi Japan, Lake Titicaca and so on confirms not only biblical accounts but a different geography and atmosphere of earth's past.<br /> Russell reckons the universe too unjust for God to exist.  But, he puts the cart before the horse.  It would be more unjust for there to be no God to punish the wicked who have perpetrated so much harm to other people.  And we know their number is plenty and their crimes horrific.  Even the notion of law has no meaning unless there is a lawgiver.  As a logician, familiar with the notions of sense and reference, Russell should know this .  The primitive Aristotelian logic of the Scholastics he criticizes didn't blind the scholastics to this fact, but Russell missed the point.<br /> The sophistries of the devil and human sin have proved more than a match for the intellectual acumen of Bertrand Russell.  Ironically, in his last days he embraced the Sermon on the Mount as a model of morality.	2005-10-07

The book is essentially an indexed, cross-referenced, best practices guide to building web pages that attract and keep customers. Or at least keep you from pissing them off. The authors have collected and summarized a great deal of HCI research (all listed in the resources section of the appendix) on web usability, so none of this stuff is made up--it's all based on time-proven, tested, and verified data about how people actually use the Internet (e.g., see Amazon, Yahoo!, Google, et. al.). A few of the patterns are no longer considered best practices, due to evolving standards (e.g., CSS) and increasing browser standards support.

Makes for a lot of information handy to store just about anywhere...<br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I found many formulas & shortcuts throughout the book. From Chapter 12 I plotted a 16 frequency (# of divisions making total # of triangles) icosahedron (the typical geodesic polyhedron shape) dome with 3880 chords or \\"struts\\". Even made them into arcs for a perfectly round sphere. Chapter 12 has \\"Using the Tables\\" with a simple symmetric triangle xyz-grid on a spreadsheet. Each chord calculated does not rely on another chord's result, so chance of error is greatly reduced. Chapter 14 \\"Truncations\\" has \\"Truncation by Rotation\\", which saves time on calculating the rest of the chords in dome, or moving chords by their symmetry.<br /><br />This \\"still nicely\\" bound book after a lot of use covers tension & tensegrities, subdivisions, great circles, symmetry & breakdowns, choosing a polyhedron, spherical coordinate system, ellipses & superellipses, truncations, space frames & many kinds of angles - plus charts & other resources @ the end.<br /><br />A free program on the web called Windome is useful to 8 decimals, but lacks input parameters like radius... So I use it to verify chord factors. From 2-16v involving about 12,240 chords plotting all verified (to 15 digits) on 1st try. Besides spreadsheets, formulas can be used in programming like \\"The R Project\\", formulas & programs are also written for old Hewlett-Packard HP-35, 21 & 45 series calculators & programs filed with the HP-65 library (circa mid-1970's). I guess it also goes to show Hewlett-Packard has a history in the PC & hardware programming business...<br /><br />One thing - spherical coordinate symbols for Theta & Phi are switched, though referenced in correct order (check Mathworld). Easy to correct, just read \\"Phi symbol\\" as Theta & \\"Theta symbol\\" as Phi - references & formulas will be in order. This book was written in mid-1970's, guess more? people then used this as convention.<br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />There are many good free sources on the web for geodesic domes & math plotting through Cartesian x,y,z and/or spherical Theta, Phi coordinates using basic trigonometry. This book cost me $13.57 shipped free brand new & is WELL worth it, even after searching the web...<br /><br />A final word of caution on building materials for domes in general: if you use wood make sure you take extra fireproofing precautions, unless it's a temporary frame. 2 domes here in town (on same lot) burnt down before fire department got to them - and they were right down the street! The intense heat from both fires left nothing except the slab & melted everything.<br /><br />So, when they start to burn there is very little time to exit the structure. As energy efficient as they are, the same design allows for a very efficient combustion, especially with wood stud frames & panels. Other problems arise as well with ventilating interior wood frames to help prevent condensation.<br /><br />There are many other materials that will not burn that could make up the panels (like from American Ingenuity, Inc.), or even a monolithic concrete pour over a temporary plastic covered geodesic wood frame. Another method that doesn't use geodesics is a \\"monolithic shotcreted airform dome\\" (from a company called Monolithic Dome Institute).h wood stud frames & panels.

The strategies are sound and well-explained. I'm impressed with the success of the three-legged position. Prior to writing the book, the author opened an online discount brokerage account and set up a portfolio based on the Income Model described in the book. Included in the book are his verified brokerage firm statements for the first year. His one-year results are impressive - a gain of 15.1% in a 12-month period when the S&P 100 gained 8.0%. I'd be happy to have an annual 15.1% gain on my stock market investments! <br /> <br />From reading the book, I now understand the importance of writing puts as well as covered calls. Covered calls are useful when a stock price falls - and if exercised, offer a way to sell stock above the current market price. The short puts are useful when a stock price rises - and if exercised, offer a way to buy the stock below the market price. I like being able to benefit from stock price movements in either direction. <br /> <br />I would love to have someone follow up with a monthly service that tells investors which stocks to use for establishing three-legged positions and which existing positions to write-up or close. Lacking that, I'll make my own investment decisions and hope to do as well as the author has done. The book certainly provides an excellent blueprint for making such decisions.	2005-09-27

I think this book is a first step for us jews to come out of the past, stop blaming something that happend 50 years ago and get on with our lives, we have to stop hiding behind an event that most people will forget ever happend in the near future, and we must emerge from this.	2005-09-25

When it starts and when it ends, the Bible and the history gives clue.  It applies to many elements of the history that are sacred to God to serve as symbols.  In the case of Jerusalem at the time of the Babylonian Empire, 70 years run from the death of Josiah in 609 BC, the last king  beloved of God (the siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of Judah followed his death) to the Fall of Babylon in 539 BC.  In the case of the end of the exile of the Jews it ran from the end of the kingship line of Jerusalem and Judah or the start of the desolation of the land in 585 BC after the last king Zedekiah was taken captive to the completion of the reconstruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 515 BC.  Or it can run from the ascendance of Nebuchadnezzar to the throne to the return of the Jews in their land to reconstruct the temple. In the case of the second destruction of the Temple in 70AD, it runs from the birth of Christ to the destruction of the Temple  <br /> <br />Here's a detailed chronology from the death of Josiah, King of Judah(checked and verified with the verses in the Bible and the dates in the history): <br /> <br /> <br />609 BC The forces of Egypt fought against the army of Judah. Necho II was allied with the Assyrians against the Babylonians.  Nabopolassar destroyed the remnants  of the Assyrian Empire. Josiah King of Judah died at the Battle of Megiddo while helping Babylon against Egypt. (II Kings 23: 29-30). Egypt prevailed against Judah (II Chronicles 34: 28) (II Chron 35:20-24). Start of the collapse of Judah and Jerusalem (II Kings 23:27) <br /> <br />Early 609 BC Jehoahaz became king of Judah, reigned for 3 months and replaced by Eliakim (Jehoiakim)  by Pharaoh Nechoh of Egypt, reigned eleven years in Jerusalem (until 598 BC) (II Chron 36:1-5) (II Kings 23: 30-36) .  Warning of the Lord to Israel about the temple and Jerusalem (Jerem 26: 1-6).  <br /> <br /> <br />609-605 Judah fell under the control of Egypt (II Kings 23: 34-35).  Further proof of this time (Jerem 26:21-23) <br /> <br />607/606 BC Nebuchadnezzar ascend to the throne.(Jeremiah 25:1) <br /> <br />606-605 BC Battle of Charchemish ( Nebuchadnezzar against Assyria and Egypt).  <br /> <br />605 BC Egypt was beaten by Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon  at the Battle of Charchemish, 4th year of Jehoiakim (Jerem 46: 1-2,10-11,13).  Babylon having eliminated his enemies, Assyria and Egypt, became powerful (Dan 2: 38) <br /> <br />605 BC. After defeating the Egyptians, the Babylonians had reached as far as the Philistine territory along the coast to the southwest of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon entered Jerusalem and besieged it. (Dan1:1) Jehoiakim, who had been put in power as a vassal of the Egyptians, declared allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar as Egypt would be probably defeated by Babylon at the Battle of Charchemish. This move placed Judah under the control of the Babylonians (FOR 3 YEARS : until 602 BC). (II Kings 24:1,7) <br />Jehoiakim was taken captive and Nebuchadnezzar took part of the vessel of the house of God. (Daniel1: 2) (II Chron 36:6-7) . Zedekiah was appointed king of Judah (Jerem 39:1). Although captivity started this time, Nebuchadnezzar had not brought all the people captives yet. They plan to come back for a second siege that would last 3 years to do that (Dan 1:3-5) .  There was no destruction of Temple at this time yet.  <br /> <br /> <br />604 BC Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams (Dan 2: 1).  The definitive interpretation of the dream happened at a later time. The astrologers and magicians took so much time (maybe years) in trying to guess the meaning  : Neb. Says \\"The thing is gone from me, you would gain the time\\" (Dan 2: 8) <br /> <br />602 BC Jehoiakim, encouraged by an apparent Babylonian retreat withdrew his allegiance from the Babylonians (2 Kings 24:1).   <br /> <br />End of 602 BC Ezekiel is already among the first captives brought to Babylon (Ezek 1:1-4), Ezek: 1: 1 is a conclusive sentence about all his set of visions when he finished having them (around 572 BC) and start writing about his visions.  He served of his conclusion as an introduction. In verse 2, he start detailing them.  Therefore, 30th year means, 30th year from the time of his captivity in Babylon. One of his visions (Ezek 12: 10-16) may have occurred exactly at this time, before being taken captive, since many people have not been taken captives yet.  <br /> <br /> <br />Late 598 BC Death of Jehoiakim (after 11 years of reign).  <br /> <br /> <br />597 BC Reign of Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) his son, reigned for 3 months (2 Kings 24: 6, 8). Jehoiachin was then removed by the Babylonians. (II Chronicles 36: 9-10) <br /> <br />596 BC Visions of God showing Ezekiel the abominations of Israel and its priests(Ezek 8: 1) (Ezek 9: 1-2,11, Ezek 12:27-28) <br /> <br />Late 597 or early 596 BC - Second invasion of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar  <br />Nebuchadnezzar invaded Jerusalem, at the 9th year  of Zedekiah, as king of Judah (Jerem 39:1).  Zedekiah was placed king of Jerusalem to replace Jehoiachin [he was nominated king of Judah at the time of the captive of Jehoiakim in Jerusalem by the Babylonians (Jeremiah 27:1, 12-13, Jerem 37:1) (II Chronicles 36: 9-11) ], reigned 11 years in Jerusalem (from 597 BC until 586 BC, end of the kingship of Jerusalem and Judah) (Jerem 52:1). The people of Jerusalem were taken captives along with Daniel and the people of Judah (II Kings 24: 10-11,16-18) (II Kings 25: 1-2) (Jeremiah 22: 25-27) (Jeremiah 29:1-2,4) (Esther 2:6) (Dan1:6).  A further proof that the temple was not yet destroyed at this time is Jeremiah 38: 14. Further proof, that at the time of the reign of Zedekiah in Jerusalem, the temple still existed at this time is II Chron 36: 14.  According to God's prophecy and Jeremiah's account (Jeremiah 27: 19-22), at the time the second captivity (Jehoiachin was taken captive after 3 months of reign in 597 BC), part the vessels, after the second invasion still remain in the house of the Lord but will be carried to Babylon at a later time (a proof that there was a second invasion and after that second invasion and an inference that there will be a 3rd invasion). The temple still existed to house those pillars and left-behind vessels at this time.   <br /> <br />596 BC The decree to slain the wise men for not being able to interpret the dreams was published (Dan 2:12-13)  <br /> <br />595 BC The Lord spoke to Ezekiel about the abominations of Israel, letting Ezekiel know that he can change the course of events (Ezek 20) <br /> <br />595 BC Psammetichus ascended to the throne of Egypt,  <br /> <br />593 BC Probably aware of the new ascendance to the throne of the new King of Egypt who could save the people of Jerusalem, Hananiah told a false prophecy to Jeremiah \\"in the House of the Lord\\" (Jeremiah 28: 1-4, 4th year of Zedekiah in Jerusalem) (Ezek 13: 3,6).  <br /> <br />593 BC (9th year of captivity) Vision of Ezekiel God telling him that at the very same time, Nebuchadnezzar set himself against Jerusalem.  In 593 BC, the army of Nebuchadnezzar are still present in Babylon from 596 BC as it was told in Daniel 1: 5 that their food ration for the second invasion should last for 3 years. God told Ezekiel that \\"he WILL profane his sanctuary\\", which means he had not destroyed the temple yet but will.(Ezek 24: 1-2, 21).   <br /> <br /> <br />592 BC Psammetichus (King of the 26th dynasty of Egypt) marched into the Kingdom of Judah, Philistia (southern coast of Canaan), and Phoenicia in response to moves made by Babylon  (Jerem 37:5).  The Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem departed as soon as they heardof their coming.   <br /> <br />592 BC (10th year of captivity) Vision of Ezekiel about the imminent destruction of Jerusalem as a warning (5th year captivity of Jehoiachin) (Ezek 1:2-4, Ezek 4:1-3, Ezek 5:4-5).  That year in his vision God told Ezekiel about the number of years of iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah (430 years from the time of the vision 592BC: 390 years + 40 years) . (Cf. year 162 BC what will happen). Hananiah died when Ezekiel prophesied. (Ezek 11: 13, Ezek 13: 8-9) <br /> <br />592 BC Vision of Ezekiel against Pharaoh of Egypt (10th year of captivity) (Ezek 29:1-3).  Jeremiah proceeded to tell the king of Judah that Pharaoh's army who would come to save them shall return to Egypt. And the Chaldeans shall come again and burn Jerusalem with fire (God announced the third invasion). (Jeremiah 37: 7-8)  <br /> <br /> <br />591 BC (11th year of captivity) Vision of Ezekiel concerning the destruction of Tyrus  (Phoenician city in Lebanon on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea) (Ezek 26:7) and the defeat of Egypt by Babylon <br /> <br />589 BC Pharaoh Hophrah ascended to the throne of Egypt <br /> <br />588 BC Pharaoh Hophra sent an army to relieve the siege of Jerusalem, forcing the Babylonians to disengage to meet them but no avail (Jerem 37: 7) <br /> <br />588 BC-586 BC Third invasion of Jerusalem <br />Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon by forming an alliance with Pharaoh Hophrah (II Kings 24: 20, Jerem 52: 3). He was taken captive. Vision of Ezekiel against Zedekiah.  God told Ezekiel about the princes and the king Zedekiah (Jerusalem \\"had taken of the king's seed (king Nebuchadnezzar's seed) and made a covenant with him\\", \\"in the place where the king dwells that made him king\\" \\"he despised the oath by breaking the covenant\\" \\"he shall not escape\\") who rebelled against Babylon and are taken captives that neither Pharaoh can save him in the war (Ezek 17: 12-18) <br />A last warning from God was sent again to the people of Jerusalembut they rebuked the messengers of God. (II Chron 36: 15-16). II Kings 25: 1,3 indicates that the third invasion was carried out in different times (not part of the same year) from the destruction of the temple.  The day of the famine and the destruction of the temple are part of the same year (11th year of of Zedekiah, 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar 586 BC) (II Kings 25: 3, 8)  The Babylonians came back to besiege Jerusalem on the 9th year of reign of Zedekiah as king of Jerusalem and stayed until his 11th year (II Kings 25: 1-3)  (Jerem 52: 4-5, Zedekiah`s 9th year in Jerusalem) (II Chron 36: 17-20, the final invasion)  <br /> <br />586 BC 3 years later, on the 11th year of Zedekiah as King of Jerusalem. Destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem by a captain guard of Nebuchadnezzar on the 19th year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar  (II Kings 25:8-10) (Jeremiah 39:8-9) (II Chronicles 34: 24-25) (Ezek 5:2, 4-5, Ezek 14: 14-15) <br /> <br />585 BC End of the kingship of Judah and Jerusalem and of Jerusalem.  Jerusalem a desolate land <br /> <br />586 BC The army of Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyrus without success for 13 years (Ezek 29: 18) <br /> <br />575 BC The vision of Ezekiel against Egypt including those Jews who escaped the captivity to go to Egypt and other parts (27th year of captivity)(Ezek 29: 17-20, Ezek 30:10-11) (Jeremiah 44:1, 12-14, 27-30) <br /> <br />572 BC Ezekiel was writing his visions of Ezekiel (30th year of captivity) (Ezek 29: 1, ) <br /> <br />570 BC  Amasis II became king of Egypt <br /> <br />Late 570 or 569 BC Babylonia had invaded Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar Inscription This clay tablet reads, \\"In the thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to Egypt [Misr] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected [his army], and marched and spread abroad.\\" The inscription is now on display in the British Museum in London. <br /> <br />568 BC Amasis II appears to have sustained an attack by Nebuchadnezzar <br /> <br />559 BC Cyrus the Great ascended to the throne of Anshan (part of Persia).  Start of the Achaemenid Empire or Persian Empire with his unification of the kingdom of Anshan and the rest of Persia. <br /> <br />550 BC-549 BC, with the help of Harpagus, Cyrus led the Persians and his armies to capture and effectively conquer Media (Median Empire was still ruled by the grand father of Cyrus who hates him).  Cyrus defeated the forces of Media.  Cyrus became the Shah of unified Persian kingdom (Media and Persia).  He took Lydia in Asia Minor, and carried his arms eastward into central Asia. <br /> <br />547 BC Babylon and Egypt had formed a mutual alliance against the rising threat of a third power, the Persian empire-but to no avail <br /> <br />546 BC The conquest of Asia Minor (546 BC) left the Ionian Greeks under Persian rule, while the other Greeks were free.  Persian satraps (governors) of Asia Minor installed tyrants in most of Ionian cities and forced Greeks to pay taxes for the \\"King of Kings\\". <br /> <br />541 BC Belshazzar was made king ( Talmud Meg 11b) <br /> <br />540 BC The Persians were planning to advance on Babylon.  <br /> <br />539 BC According to the Hebrew Bible, while Belshazzar and the nobles of the empire were feasting and drinking from the chalices taken from the Hebrew Temple of Jerusalem, a hand wrote an unknown Aramaic text on the wall: mene, mene, tekel, uparsin.  None of Belshazzar's soothsayers could translate the words written and then the Jew Daniel, known for his accurate prophecies was called to translate the text and he said: \\"God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end. You are weighed in the balances and are found wanting. Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.\\" These words indicated the arrival of the Persian king Cyrus the Great who rode out to conquer Babylon.   (Daniel 5: 1-7, 24-28) <br /> <br />539 BC Belshazzar was positioned in the city of Babylon to hold the capital, while Nabonidus his father, marchedhis troops north to meet Cyrus. On October 10, 539 B.C. Nabonidus surrendered and fled from Cyrus. Two days later, October 12, 539 B.C., the Persian armies overthrew the city of Babylon. Belshazzar was slain (Dan 5:30-31) <br /> <br />539 BC Cyrus entered Babylon : Cyrus declared on a stone tablet: \\"I (am) Cyrus, the king of the world, the king of Babylon, the king of Shumer and Akkad, the king of the four regions . . . When I entered Tintar (ancient name of Babylon) peacefully . . . I established my sovereignty in the palace of the princes, Marduk (the Babylonian national god), inclined the noble hearts of the people of Babylon towards me\\".  This is the first year reign of Cyrus in Babylon, Daniel stayed in Babylon until this time (Dan1 :21) (The prophecy of Dan 2: 35) <br /> <br />539 BC Fall of Babylon.  <br /> <br />537 BC Cyrus (King of Babel) authorized the return to Palestine of the Jews deported by Nebuchadnezzar and arranged for the rebuilding of the Hebrew temple in Jerusalem. (Jeremiah 29: 14)  <br /> <br />530 BC Cambyses II (Cyrus, son of Cyrus the Great) ascended the throne of Persia <br /> <br />527 BC Hippias succeeded his father (Pisistratus) as a tyrant of Athens <br /> <br />526 BC Cyrus (Cambyses II) , ruler of Persia conquers Egypt and annexed it to the Persian empire. His attempt to conquer Kush (the kingdoms of Napata and Sudan), Siwa Oasis, and Carthage failed <br /> <br />525 BC The Persians conquered Egypt.  For the first time in its 2,500-year history as a nation, Egypt was no longer independent. (Ezek 30: 12-13) <br /> <br />After 525 BC Persians, Greco-Macedonians and Romans ruled Egypt  <br /> <br />522 BC A usurper of the crown of Persia (Smerdis) arose. <br /> <br />521 BC Death of Cyrus killed in the battle with Smerdis.  Darius killed the usurper of the crown (Gaumata or Smerdis) <br /> <br />521 - 481 BC The reign of Darius the Great, of the seed of the Medes <br />Every region was responsible for paying a gold or silver tribute tothe emperor; many areas, such as Babylonia, underwent severe economic decline resulting from these quotas.  He was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans (Dan 9:1). He ruled over an immense realm, from western China to eastern Europe <br /> <br />515 BC Completion of the construction of the temple of Jerusalem <br /> <br /> <br />I do not understand at all why the JWs want so much to remake history because everything has to arrive at 1914?? By reading and analyzing the prophecy of the Bible, 1914 the Holocaust was part of history -- sad and horrible of course- but is in a way a punishment of God (many parts of what the Lord said in the old Testament still apply in today's events), after that the Lord had scattered them again to the four corners of the Earth (the survivors of the Holocaust)and later great Britain settled them in land that is called Israel. The prophecy in the Old Testament that The Lord has gathered them from the corners of the Earth will settle them in a land called the land of Israel has been fulfilled again. For the Jews, such event could only be interpreted as the rejection of Satan on earth. And since many aspects of the principles of the Congregation quite resemble the Judaism religion (publication of many materials other than the Bible, the much lesser importance given to Jesus Christ, the ignorance of the \\"spirit\\" as part of what constitutes a person even though the New testament emphasize this aspect because in Hebrew, the concept is absent -- only those parts of the Old Testament written in other original language other than Hebrew refers to spirit, epecially, those written by the captives, the resort to Hebrew language to change the word \\"grave\\" and \\"hell\\" in the New Testament even though the original language is in Greek, etc.),I assume that Jews constitute an influential membership into the organization at the time of its formation. As a result, they find it hard to contemplate, that the Holocaust might be a punishment of the Lord again, so there has to be another explanation. They assume the reign of Nebuchadnezzar at 624 BC. Even so, 624 and 607 does not give 19 years of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, exact time at which the temple was burned. They assume that there were only 2 invasions and the Temple of Jerusalem was burned during the second invasion.  Many parts in the Bible indicated in the above chronology indicate that at the second invasion there was no destruction of the Temple and after the second invasion the Lord prophesied about a third invasion that will burn the Temple. False prophecy and it's not the first.   <br /> <br />	2005-09-21

I'd hoped for more of Smith's taking us into the past and ancient Egypt, but THE SEVENTH SCROLL was strictly an archaelogical adventure novel set in modern-day Egypt.  Still, he can be a riveting writer, so much better than so many bestselling authors out there today, if it wasn't for his lapses of logic and fiddling with credibility about the time it takes characters to do something suspenseful.  The bad guys' and nature's menacing action always move comparatively quickly; they seem to be going to do in the main characters within minutes.  By contrast, the good guys seem to have weeks to get out of their way, marveling over the sights, packing artifacts, shepherding crowds of local bearers  single-file out of long and complicated passages out of tombs, etc.  That just doesn't compute.  Likewise in order to get the hero and heroine in worse trouble --i.e., for dramatic effect--he has them hit with a stupid stick at times.  After photos and translations of hieroglyphics from the Seventh Scroll are stolen from the heroine once, she and our hero replicate in photos, etc., of much the same information from a stone stele [pillar] they discover.  Then they spread them all over their tent in their camp on the \\"dig,\\" leaving them unconcealed just so the villain's men with every kind of modern equipment and firepower can overrun their camp and steal it all again.  This though our hero and heroine know the bad guys' camp is nearby, and they are very hostile.  How dumb is this?  Then the hero sends a secondary female character to make a phone call in a village that gets her captured by the villains, when all along he has a radio he could have used to transmit a message or ten out just by climbing out of the Nile gorge. Then there is the central premise of the plot, that Taita, the narrator of RIVER GOD, set to the task of building and concealing a tomb for his pharoah, would leave allkinds of clues carved into rock telling those who can figure them out where the tomb is. The whole idea of traps, etc., and concealment of any pharoah's tomb--barring the pyramids--was to make it undiscoverable by tomb robbers, not play riddling games with whoever could figure out where it was and how to find the actual burial chamber. Plus there really wasn't a ticking clock to get the treasures out of the tomb before the bad guys might or the Nile shifted into its flood stage.  The hieroglypics stolen by the villain were so enigmatic it was a good bet even before Smith verified it that the bad guys couldn't figure out what the heroine had from them.  All the good guys had to do was break camp, go home to England or Cairo, and wait a year or two to come back and explore safely, well aware the villain couldn't crack the code.  And, of course, the reader can easily figure out the burial chamber and treasures of the pharoah had to be safely hidden above the high water level of the Nile in flood, so they wouldn't be in danger from the coming annual flood.   Smith writes long detailed scenes depicting absolutely every single thing that happens in the novel, and it is enriching for those of us who have never thought too much about Africa, the land itself.  But the last quarter of the book really was too drawn out, though the little twist at the end was satisfying. It just took forever to get there.  And most of the time the reader was a step or two ahead of the characters and narrative in what might happen next as to where the pharoah's tomb had to be, etc. <br />Good writing, lazy plotting and faulty pace.	2005-09-21

A significant conributor to the meme that humans are a significant factor in global warming are the predictions of unverified climate models. Most of the media and psuedo scientists don't mention these sticky little details. Currently, these models all predict certain relationships between surface and tropospheric temperatures that are not validated by the observed data...even after the much publicized corrections to the data. I find it amusing that this guy uses global warming as an example of right wing preconceptualism when it is much more likely that it is an example of left wing preconceptualism.	2005-09-21

However, it is rambling and somewhat disconnected, and could have been condensed to a long magazine article.  It also suffers from a significant flaw in reasoning.  It starts from an assumption that religious experiences are real (and universally desired) and this colors the conclusions the authors draw.  The authors reason that:  <br /> <br />1.  Some people have \\"religious experiences\\". <br />2.  These religous experiences are real, universally desired, and connect the user to the spiritual world. <br />3.  What part of the brain allows people to connect to the spiritual world? <br />4.  How has this been useful in mankind's development? <br /> <br />The assumption that the religious experiences are real is not a valid basis for a scientific experiment.  One of the basic assumptions of an experiment cannot be that something exists when that something cannot be tested or verified.  The entire set of experiments should have been:  <br /> <br />1.  Some people have \\"religious experiences\\". <br />2.  These are likely measureable through blood-flow changes in the brain. <br />3.  What part(s) of the brain is affected and how does this change take place?   <br />4.  How does this explain the power of religious experiences? <br />5.  Can this change be taught or duplicated through artificial means, and if so, what does that tell us about brain chemistry? <br /> <br />This is a subtle but very important difference.  Regardless of the religious beliefs of the scientist, scientific experiments must have a firm, verifiable foundation.  The authors have allowed their beliefs to cloud the interpretation of data on a very interesting subject.  The result is a pretty good new-agey spiritual book, but a flawed scientific one.    <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

I'd rate it higher, except that it's overly detailed in some cases. The book is as much about the author's eforts to uncover the truth behind Marianne's memories (vs. those of others she knew) as it is about Marianne's life. I found the author's very detailed account of getting info out of Marianne and her acquaintances too much information; all I cared about was Marianne's story, not how he found out and verified every detail. I recommend it, as long as you're prepared to skim when your eyes glaze over.	2005-09-20

If the story is true, then it could explain Roswell.  If its not true, its just another jewel encrusted helmet on the Roswell dung heap. <br />  The basic Roswell story has been around for years, with quite a number of witnesses from ranking officers down telling a story about the crash of an ET ship, the recovery of bodies and so forth.   <br />     Over the years we have heard quite a number of people attempt to explain away Roswell, with very little sucess.  We have also heard various witnesses come forward and tell incredible stories that can be verified, and we have heard some incredible stories that cannot be verified.  We have had witness tell inaccurate stories and so on and so forth.   <br />   The problems with the stories told  by people in the Redfern book (not the author) is that we are again dealing with people who are telling an incredible story, yet we don't know as yet IF the their background can be independently verified or checked out. Did they actually in fact work where they claimed to have worked?   Did they actually hold the rank and or position they claimed to have been?   Does anybody that worked at those locations recall them?  <br />  For example I remember a person who purported himself to be an Air Force Colonel who told some pretty incredible stories. When people finally got around to independently checking his background, such as supposed service records and  unit historys, people found out that he didn't even show up.   He pretty much faded away after that.  <br />  Even if the witnesses can be checked out and verified, apparently there are no documents that can verify the story these witnesses told Nick Redfern...at this point.   <br />   So in the end we have an interesting story that may be true.

I am reading this book currently and I am enjoying it as a work of FICTION that it is.  I am not a member of the community but have been aware of it for years.  Please do not view this as a criticism as I am fan of the book but rather as a request for comment out of my own quesitoning and curiosity as an outsider.<br /><br />I would be interested in commentary on the following points that came up as I was reading:<br /><br />1. The Book is a work of FICTION.  If you do not believe me please read the small print on the first few pages at the beggining it says that some of the people presented in the book are composites of three or more people.  It is also found in the FICTION section of the bookstore.  NOTE:  I am aware that the GURUS are real people and do exist.<br /><br />2. The author and many of the GURUS presented, freely admit to wanting to be respected and rise in the community's standing.  The way to do this is to demonstrate amazing PUA skills and success.  This is often done through the online community by posting amazing success stories.  Therefore the credibility of the success stories in the posts is questionable as so far as they are mainly marketing materials that cannot be verified.  If a GURU or aspiring community climber successfully posts innovative advice and success stories there is much to be gained in the admiration from the community and financially as well.<br /><br />3.  This is a highly profitable industry.  The seminar industry in general and the GURU seminars in general is a highly lucrative and profitable industry.  The barrier to entry is non-existant as anyone who has gotten the attention of the community can invite people to a public location (ie. Mystery and the Roosevelt lobby) and present and take students to a bar afterwards.  Once a Guru is established the fees rise substantially (ie. Mystery's course fee in the book goes from $500.00 initially to over $2000.00 in the books appendix).  Even if the GURU becomes established and his seminars become too big for a small intimate free setting, he can rent out a conference room in one of many hotels for relatively little cost and maintain high profitability as business expands.  In addition the established GURU produces product (DVDS, Tapes, Books, etc.) which are almost pure profit.  With the lucrative seminars and products there is a strong incentive for the GURU and his \\"organization\\" to do whatever it takes to maintain his business going.<br /><br />4. This is a completely UNREGULATED industry and underground community.  The fact is that the GURU industry is unregulated means that the claims made by the GURUS do not need to be substantiated by independent sources and research as do claims by regulated industries such as the pharmaceutical industry.  In addition the PUA is a private mostly underground community consisting of people who want to believe in the GURUS claims as they had been unsuccessful on their own. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with giving some hope to anyone but the person needs to come into it with open eyes that there is money to be made and results are not guaranteed.<br /><br />5.  There is no credible outside studies of the group that show double blind tests - ie. how an AFC  vs. a PUA would fare in getting phone numbers from random women in populated locations.<br /><br />The following sources do not qualify as \\"credible\\"  - A testimony from the GURU himself, someone associated with the GURU who is benefiting financially or socially from the GURU and his enterprise, or a single author (sorry Neil- I like the book but you are but one person and you too have a lot to gain but the book's success).<br /><br />6.  When is a HB an 8? a 9? a 10?<br /><br />If I tell you that I seduced a 9 or a 10 and describe her to you in writing, what you picture in your mind will most probably be completely different from that reality of the person who I claim to have seducted.  This is a fundamental propisition of NLP.<br /><br />Itseems that underlying promise of the seduction GURU (even if it is not explicit) and many of the community posts for that matter is that you will get a HOT/ATTRACTIVE woman who you would not have otherwise gotten without the seduction knowledge.  There are many discussions in the book about how attractive the women being seduced was.  The problem with all this is beauty is in the eye of the beholder and qualifying someone as hot or an 8/9/10 depends on a person's filter.  While there are scientific studies showing what are attractive characteristics that appeal to many cultures (ie. symmetry, etc.) the individual's filter also plays a significant role in deciding level of attractiveness.  One person may find women who would be classified as obese as extremely attractive, another person may highly prize Asian women although he Caucasian, etc.  Therefore it is not unreasonable to suggest that the women that are portrayed as highly prized targets may not be what you would consider as \\"hot\\"/>It seems that underlying promise of the seduction GURU (even if it is not explicit) and many of the community posts for that matter is that you will get a HOT/ATTRACTIVE woman who you would not have otherwise gotten without the seduction knowledge.

I made a poor choice.  These are the problems: <br /> <br />1)  I don't find verbose, convoluted stories to be constructive learning tools.  For example, a paragraph in the book on Niacin deficiency.... \\"Picture a nice scene on a frozen lake.  You are skating on the lake and have a cheery outlook because you think you will be free (B3).  You accidentally take \\"Pellagra\\" instead of Viagra and how have Dementia, Diarrhea, Dermatitis (from falling so many time).  Skating with dementia leads to Vertigo witih your tongue hanging out, resulting in glossitis.\\"  HUH?? <br /> <br />2)  I found a lot of inaccuracies in the book, many of which I verified in the Red Book as well as Nelson's.  At this point in the game, you really don't want to be second guessing the knowledge you already have. <br /> <br />3)  The organization of the book just doesn't work for me.  I think they have some nice high yield pointers, but in general, there's so much silly stuff (like the pictorials in the margins) that's distracting. <br /> <br />I would not recommend investing $100 on this book.  Flip through a colleague's version before purchasing it.	2005-09-14
US	45680840	R3KC6CHRMMDSVA	0898799465	974551584	Plot (Elements of Fiction Writing)	Books	1	49	63	N	N	Easily one of the worst books on the topic: sloppy, unstructured & patronizing	This book, which purports to be about plot, is about anything but plot. In this book, which lacks any recognizable structure or internal organisation, the author shares a number of tidbits about the creative process in general and writing in particular. While some of the information conveyed is helpful - in the same way that an open-minded and interested person might glean advice from pretty much anything written on writing -, much of it consists of platitudes, clumsily camouflaged as the wisdom imparted by an experienced author. The latter cannot be verified, however, given that the book is published under a nom de plum.  <br /> <br />It took me a while to figure out what was wrong about this book at it's core, but finally in chapter 6 Ansen Dibell spells it out clearly: \\"As I've said before, stories - especially live, convincing stories - will change under your hands. That's the reason I've never been persuaded of the usefulness of outlines.\\" (P. 72) Well, the point Dibell makes here is one that is, indeed, shared by some authors, and while there may be some strong arguments to support Dibell's point of view on the usefulness of outlines, how someone with such a dismissive attitude towards outlining and planning could have been chosen to write the book on plot in the \\"Elements of Fiction Writing\\", in which this book is published, is beyond me.  <br /> <br />As with nearly everything else the author says about the writing process the above mentioned is an example of how the author presents her personal opinions as the ultimate truth about writing. In a book of that sort - which, again, appears in a series that claims to provide specific advice for writers - it's not only unbalanced not to talk about the pros and cons of having an outline for a longer piece of fiction, but it is also unprofessional and does not deliver what is promised by this series of books, namely even-handed, professional advice.  <br /> <br />The sloppy and breezy style that the author employsthroughout the book assumes an unwarranted familiarity with the reader and feels at times patronizing, especially given that the reader has no way of checking the author's other credentials, given that the book is published under a pen name. There is, of course, no rule that says that people who write about writing ought to be good writers themselves. As a matter of fact it is conceivable that someone writes very well about writing fiction without ever having published any fiction at all. But if a book is as badly and sloppily written as this particular book, it is rather frustrating not to be able to go and see whether at least the fiction published by that author has some merit to it. It is nearly equally frustrating to read through the raving reviews this book has received on Amazon.com - I cannot help but suspect that they are the product of some kind of manipulation.  <br /> <br />I have read, with great attention, a variety of books on writing fiction, ranging from the superb - e.g. several books on the topic by John Gardner - to the less impressive, but still useful and practical - e.g. James N. Frey's How to write a damn good novel - and finally those books that are written in the manner and style of the mindless Self-Help books that give self-education via books such a bad name. Ansen Dibell's book certainly belongs to the latter category.	2005-09-10

Coleman brings together an interesting compilation of short stories that seeks to explore the deepest recesses of the human mind. The thought-provoking stories are bound to keep the reader glued to the edge of the seat because of their surprise endings. <br /> <br />Written in a crisp language and captivating style, the short stories, transport the reader to the enchanting world of possibilities.

Each story, which is more like a novella, ends with a stunning climax coupled with a moral. <br /> <br />Ranging from being scary to challenging, the stories take the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotional turns and twists. \\"The Winner\\" introduces reader to the life of Brock Tipton and his trip to a bar where each guest is required to tell a genuine story that can be verified in order to make use of the facilities offered therein. Tipton's story turns out to be too horrifying to be true, but it is.

But the wait turns out to be a very long one for her. <br /> <br />\\"The Haggle\\" is a tale of business transaction that turns out to be a ghastly nightmare for Gary Allen Short. \\"The Long Flight\\" is about a flight undertaken by Dr. Rob M.

Number one JFK was late & 10 min before the motorcade arrived, Lee Harvey Oswald was seen eating in the lunch room on the 2nd floor. 90 seconds after the last shot Officer Marion Baker spotted Oswald in the same room drinking a coke, calm & not aggitated. There were 3 shells on the 6th floor, although one had a dent in it. But the 1st rifle found was a German Mauser 7.5 not the Manlicer. This was found & verified by 3 deputy sherrifs, one who had a sporting goods store, all three very familar with rifles. Oswald's rifle was not even tested to see if it had been fired that day. There were no nitrates on his face from the paraffin tests, but some on his hands which could have come from the ink in the boxes. Meaning he did not fire a rifle that day, unless he was wearing a plastic mask. The bag found before the FBI destroyed it & made a new one was not long enough to carry a Manlicer Carcano even broken down. The palm print on the rifle was not found byt the FBI, & was not found until after OSwalds death.  If you look at the Zapruder film, as JFK comes out from the sign, there is a splinter on the windshield just below the mirror proving a frontal shot as all the doctors at Parkland stated he received in his neck. Several reporters stated that there was a bullet hole in the windshield the size of a #2 pencil. My brother is a police investigator with over 30yrs experience including Army Intel & told me while at the book depository that there is a live oak tree just past the one it was said he couldn't have made the 1st shot at that time. He told me that between the two trees 3 shots could not have been shot even with an automatic rifle. If you look at the autopsy photo you can see a bullet hole above the right temple, Fr Huber who gave JFK the last rites stated that there was a bullet hole in his right temple. You have to be a moron to not realize that the last shot was a frontal shot, I don't care about fantasies like jet wash effect. I have talked to several police officers including my brother that state there is no way a body is going to move violently towards the shot period. I have studied the assassination for over 20yrs (I was 12 when JFK was shot) & I took a college course on it, in where I already knew 90% of what the professor was teaching. Oswald could not have made it to the 2nd floor in time to be found by police in the 90 seconds that passed. Having 1st crossed the room zig-zag around many boxes, whipped the rifle (all while his heart is beating like crazy - hopefully he won't get caught), run down the stairs, pass two women who do not see anyone & be on the 2nd floor drinking a coke cool & collected instead of making it out the building so he couldn't get caught. The whole case against him is  ridiculous. The rifle had to be fitted with shims because the FBI couldn't fire it accurately. Not one of the professional riflemen duplicated what Oswald was accused of. They fired at stationary targets 30 ft down below not moving targets over 60 ft down & going away from them. Not one of them hit their targets in the neck & head area. You have to be a real moron to believe what the FBI & the Warren Commission accused Oswald of.	2005-09-09

This book has created a great amount of controversy.  To be honest, if you are a WWI historian who is pro-French and pro-British, you are going to hate this book.  If you are pro-German and pro-American, you will very much appreciate it.  And if you want to insert yourself somewhere into this divide, this book will quickly get you there.  The other reviews about this book say a lot: some are supportive, some are negative, and some are so negative as to be incoherent.  Therefore, I will give you reasons why you should pay attention to this book, and you can judge this book as you like.  First, Mosier is fluent in English, French and German.  He has toured and surveyed most of the Western Front battlefields and examined many of the cemeteries.  He has even visited the battlefields with modern military officers, who helped guide him in understanding the military value of the terrain.  Therefore, he has been at the battlefields and knows the terrain on both a tactical and strategic level, and his knowledge and first-hand experience shows in the book.  His tactical and military explanations, such as describing artillery and assault tactics, are approved as accurate by officers of many armies.  Second, Mosier has access to German archives, and from these he brings very compelling pieces of information to the table.  Each chapter is very thoroughly annotated, with sources given at the end of every chapter.  When one scans down these lists of sources, one will notice just as many entries from German sources as there are from French and British sources.  As a historian of many fields, I am very cognizant of the fact that an overwhelming volume of WWI history comes from British sources.  The inclusion of German sources in Mosier's analysis is very important in the WWI discussion, and one cannot discount sources from the Reichsarchiv in Berlin as propaganda without serious justifications.  Third, the culmination of the book is Mosier's explanation of the events of 1918.  Afterfour years of war, why was Germany suddenly able to break apart the Western Front?  Why did the British and French armies lose so much territory in the first half of that year?  If the Germans could do that in 1918, why did they not do it earlier?  And what impact did the US Army have on the Western Front at this point?  Mosier offers his answers to these questions, with his well-researched justifications as well.  I found this book to be a very cutting challenge to traditional WWI history.  I also found that it cannot be swept under the rug very easily.  The information in the book is very well annotated, sourced, studied and verified by other sources.  I would introduce this book to students just to teach them the skill of using sources, footnotes and bibliographies in reports.  I would mention that Mosier's style of writing is a bit inflammatory, which helps fan the flames of controversy.  I don't think his writing is revisionist per se - rather it is bringing some additional data and perspective to the table in a brash and audacious way.  This in turn polarizes his readers.  In summary, I think this is an excellent book and I tend to pull it off the shelf every couple years and re-read it to pull out different perspectives.  Once you learn to tune out the brash statements and pull out his points and perspectives, they certainly add a new dimension to the popular WWI narrative.	2005-09-09

I was a Platoon Leader in the 3rd Platoon and I have been in contact with many members who were there at the same time as his time period. So far not one member remembers him or his supposed exploits. There never was a combat jump on a NVA Hospital, pure fiction, He was not a graduate of the Ranger School (Can be verified thru the Freedom of Information Act), the list can go on and on. It is a shame that the University of New Mexico Press would print a book without checking it's authenticity. I'm sure many others members of this unit will also write reviews.	2005-09-09

It might be worth your while to purchase it for that reason.   <br /> <br />However, the discriminating consumer should be forewarned that some of the data contained in this guide is inaccurate.  The data is self-reported data collected from law schools.  Since all the schools want to increase their U.S. News ranking, they sometimes report information that is inaccurate--or arguably fraudulent.  I found this out the hard way.  I attended a Top 20 U.S. News Law School.  When I enrolled in the law school--and ever since--U.S. News has reported that the school I attended has roughly a 97% employment rate at graduation and that the median salary for graduates of my school was close to $100,000.   <br /> <br />The year I graduated from the school--2004--maybe 40-50% of students had jobs at graduation.  Many classmates of mine, for all I know, do not have jobs as of today.  Of those students who had jobs at graduation, many were working low-paying jobs for smaller law firms or for state agencies.  In other words, the U.S. News data was way off the mark.   <br /> <br />I recognize that it is difficult for U.S. News to police the data supplied by law schools, but they need to do a better job of it.  They could also use some common sense.  For instance, U.S. News reports that over 95% of USC Law grads have jobs at graduation, and that the average salary is close to $100,000.  But in its guide to business schools, U.S. News reports that 89% of Harvard Business School grads are employed at graduation with the average salary being $85,000 or so.  How could career prospects possibly be better for USC Law grads than Harvard Business School grads?  I don't believe it, and I don't see how U.S. News could believe it either.   <br /> <br />It amazes me that law schools are able to report borderline fraudulent information and U.S. News does nothing.  I was one of those who believed the U.S. News data, but then found out the hard way that the data was woefully inaccurate.   <br /> <br />If you buy this guide, try to get as much as you can out of it, but take all the data you read with a grain of salt.  Much of it was reported by law schools with an interest in inflating the data, and none of the data is ever independently verified.   <br /> <br />	2005-09-07

Thorsson is extremely well grounded in traditional lore and the material is presented in a logical and progressive manner, though it goes beyond basic material.  It can certainly serve as a primer for the determined newbie, but I would recommend Bernard King's \\"Way of the Runes\\" as the best primer I have encountered for getting to know the basics.   <br /> <br />The writing style is admittedly a little dry, but this book must be seen as the scholarly treatise that it is. <br /> <br />So why three stars?  Thorsson leans very heavily on the Armamen system developed by Guido von List and others a hundred years ago.  I would have no problem with this if he pointed it out in the book, clearly delineating what can be verified from the elder lore, what he has drawn from the Armamen system, and what has grown out of his own experience and speculation. <br /> <br />The most panned aspect of this work, stadha-galdr, or \\"runic yoga\\" has gotten it labelled as fluff by many Heathens.  It should be known that this practise actually derives from the Armamen system and is not a whole cloth invention of Thorsson's. <br /> <br />On the whole, I give the material 4 stars, the presentation 2.	2005-09-06

It is actually an on-going interview with the very ill Emmerich.  There is a lot of repetition because her words are not often edited but she tells some amazing information much of which is verified by ancient writings other than the Bible.

The author discusses the history of the subject as well as giving a thorough discussion of modern developments. In addition, many references are given for readers who want to investigate the subject in more detail. The philosophy of law has become even more important in recent years due to the social tensions surrounding the Supreme Court of the United States as well as the difficult legal issues involved in nation building.<br /><br />The following questions, among many others, arose for this reviewer when reading the book, with some of them being answered in the book and some not:<br /><br />1. What is the difference, if any, between standards and rules?<br /><br />2. What is the difference, if any, between substantive justice and formal justice?<br /><br />3. Does the granting of broad discretionary powers to legal officials encourage abuse?<br /><br />4. When a legal rule ages, does it become less or more applicable to the activities it is supposed to refer to, i.e. will judges become more tempted to declare exceptions and extensions to it?<br /><br />5. How important is the use of formal logic in legal deliberations?<br /><br />6. Can most, or even all, legal argumentation/deliberation be given an algorithmic or formulaic definition?<br /><br />7. Can statutes or constitutions, being forms of communication, be verified in the same way as scientific hypotheses can?<br /><br />8. Does good legal judgment consist of caution, detachment, imagination, and common sense or must these be supplemented by other activities or modes of cognition?<br /><br />9. Is law an autonomous discipline, with the designation \\"autonomous\\" given its usual intuitive meaning?<br /><br />10. Can the complexity of legal deliberations/reasoning of a judge be modeled successfully using a language or framework that is clearly not being used by that judge?<br /><br />11.

The author is always objective, and his sourcing would seem to be impeccable. For the most part he uses sources who will speak on the record, and when they would not he claims to have verified what they've said with others. And source notes and a bibliography are provided.<br /><br />In Mr. Mnookin's version, the story focuses on what happens to people who make wrong choices that they easily could have avoided--that is, if they were not the prisoners of their own ideology and life experiences. The account starts with the misguided notion of New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. that the head of the op-ed page, Howell Raines, a narcissistic, inflexible left-wing ideologue best known for his invective-laden editorials against, mostly, conservatives, but also Bill Clinton, could function as the newspaper's executive editor, in which position he would be in charge, not of a small group of like-minded ideologues, but of a newsroom with hundreds of employees of varying opinions and, of course, abilities.<br /><br />Generalissimo Raines couldn't function in that job, and in the process of failing he managed to alienate most of the staff while turning the newspaper into the journalistic version of a banana republic, led of course by himself.<br /><br />Then, the author moves on to the equally bizarre decision by Raines and his no. 2, managing editor Gerald Boyd, to send Jayson Blair out on big stories (the DC Sniper, Jessica Lynch). Blair, a dimestore sociopath, fantasist, and substance abuser, had already been warned by his direct supervisors about his job performance, but Raines and Boyd would eventually claim, improbably, not to know of this when the scandal broke.<br /><br />And scandal there would be. Blair would repay their trust in him with plagiarism, after which he graduated to fabrication, and ended up writing stories with out-of-town datelines without ever having left the Times Building on West 43rd St. in New York. (In the process, as Mr. Mnookin outlines, he demonstrated creative uses for cell phones and photo archives.)<br /><br />When Blair was exposed and forced to resign, the Times assembled a group of reporters and editors to investigate every story Blair had written, and the result was the sensational report that appeared in the paper one fateful Sunday in May 2003.<br /><br />That report made the Times the butt of jokes, and within two months Raines and Boyd were fired; then, after a brief interregnum in which the previous executive editor, Joe Lelyveld, who Raines disdained, returned to pick up the shattered pieces, Sulzberger selected Bill Keller, who had been passed over in favor of Raines two years before. Keller moved rapidly to restore order and institute changes, among them the hiring of the Times's first public editor.<br /><br />As for Mr. Sulzberger, he escaped unscathed--which is unsurprising: his family owns the New York Times Corp.<br /><br />The book is compulsive reading. Even though the outcome is known, \\"Hard News\\" nevertheless has the feel of a police procedural. Maybe you'll start imagining who might be cast as the principals if (or should I say when) there's a movie made of this cautionary tale.with plagiarism, after which he graduated to fabrication, and ended up writing stories with out-of-town datelines without ever having left the Times Building on West 43rd St. in New York.

I'm beginning to wonder if kinesiology isn't as absolute as Dr. Hawkins claims. Don't get me wrong. I find his writings on the subject of spirituality as fascinating and as accurate as I can imagine. His spiritual teachings strongly resonate within me. I also greatly appreciate the sections with calibrations of religion, spiritual teachings, and spiritual teachers. <br /> <br />However, as a moderately liberal person, I find his use of kinesiology as a means to certify his political position more than a little crass. Despite the fact that he carefully assures that the calibrations don't represent his political views, he proceeds to \\"explain\\" the results of his research and in doing so reveals that, yes, they are most *definitely* his views! This is part of what I find rather disingenuous - even though I find I agree with 95% of his dissertations on the problems of society and its lack of responsibility and victim/perpetrator scenarios. The difference being that he seems to be blaming it almost entirely on liberal views. <br /> <br />Realistically, it seems highly unlikely to me that any specific political position can be 100% right or wrong. Yet Dr. Hawkins' research appears to be saying exactly the opposite. Apparently, conversatives are right - 100% right, absolutely correct, not a chance of error there at all! Uh-huh! <br /> <br />In fact, every single political and social calibration seems to validate the positions of conservatives on...well...everything! Liberal views are just flat out inferior in every way, socially, fiscally, domestically, foreign policy-wise. Just name a way, and they are inferior. <br /> <br />Sorry, but that just seems a little extreme to me. <br /> <br />I know I was capable of influencing the results of kinesiology whenever, at least, the results were deeply personal. My brother and I tried to produce my own calibration level. It resulted in the most random and unpredictable results of the entire session - while everything else we did could be and was independently verified as completely accurate! Perhaps Dr. Hawkins' own personal presence is so strong that his own personal opinion (as a life-long octogenarian conservative) influences the results of his own students. However, that might be considered \\"sophistry\\" in his argument. <br /> <br />After all, his results seem to contradict the teachings and views of many other enlightened teachers (many of whom are verified as enlightened by his own calibrations), including my own guru - Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev. <br /> <br />Not only that, his own calibrations of the chapters on politics and society calibrate much lower than most other chapters on spirituality, albeit still within the level of enlightenment (600+). <br /> <br />My conclusion is simply this: when one is talking about the spirit and of God, it is easier to calibrate a universal truth. The deeper one delves into the realms of duality, the more and more subjective the results become. In any case, regardless of what political view is the subject, they calibrate with integrity unless of an extreme nature. In addition, his results equally condemn fascism and right-wing fundamentalism. This at least partially reassures me that he is on a \\"middle path\\" as the Buddha suggests. <br /> <br />Therefore, I've decided to take his political chapters with a grain of salt and generally skim past the political aspects of his book, having read them once, and concentrate on his spiritual teachings, as well as the teachings of my own teacher. After all, I didn't get into a spiritual life to follow politics, but instead to transcend the dualistic game-playing of the majority of society. <br /> <br />If his book is helpful to some people because of its political views, then I'm glad, but generally speaking, it was probably a mistake to delve into the territory at all, as I suspect it will divide and turn more people away than it will unify or invite.	2005-09-03

In fact, it doesn't even really provide any real cures. But then again, the reality is that if cures could be found in over-the-counter supplements or home remedies summed up conveniently in books, everyone would have been cured by now (right?). And the whole argument that the FDA or any other federal organization is conspiring to keep people hooked onto prescription drugs is old hat, not to mention highly convenient. Trudeau makes sweeping claims about products that have never been scientifically studied or verified for efficacy, and uses red herrings in order to divert the reader's attention away from these major deficits.  The book fails to provide any concrete substantiation of any of its claims. Furthermore, the fact that one is alerted to the possibility of subscribing to a commercial website to obtain further information is suggestive of the possibility that the book is merely an advertising vehicle for the author's (numerous) business ventures. The author was banned by the FTC in 2004 from making any more advertisements for unsubstantiated products, on television or otherwise.  The only redeeming quality of this book is its overall message that traditional medicines aren't your only alternatives. But to jump from that to making a claim that \\"they don't want you to know\\" [how to cure yourself], the \\"they\\" being the \\"medical establishment\\", is ridiculous and completely misleading.  However, if you do have a serious medical condition, especially something like liver or heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc., don't buy this book- or any material like it- because it really does not provide you any cures. Talk to your doctor, talk to friends, talk to people who have gone through what you are going through, become a wise consumer and become an expert about your own body. Being well informed (and that means NOT being misled) will allow you to make better decisions about your health.  The power ofhope is an amazing thing, but false hope can be truly destructive.	2005-08-31

They are all painfully formulaic:  Say something about the book that is being reviewed and then put in an effusive plug for \\"Behind the Dark Curtain\\".  If you look at enough of them, it becomes obvious that they were all written by the same person.        What about those glowing reviews you saw in the editorial review section?  You might be impressed by them until you go looking for the publications they supposedly came from.  Can you find \\"The Antioch Big Time\\" through Google?  How about \\"The Chicago Blitz\\" (besides references to a historical sports team)?  This tactic has been tried before.  You might want to Google \\"David Manning\\" to learn more about this approach to sales.         So, if you can't trust the authenticity of reviews, how do you decide which books are worth purchasing?  One method that Amazon has provided for authenticating reviews is the \\"Real Name\\" label.  It means that Amazon has verified the person's name using a credit card.  Of course, this doesn't mean that you will agree with the reviewer.  It does, however, mean that two reviews from two different \\"real names\\" are actually from two different people, as opposed to the glowing reviews and plugs for this book which were clearly written by the same person writing under different pseudonyms.  It's a shame that the effort that went into this deceptive marketing campaign wasn't instead directed at correcting the numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the book.

This has been verified by many researches today including Patrick Harding of Sheffield, James Bursenos, James Arthur, Rogan Tyler and others.  It's a great reference in regard to the history of Christmas and whom developed which Christmas icon when.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Highfield, around page 109 at the start of Ch. 6, takes us on a detour of obesity, proper diet, genes, DNA, etc., using this as an opportunity to talk about this philosophy of diet for the next 20 pages, forgetting that he already stated Santa Claus is the mushroom, and \\"obesity\\" would then obviously be due to the mushroom's round shape. Never mind this detail. We're taken away on an excursion only indirectly related to the Christmas theme. It was also around this point that I noticed that the book also tends to repeat itself, and topics out of order, going back to things two or three times to talk about them with different concepts, while seeming to ignore those already discussed.  <br /> <br />For the first 108 pages, the book was grippingly fascinating. Then on page 126 it happens. Highfield throws all logic out the window and takes us on a slide down the slippery path of literalism. At this point I was expecting him to say something juxtaposed to what he had already stated about Santa Claus and say that the man really did fly in a sleigh pulled by reindeer with a bag of toys.  <br /> <br />I'll help Mr. Highfield for his search of the star Bethlehem here: <br /> <br />There were 7 planets, not including the earth, which was thought to be the center of the universe. The planets were Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, the Moon and the Sun. The sun was placed as the head of the sky god's penis, and Saturn, the highest planet, the \\"Most High God\\". He was called El, or Yahweh. All of the planets are depicted as their god names in our names of the days of the week.  <br /> <br />Sonne's day (Sun-day) is Sunday; Mond's day (Moon-day) is Monday (Spanish: Lunes); Tiu's day (Mars) is Tuesday; Woden's Day (Mercury) is Wednesday; Thor's day (Jupiter) is Thursday; Freya's day (Venus) is Friday; and Saturn's day is Saturday, the Sabbath. This is where our names for the days of the week came from.  <br /> <br />Jesus was the sun in the sky, worshiped on \\"sun-day\\" who is born annually on Dec. 25. He dies and is resurrected on the celestial cross, which is the cross of the solstices and equinoxes. Dec. 21/22 is the Winter Solstice (and the first day of winter), this is the shortest day of the year. Above the 66.5 degree latitude, the sun actually DISAPPEARS for three days...completely. Though it is still light outside. The sun dies, or does not change in degrees for three days, from Dec. 21 to Dec. 25, here, god's SUN is \\"in a tomb\\" (the chthonic realm/under world), from which he resurrects. The SUN is born of the VIRGIN called VIRGO on Dec. 25. The Three wise-men (the Belt of Orion) form the path to the star Sirius (Bethlehem). At midnight Virgo sticks her head over the horizon. Several hours later she steps on the head of the serpent (the constellation Serpens) with her right foot. Shortly after, the SUN, GOD's LIGHT and saving grace is born between her legs. We are \\"saved\\" for another year... the sun again begins heading north 1 degree each day for the next six months, saving us from the darkest, coldest time of year.  <br /> <br />At the end of winter, we celebrate the return of GOD's sun by celebrating EAST STAR (Easter) fertility worship. The goddess Ishtar/Astarte, from which Easter is derived, was the fertility/star goddess celebrated at the death of winter, at the first day of Spring (= life, springs back to life), March 20/21. How do we know when to celebrate EAST-STAR SUN-Rise services on which Sun-Day? We wait for the vernal equinox, then wait for the next Pascal full moon, then we celebrate East Star Sun Rise on the following SUN-day. This day happens to be approx 9 months before the next BIRTH of the sun on the following Dec. 25.  <br /> <br />For ancient people, this was a method of tracking time. Today we use clocks and caledars. Ancient times used the sky. To not know these very basic principles of the facts of our cosmos meant certain death. If you didn't understand these things, you didn't know when to plant, harvest, store, etc. It was survival to know this information or you DIED.  <br /> <br />Some place along the path of history, some devious and deceitful people got the idea to MURDER people who refused to take the story as literal history. Eventually, all of the people who understood the astronomical truth of the story were killed. This time was called the Inquisition. Everyone who questioned the Church was murdered. Every time the Churched murdered, they got richer by acquiring the property of the \\"heretic\\". It was a win, win for the Church. <br /> <br />At this point the book got so thick that I just scanned it and jumped ahead to page 155 and read about snow. I put the book down when he began talking about alcoholism and the Christmas spirit (page 186 ch. 9)... I'd already seen how he took that detour on obesity and I'm not a drinker, so I'll skip it. I doubt I'll ever finish the rest of the book, though I do recommend it for reference purposes, and, to look up how to cook a turkey, or make pudding. If for nothing else, buy it just for the first 108 pages... that alone is worth the read.  <br />	2005-08-28

Absolutism has bad consequences. 2. Different cultures have different values. 3. Values are socially conditioned. 4. Relativism gives people freedom. 5. Relativism is tolerant. 6. Morality is relative to changing situations. 7. Morality is relative to changing intentions. 8. Morality can be explained by evolution as a survival device.<br /><br />As a moral relativist, even I find that not one of these is a worthwhile argument in favor of moral relativism, and thus \\"refuting\\" them is completely beside the point.<br /><br />Kreeft either ignores or is ignorant of the core of the true relativist challenge: the need to provide objective support for a claim to have an absolute foundation for moral values. Kreeft certainly can't. His argument in favor of absolutism rests primarily on what he calls the data of moral experience, which comes down to the claim that \\"Conscience immediately detects real right and wrong, just as your senses immediately detect real colors and shapes.\\" He believes that this proves that absolutism is \\"scientific\\" and empirically verified. He doesn't realize that two distinct propositions are involved. The following Proposition A is obviously true: Peter Kreeft believes he has a faculty--a conscience--that can immediately, absolutely, and objectively detect right and wrong. The following Proposition B is not necessarily true: Peter Kreeft has a faculty--a conscience--that can immediately, absolutely, and objectively detect right and wrong. The truth of Proposition A might be considered self-evident, even \\"scientific,\\" if by that one means that it's based on experience and evidence (if Kreeft says he has a particular belief, it's reasonable to acknowledge, lacking strong evidence to the contrary, that he does have that belief), but Kreeft never addresses why Proposition B should be considered true (i.e., that hisbelief is correct).<br /><br />In other words, Kreeft believes that just as he can know that the sky is blue merely by opening his eyes, so too he can know whether any given moral proposition is true or false just by considering it and allowing his conscience to come to an unmediated instant perception of its rightness or wrongness. His claim that this ability to make judgments that he believes are absolute proves that absolutism is \\"scientific\\" shows what a poor guide he is to moral philosophy.<br /><br />Kreeft's view seems to be that he and Christians like him with the proper interpretation of the revelation to Abraham and its subsequent revisions (\\"God [came] down to Abraham with the real religion\\") have a way of knowing when a moral position is objectively correct, but he fails to mention what guarantees the correctness of his organ of moral judgment, which leads me to assume that he knows his conscience is correct because he knows his conscience is correct.<br /><br />Here's an example of how Kreeft, who claims that his book offers \\"respectable logical arguments\\" from a \\"clear and very intelligent\\" viewpoint, in fact abuses language and logic. To defend the idea that changing situations \\"change how you should apply the rules, but they don't change the rules,\\" he gives the example of lying to a Nazi searching for hidden Jews: \\"The Nazis had no right to know that truth\\" so it wasn't wrong to \\"deceive\\" them. \\"Lying is always wrong, and that wasn't wrong, so that wasn't a lie.\\" To safeguard the absoluteness of the rule that says \\"Lying is always wrong,\\" Kreeft redefines \\"lying\\" from \\"the speaking of a falsehood\\" to \\"the speaking of a falsehood when it's not permissible to do so,\\" and so the rule becomes \\"The speaking of a falsehood when it is not permissible to do so is wrong.\\" Besides the irony in a professed absolutist ignoring the common meaning of a word to suit his purpose--and in particular redefining \\"lie\\" in defense of a belief in absolute truth--this raises the problem of how we're to judge, by objective standards, when \\"speaking a falsehood\\" is permissible and therefore not lying; otherwise, this rule is completely empty. If his semantic juggling is to be of any use, Kreeft's needs to prove that he has objective standards for making such a judgment, and he fails to. In fact, Kreeft's arguments in favor of absolutism are as follows:<br /><br />1. Absolutism has better consequences.<br /><br />The issue of whether relativism or absolutism has better consequences is irrelevant to the question of which view is correct, and, besides, it simply brings us back to the initial problem of deciding which moral framework to use in weighing what consequence in a given situation is  \\"better.\\"<br /><br />2. Common consensus: \\"nearly everyone who has ever lived has been a moral absolutist.\\"<br /><br />He acknowledges that this is only a \\"probable,\\" not a conclusive argument. It's hard to see what this could prove, even probably, even if were true. A majority vote doesn't establish something as eternally valid.<br /><br />3. Moral experience. \\"The first and foundational moral experience we have is always absolutistic. Only later do you get relativism--later in the life of the individual or of the society ... we can all remember what moral experience was like before we became sophisticated. It was absolute.\\"<br /><br />Children are told what they must and must not do; early societies ruled by priests and kings laid down the law and demanded obedience. What this proves is that people and societies are told that moral rules are absolute; it doesn't prove that they actually are.<br /><br />4. How we use moral language.<br /><br />a. According to C. S. Lewis, we speak as though we believe that there are moral absolutes.<br /><br />Even if it were true that \\"we\\" (and who are these \\"we\\"?) speak in this way, it wouldn't prove that the things spoken of actually exist.<br /><br />b. Kreeft follows Lewis in claiming that, in essence, all moral arguments are about how to apply, in particular situations, what everyone agrees are certain universal, objective, and unchanging principles.<br /><br />In addition to the weakness already mentioned of basing conclusions about the actual nature of something on how \\"we\\" supposedly talk about it, this version of the assertion relies on an appeal to principles \\"everyone\\" supposedly agrees on. In fact, it turns out that by \\"everyone,\\" apologists like Kreeft and Lewis mean people with values close enough to theirs for those people to be considered morally competent or reasonable. What they're really saying is, \\"Everyone agrees on what is right and wrong, except for people who disagree with me, and such individuals or groups can be discounted because their views are obviously unacceptable to reasonable people like me,\\" which begs too many questions to support an argument for the existence of common principles.<br /><br />That's pretty much the substance of Kreeft's \\"refutation.\\" He also throws in quite a bit of invective against people and principles he disagrees with, but he never addresses the following question: What are your objective, universal, and timeless reasons for claiming that your foundation for absolute values is true? This failure, taken in conjunction with the rest of Kreeft's falsely triumphal performance, raises the question of just what qualifications are required to teach philosophy at Boston College.	2005-08-27

I got this book because it's supposed to be the \\"must have\\" for all pregnant women. While I found many things in it that answered some of my questions, and the book was helpful in establishing the benchmarks for each month, I found information in it that was FALSE. This concerned me, as it is supposed to be reviewed and ok'd by doctors. The \\"best odds diet\\" is not only impossible to follow, but has very little in it that is accurate when it comes to measuring portion sizes (something I learned when I had to go on a restricted diet). There was a section on excercise and what not to do, and the book adviced against stretching the inner thighs... well, I'm a dancer, and stretching is what I do, and it's actually very helpful during labor, unlike what the book said (I also verified this with my OB). These two examples were enough for me to wonder how much more in the book was inaccurate, and to bring it down from a \\"must have\\" to an ok read, if you take it with a grain of salt. It's not bad, but it isn't the ultimate authority like every one else makes it to be. Borrow it if you can. I eventually put mine aside and stopped reading it altogether.	2005-08-25

But there is a fact page and it does present 'experts' of history presenting the 'truth' of Christianity. So how is one to find out if Brown is in any way correct in the assertions made by his characters in the book? Well, reading Ehrman's book is a good start though I think most will want to dig deeper after your interest is whetted further. <br /> <br />Ehrman, with ease, explains the true picture of Constantine (much less of the bogeyman that Brown and others want us to think). He expains the history of how the Bible got put togethor. He explains the whole marriage to mary and feminine fiasco. And in all cases, Brown's characters are terribly wrong and unjustified in what they say.  <br /> <br />Now, I take it that Ehrman is not a Christian and hence his language and premises may irk some readers. Since his view is supposedly the historical view, he only uses certain gospel passages as historical (ones that can be independanly verified). He goes on to say that some passages were deliberatly altered for the times but does not give examples of how or why. He does not outrightly deny the miracle passages but from the tone of his voice it sounds like he wants beg the question that since these miracles are outrageous stories, they could not have possibly been written down at the time they happened by their witnesses. In any case, the book should motivate a person to study more into this fascinating area of history. I for one, will be reading more on the conception of Christianity and the New Testament. This is a secular account of the time, now it would be interesting to see a Christian account for it.  <br /> <br />I think many Christians will feel vindicated by some Ehrman's history and disturbed by other parts of his claims. However, all the more reason to look into these question further. Ehrman wanted people to be interested in history and I think he achieved that goal. <br /> <br />	2005-08-23

This little book provides all of the information necessary to invest wisely and successfully.  So many other books treat investing as a complex activity where success can only be reached with the skills and knowledge of the author.  This book uses an opposite approach of supplying  just the essentials.  Yet the straightforward steps given are verified by academics and proven in practice.  The motivation for this investing style is described and contrasted with the general advice from the investing industry.  Clear examples and concrete recommendations are given. <br /> <br />It is tempting for one to read this book in one sitting and say \\"Is that all there is?\\".  Many people feel investing should be more complicated than this.  Yet, it is the easy, clear, and simple approach outlined in this book that gives superior results. <br /> <br />After losing a fortune in recent years attempting to invest by chasing recent performance, I now realize how simple it is to accept the gains from the entire stock market with little effort and much less expense.

First some background: I recently recerted my CCIE R&S by passing the security written exam. I used this book, Maalik's, and the Cisco website. I own and like a wallfull of other Cisco books. I work daily with the security technologies making up the subject matter. <br /> <br />This book was unfortunately not very useful. I must say I passed _in spite_ of it. The numerous severe errors make it impossible to really rely on. <br /> <br />I started with pretty high hopes, given it was a fresh 2nd edition, naively thinking the bugs would be worked out... Not so. It's full of really bad factual errors, generally unclear and muddled. Lots of fluff, maybe trying to mask the fact this book was seemingly rushed into print, and the tech editing rather useless. <br /> <br />The questions on the CD are contradictory, the answers not matching (i.e. extra choices appearing or not available in the \\" correct\\" answers), and verified right answers scored as wrong. I was actually pretty upset at Cisco Press for having let this one slip into the stores. <br /> <br />Save your money... Get Saadat Malik's instead, and possibly also Convery's books.

Apparently the authors of Cool Woods do not care to be any more critical, but with less excuse.  Notable is their illogical argument claiming the Boreal Forests are the \\"Lungs of the Earth\\"    The phrase \\"Lungs of the Earth\\" was originally coined to describe the ecological position of Rainforests, but even that application is wrong.  It is far more likely that the top 200 metres of the oceans serve that function.  Such facts can be verified scientifically, if one were to do the work.  Drake and Love have not.    Indeed, Drake (an activist with Pollution Probe in Toronto) and Love even provide information that should cause an alert reader to question their preservationist position.  They describe the boreal forest saying, \\"If you walked around the world through the boreal forest, you'd find few roads\\".  Yet, taking its lead from the book, their publisher's review says, \\"Despite our reliance on it, we have placed the \\"lungs of the earth\\" under siege with clear-cutting, acid rain, and even radioactivity.\\"  If the Boreal Forest is in such need of preservation, how can both arguments really be true?    They treat the philosophical principles that underpin their Environmentalist position as foregone conclusions never daring to state them explicitly.  Do they realize it is too abstract for their young readers, preferring instead to indoctrinate them with half truths and feelgood claims about the very real beauty of the Boreal Forest (Love has done a good job in that respect) or are they trying not to alert their target audience?     The implicit message, again and again, is that Mankind must be subordinated to Nature, and our actions should be curtailed accordingly.  That addresses a very fundamental question of philosophy: Do Humans have the right to exist on their own terms?  In \\"Cool Woods\\" Drake and Love are telling your children they do not have that right!	2005-08-15

Although Dr. John Hagelin's expertise and accomplishments are in quantum physics the knowledge of this work will change the discipline of social science forever.  In fact in almost all cases academia and governments have been ineffective and impotent before the great problems of war, terrorism, and crime. [as well as poor health and a polluted environment]  Manual for A Perfect Government reveals a startling solution for eliminating violence and damage at its core.  This is no ivory tower theory- the data and practical research put forth here is impeccable.<br /><br />Dr. Hagelin simplifies the myriad of problems we all face as humans.  In a nutshell, he emphasises it is the violation of natural law that is creating the deterioration of our world.  Purifying collective consciousness and harnessing the laws of nature through the use of the technology of the unified field is an idea whose time has come. As Dr. Hagelin points out the unified field which Einstein dreamed of finding [and whose existence was proved in subsequent years by scientists] is millions of times more powerful than the nuclear field; and it can only be used for peaceful purposes, there are no side effects.  This field had its origins in the ancient Vedic culture. Now this field of pure consciousness discovered and utilized by Vedic scientists thousands of years ago is substantiated and verified by modern science.  Dr. Hagelin in his book systematically and concretely maps out how we can markedly turn the tide on the most pressing problems of our times and transform the world into a higher quality of life for all.	2005-08-14

Perhaps music or graphics or video or text? Or combinations thereof. If so, then Seitz suggests that you should be concerned about protecting your content. Especially given the continued rise of peer to peer networks like Kazaa, Morpheus or Napster. These have been responsible for massive unauthorised copying of music. It is also expected that video copying will increase as more users get broadband and computers with bigger disks to store the video.<br /><br />Seitz explains various methods of embedding a discreet watermark into your content. In such a way that it does not degrade, say, the visual or audio aspects of the content. But so that if you or your agent comes across a file with suspected unauthorised content of yours, then this can be easily verified by checking the watermark.<br /><br />Of course, someone on the other side can try to remove the watermark. So much of the complexity of watermarking revolves around trying to defeat this.<br /><br />Seitz offers his book not just to a programmer who might write the watermarking code, but also to the author or artist who creates the content.

However, there are a few golden nuggets scattered throughout the book.  The main purpose of the book is to address the sources of depression in women, as identified through questionnaires filled out by over 5,000 women attendees at Family Life Seminars.  According to the survey, the sources of depression in women are (in order of most troublesome to least troublesome): low self-esteem; fatigue and time pressure; loneliness, isolation, and boredom; absence of romantic love in marriage; financial difficulties; sexual problems in marriage; menstrual and physiological problems; problems with the children; aging; and in-law problems.<br /><br />You can see that the sources of depression in women weren't radically different in 1977 as compared to today.  So while the book has some dated attitudes and ideas, it is possible to derive insight from the reading.  Each chapter contains anecdotes and Dobson's observations, and ends with a question and answer section.<br /><br />One of the sections that I found interesting was Dobson's suggestions on how wives can \\"teach\\" their husbands about women's emotional needs.  Instead of nagging, Dobson says to plan the timing, setting, and manner to focus on your needs and desires rather than his inadequacies and shortcomings.  Dobson also has an extended section that examines popular ideas about the meaning of 'love', and another section where he gives tips on how husbands can enhance sensuality in situations where the wife's sex drive is inhibited for whatever reason (and Dobson discusses a short list of reasons).  Finally, there is a fascinating section on the emotional and physical symptoms of estrogen deprivation (I would love for this section to be verified or updated by current medical knowledge).<br /><br />--Lynellen.com	2005-08-02

Don't waste your money nor your time on this work.  If you want to read a real history of the life and times of Papa Pacelli, read Rabbi David G. Dalin's [[ASIN:0895260344 The Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII And His Secret War Against Nazi Germany]], written not by a failed Catholic, but by an observant Jew who became indignant at the soiling of Pope Pius XII's name, and who set out to set the record straight.    Consider the following before you dump your money into this travesty:    *A major response to Hitler's Pope came from University of Mississippi law professor Ronald J. Rychlak in his 2000 book on the subject, Hitler, the War, and the Pope. Rychlak was acknowledged by the Vatican to have been given special access to their closed archives for his research.[citation needed]    *Rychlak disagreed with Cornwell's claim of having found a \\"time bomb letter\\", arguing that the letter in question had actually been written not by Pacelli but by his assistant, and moreover had been fully published and discussed in a 1992 book by Emma Fattorini (a highly respected docent at the University of Rome).[18] With respect to Cornwell's allegations of antisemitism, Rychlak stated that \\"When Pius XII died in 1958, there were tributes from virtually every Jewish group around the world\\".    *Rychlak also alleged that Cornwell manipulated the photograph on the front cover of the American edition of the book, and incorrectly dated the photo as having been taken in March 1939, the month that Pacelli was made Pope. Rychlak charged that this had been deliberately in order to give the impression that Pius had just visited Hitler when, in fact, the photo had been taken in 1927 as Pius was leaving a reception held for German President Paul von Hindenburg.[21] Robert Royal has also repeated this allegation.    *In his 2005 book The Myth of Hitler's Pope, the historian and rabbi David G. Dalin countered Cornwell.[23] Dalin suggested that Yad Vashem should honor Pope Pius XII as a \\"Righteous Gentile,\\" concluding that \\"[t]he anti-papal polemics of ex-seminarians like Garry Wills and John Cornwell...of ex-priests like James Carroll, and or other lapsed or angry liberal Catholics exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today.\\" Dalin called the book's conclusions \\"unverified\\" and \\"strongly anti-religious\\".[25] Eugene Fisher, who has a PhD in Hebrew culture and education, said it was a \\"sad commentary on the secular media that this anti-Catholic screed was ever published\\".    *In the book The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, Philip Jenkins said that Hitler's Pope, along with anti-Catholic conspiracy theories and other \\"anti-Church historical polemic\\", belongs to the pseudohistory category of books about anti-Catholic \\"mythic history\\", historical manipulation, and national demonization, such as the Black Legend about Spain, said that publishers publish such books because the sell many copies, not because they mean to \\"destroy or calumniate Catholicism\\".    *Ken Woodward, writing in Newsweek, stated that Hitler's Pope has \\"errors of fact and ignorance of context [that] appear on almost every page.\\"    Source: [...] - Check the footnotes to read the primary sources.	2005-07-31
US	43351627	RLPHQ85T0DBDY	0801483042	482618982	Sex and Society in the World of the Orthodox Slavs 900–1700	Books	3	25	28	N	N	Lots of Good Information; Some Unsubstantiated Speculation	Everything that Eve Levin says in this book may be true. It *may* all be true: but she certainly doesn't establish all of her premises persuasively. Sometimes, she doesn't even try to (I can only assume that she thinks that the evidence speaks for itself). Obviously, if you disagree with someone's premises, you are going to question their conclusions. Thus, while Eve Levin gives mountains of good information in this book, the reader is left having doubts as to whether her conclusions are correct. Three of the premises that particularly bugged me: <br /> <br />1. Levin constantly states that the Slavs considered sex and even sexual thoughts to be evil in and of themselves, and to be due to Satanic (or demonic) influence. As an Orthodox Christian who has read a number of books on the subject from various perspectives (secular, Catholic, Orthodox),  I have never once came upon this type of claim. The Church Fathers normally considered the most strict on sexual matters (Bl. Augustine, St. Gregory the Diagolist, etc.) certainly never went so far as to say that sex was in itself evil. At most, they said that sex was a minor sin.  <br /> <br />Eastern Fathers, for the most part, were not even as strict as this (this can be verified on any number of sexual issues, from priestly celibacy to the importance of condemning contraception in canonical literature). While the west followed, to a large extent, Augustine's views on sexuality, the East followed, to a large extent, the more \\"moderate\\"  St. John Chrysostom, who spoke approvingly of sex being pleasurable, sexual attraction being natural, etc. (David Ford's book on St. John Chrysostom provides  a good examination of these issues).  And, Levin herself says that St. John was the most popular preacher/homilist among the Slavs. So where does the idea that sexuality was inherently evil come from? *Maybe* it's true, but if it is, it would have to have been within the scope of her study (after the year 900, about sexuality, etc.), so why no evidence? <br /> <br />2. The second premise that Levin works from is that all (or most) of the sexual beliefs that the Slavs had were built around protecting the good of society, even if to the detriment of the good of the individual. Again, this may very well be true, but no evidence is given in a systematic fashion to demonstrate this. This is an important point because it could greatly effect how a modern Orthodox reader would view the information found, and also effect how applicable the information is to our own present-day context.  <br /> <br />3. the third premise that bugged me was her statement that \\"modern Western society has accepted as axiomatic the propsition that sexuality is innate. The medieval Orthodox Slavs rejected this view.\\" (p. 13)  Ok, so maybe they did. What evidence is there for this? The only evidence we are given are the canons and literature quoted later on other topics. In other words, no direct attempt is made to demonstrate the premise. But how can we believe that the premise is correct, solely by her reading the premise into various canons and penitential literature and then basing conclusions on that information? How do we know whether it is eisegesis or exegesis? We don't. <br /> <br />Now, with these exceptions, I thought the book was good. I felt like Levin was a bit condescending (or patronizing) at times, though for the most part I found her to be suprisingly willing to look for answers that could explain what she was discussing. It would have been easy to just give a straight exposition of the subject, and leave it at that. But Levin (with the 3 above exceptions) seemed willing to do deeper. Left simply as black and white, many of the Slavic practices (e.g., having a raped girl marry her rapist)  would come off as hideous and profoundly sick to modern ears (though fwiw, the Mosaic law enforced the same practice of a young girl marrying the man who raped her--Deut. 22:28-29). But Levin attempts to give informationthat helps to put the practices into their proper historical context.  <br /> <br />And an extra star can be given here just for the sheer amount of information that Levin gives. I estimated that the book comes in at somewhere over a hundred thousand words, and it's an information-packed hundred thousand at that.  Some more information on certain points would have been nice, but in the end she provides more information than you could possibly handle at one time (or with one read). It was also very interesting to read about how Orthodox Christians of the past treated issues like menstrual periods, nocturnal emissions, abstaining from sex before receiving the eucharist, etc. Obviously this is not information that is easy to find, but it is interesting reading (if you find such historical things interesting). <br /> <br />For anyone who is interested in sexuality from an Orthodox perspective, this book would be a must read. In fact, it is probably an even bigger must-read than the oft-quoted John Noonan book on Contraception (Noonan himself makes some unsubstantiated speculations, like that the early Church's view on contraception was based primarily on stoic philosophy). Interestingly, though, Noonan's newest book, A Church That Can and Cannot Change, is a good one to read in companion with Levin's, because in that book Noonan discusses the possibility of a development of moral doctrine, which is quite relevant when meditating on Levin's information.	2005-07-26

US	49168185	RY6LE911NJ2JJ	0891418725	258042866	First In: An Insider's Account of How the CIA Spearheaded the War on Terror in Afghanistan	Books	5	4	5	N	N	An Authentic Account That Should be Required Reading in Washington	I could not put the book down after beginning to read it. It is very well written and authentic. Its authenticity is verified by my many Afghan friends here in Saudi Arabia, not that I questioned its authenticity. The descriptions of the many challenges of interpersonal relationships mingled with politics and battle scenes make it a very excitable read. The part dealing with the BLU-82s (not referred by the author, but known in the media as the \\"Daisy Cutter\\") 15,000 lb bomb on pages 335-336 gives the reader the enormous power of the weapon and the many aerial assaults by the U.S. Air Force and Navy that broke the back of the Taliban and won the conflict. Of course the Northern Alliance and other tribal factions were fighting the land battle, but that effort would not have been successful with the air raids. The \\"Daisy Cutter\\", introduced in Vietnam, received publicity during the Afghan conflict, but the author's story is the first that I know of describing its actual use in Afghanistan. I felt it was one of the highlights of the book. <br /> <br />The author complained about diarrhea and his partner suffering from flatulence on pages 108-109, and throughout the book. I am surprised that the government doctors did not give a medication called Lomotil, which is used for this condition. The doctors in the U.S. gave us this medication when I was working in the jungles of Brazil where diarrhea was quite common. The medication worked wonders for everyone. The description of Doc using chlorine for athletes foot cure on page 84 is a new one on me. The toilets the author described are very common throughout the Middle East and Asia. <br /> <br />While the book was entertaining to read, it contains some very serious issues that need to be addressed. The author concludes in the Afterword that the war is not over and that Iraq is a distraction from Afghanistan and Pakistan to finish the job against terrorist groups namely bin Laden and Al-Qa'ida. His warnings need to be heededin Washington and London. The author concludes on page 363 that the Iraq war is a problem for which no clear solution exists. He states that U.S. military Special Forces units were with drawn from Afghanistan and sent to Iraq, resulting in less experienced U.S. forces that concentrate on destructive searches of Afghan homes and frightening women and children. Such actions will alienate the Afghan population in these critical regions. <br /> <br />This book does the CIA justice, an agency battered by many, especially some politicians who led to its demise by lack of funding. In fairness, the CIA was at fault to some extent for its problems. The author indicates a very clear perspective that surprisingly reflects the views of the Arab world. The author refutes the argument that the war in Iraq was to fight terrorism, because of the negative consequences that followed in the war on terror. It is a general consensus in the Middle East, which the war in Iraq was waged largely for gaining assets to Iraqi oil. Iraq is second behind Saudi Arabia in oil reserves.  <br />Of course the author was not in Afghanistan for religious reasons, nor was religion his concern. He makes it clear that it is important to understand a country's culture and history, and religion is an integral part of this mix in the Islamic world. The term \\"Islam Fundamentalism\\", albeit being so popular in the West, is a classic case of a Western term being applied erroneously to an Eastern culture. By definition all Muslims are fundamentalists, because they believe in the Koran to the letter. In the West, dominated by people of Christian belief, there are Christians of liberal interpretation of the Bible and those who interpret the Bible to the letter. The latter we differentiate from the former by the term \\"Christian Fundamentalists.\\" Then we apply this term mistakenly to Islam as \\"Islam Fundamentalism\\", when describing the conservative elements of Islam. We should be saying \\"Islamic extremists\\", or \\"Islamic radicals\\", who are very different in behavior from Christian Fundamentalists (I am not saying either that Christian Fundamentalists are \\"radicals\\" or \\"extremists\\"). I have had this term \\"Islam Fundamentalism\\" verified as incorrect by Muslims all over the Middle East and countless readings about Islam. Many leading politicians, members of the media, and the \\"Middle East experts\\" that appear on TV in the West, use this term in error. Also the author on page 205 refers to the 40th day celebrations that are an important milestone in the mourning cycle in Islam. This is not true in Islam. The practice is that three days are allowed for morning. So this 40th day must have been a local tradition. <br /> <br />What the author brilliantly shows is that Al-Qa'ida knows that it cannot recruit members from the vast majority of Muslims, so it tries to drive a wedge between the Muslims and non Muslims to recruit new members from the Muslim community. This is where knowing what Islam is very important. This is not to say to understand Islam is to believe in it, but to bridge a gap to prevent distrust and misunderstandings. For many that may wonder, no I am not a Muslim, but I have lived and worked with the Arabs for many years in Saudi Arabia and I know Mr. Schroen has some dire warnings that better not be ignored. I highly recommend this book for everyone, including the U.S. President. <br />	2005-07-23

Why a <br />westerner shopping on amazon.com should consider a living avatar <br />vis-a-vis the #1 cause of cancer? Because by having a divine view <br />of mundane matters (debatable premise, admittedly: sathyasai.org) <br />He can point out from His perspective aspects which we would not <br />consider to be important. In this case, it is the BONES that stay <br />within the refined sugar after the process of chemically removing <br />'impurities' from raw cane (or beet?) that are the number 1 cause <br />of cancer. He mentions that tobacco and poluution come a distant <br />second in being causative agents. The bone particles are present <br />even in so-called brown or turbinado sugar, which is white with <br />some molasses added back. He suggests the alternative JAGGERY to <br />sweeten meals without the refined sugars. There's one point which <br />He typically inserts as a test of backbone: one must decide if a <br />sweet tooth is more important than one's long-term health. I add <br />myself that we can exist without factory sugar (uncivilized folks <br />got along fine without it before white sugar became essential), & <br />sugar supposedly FEEDS cancer cells that seemingly exist (double <br />whammy), whereas OXYGEN supposedly kills cancer cells. Forgive me <br />for throwing in those last two unverified tidbits; nevertheless, <br />since they seem to directly affect cancer cells (feed/kill), and <br />since most folks CAN take control over how much sugar and oxygen <br />enters their system, it seems to me to be worthwhile to tell you. <br /> <br />I regret the say that I haven't the citation from Baba; he stated <br />the connection between cancer and (refined) sugar in 1981, and it <br />appeared in a (very difficult to find online!) 'Summer Showers'. <br />What astonishes me is that devotees of Sai Baba commonly KNOW of <br />this cause-and-effect, yet nothing is being done to spread word.	2005-07-23

Yes we have a new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, as is no suprise. However we also have a new Potions teacher. Aha! The plot thickens (insert theory here).

There was a movie about this premise in the past few months, called 'The Forgotten,' about a woman who remembers having two children but everyone (even her husband) tells her there were no children.  There were, of course, and it was some kind of memory experiment.  Since I saw only the previews, I am not sure how she found the children and how she knew that she was not going crazy. <br /> <br />This story about Abby is quite similar in the fact that nothing is the same after she 'goes home' and everything has been destroyed.  Why, was it a cover up of some kind.  She is a brave woman to go back to the place where she was held in bondage.  I would never dare.  I was held against my wishes six years ago and barely got away alive, but nothing was ever done to the perpetrater even though I gave them his name, the name of his mother, the location of his house where he kept me captive and how I had to run to the neighbors for help.  Any of that could be verified, and yet the local police did nothing. <br /> <br />Another strange happening a few months after that was when a man tried to lure me to his 'apartment' on Magnolia Avenue here in Knox. and I gave the police the code to get in the front door, his phone number, his name and the name of his grandmother where he was when he called me.  A 'friend' had given him my unlisted phone number.  So, I have experienced some of the plot in person and, if the chief of the detectives had not walked me through the whole night (except for a few instances I did not remember), I would have had to go for therapy. <br /> <br />Many novels are based on personal experiences, usually the debut but Ms. French has already written KILLING ME SOFTLY and BENEATH THE SKIN.

I am a Christian (both of which can easily be verified by reading my other reviews). And until I read this book, I wanted to like Dan Quayle. He always seemed like the media's whipping boy, like the guy that couldn't get a fair shake. I remember watching Rush Limbaugh's TV show and seeing Slick Willy laughing at a funeral, and then after spotting a camera instantaneously becoming very sad. I wanted to know why other politicians weren't hounded like Quayle was? <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Dan answered this question in his book: he really is as the media presents him. The media paints Quayle as a guy who's smarter than average, conservative, and something of a mistake-making dufus. I found nothing in the book to refute this portrait. Quayle goes into gaff after goof that he made in a very short time period, and one comes away seeing that, yes, he really does have a problem that would be the death of any politician. Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure Mr. Quayle is much smarter that I will ever be; he's probably also more charismatic, well connected, financially secure, etc.  <br /> <br />But none of these things can save Dan from himself. He's the Yogi Berra of politicians, and you can't blame the media for jumping on the chance to make a few dollars off of his persona. Mr. Quayle's a capitalist and a conservative, surely he understands that? (though, of course, he could point out the hypocrisy in the media's claim to be unbiased, when they have biases just like the rest of us)  <br /> <br />I don't know why, but it seems like conservative politicians--e.g., Quayle, Gingrich, Keyes, etc.--have self-imploded any time they have been given a chance to do well. Meanwhile, conservative pundits--e.g., Limbaugh, Hannity, etc.--have done astronomically well when given the chance. I suppose the Republican party needs another man like Reagan, who can be a bit of everything at the same time, and still come off as seeming like much more than just the sum of his parts. <br /> <br />Whatever the case in real life may be, I do admit that I found this book to be somewhat entertaining (if somewhat self-promoting, as most biographies are). Unfortunately, the let down that came from realising that Quayle had hurt his own case made this book very unlikable in my own eyes. It's never pleasant to see someone shoot themselves in the foot.	2005-07-17

Dawn goes into how we got into the current cultural mess in our society, though given the book's age it is a bit dated as it refers primarily to \\"Boomers\\" (from what I've gathered in other research, the situation is similar for GenX, just worse).  She then critiques the well meaning (I hope) attempts to reach America's dumbed down, short attention span, commitment phobic generation with worship styles that would be attractive to them, no matter the cost to the Gospel.    Dawn critiques not only contemporary worship but traditionalISM as well. She sees the function of worship (quite correctly, I might add) not as means of attracting numbers (AKA \\"worship evangelism\\"), but of having a personal experience with part of God, forming the character of the worshiper, and building community. Both extremes are the antithesis of this.    I have two minor criticisms of this book. Dawn, who I guess has no training in science or technology, tends to present as scientific fact the results of single research studies which appear to be unverified by independent work (to be fair, some are unlikely to be reproduced anytime soon) and might not have had significant peer review. Second she, unlike Long, is a little vague when it comes to solutions, though they seem to be there somewhere. In other words, she can ramble a bit.	2005-07-16

One caveat, which struck me at the start, is that surely footnotes would not have evolved solely form historical research, surely they would have surfaced in more useful contemporary documents, perhaps to do with legal or diplomatic professions.    That apart, Grafton takes the evolution of the footnote in historical scholarship as the evolution of `scientific' methodology in historical research.  On the surface Grafton states that the `the text persuades, the notes prove'. Originally history was story telling by people who claimed to be present, and/or participants, in great events.  As scholarship evolved, the fact that participants might have different motivations, points-of-view and/or explicit biases became increasingly apparent.  \\"Ambassadors' reports - a great source of archival works - report on deliberations to which they did not have direct access and the intentions of monarchs who did not speak frankly\\".  Therefore scholars began to quote their sources by use of footnotes to the main text.    Within this context, Grafton illustrates the distance some scholars will go to, in terms of selective quotation of some sources, the suppression of others and it is this which enlivens a topic which otherwise might have been deathly-dull.  He acknowledges, with  admiration, that some historians use footnotes to allow that there exist contrary interpretations of the thesis they are pursuing.  However his work in the field allows him to allow him to add venom e.g. ` but often they (historians) quietly set the subtle, but deadly cf. (compare) in the footnote. This indicates, at least to the expert reader, both that an alternative view appears in the cited work and that it is wrong'.  Grafton has worked in many European languages and this allows him to humorously  include and compare the many differing ways that footnotes can convey bile - \\" The English do so with a characteristically sly adverbial construction `oddly overestimated'.  Germans use the direct `ganz abwegig' (totally off-track); the French, a colder, but less blatant `discutable'\\".      The book traces the evolution of the `scientific' recording and interpretation of texts to convey historical scholarship through the work of historians of  three centuries, and it is though this that Grafton exhibits great learning and humanity. The foibles, ambitions and disputes are clearly acknowledged as is their passion for their work. Grafton has clear sympathy for both.  He is more grudging in acknowledging the contribution of philosophy - specially the work of Descartes and Voltaire - in the development of the uneasy concoction of art and science which is modern history.  This is a magnificent description of an exchange between Liebnitz and Bayle in the 1690's, where the latter's desire to document every mistake in historical writings available at the time, is called into question. Liebnitz instead argued that it would be more accurate and economical to pursue a project which documented the verified truth of historical research.   Each project is, of course, infinite, though Liebnitz's is the more practicable.     While Grafton ranges widely though the historians of the 14th to the 19th Century  I feel that he reserves especially favour for Gibbon and von Ranke, Gibbon for his masterful confidence and literate authority - Grafton goes so far as to suggest that Gibbon reluctantly adopted the footnote, feeling that it broke the narrative flow.  He favours Ranke for his zeal in perfecting the methodology of source quotation and interpretation as well as instituting the seminar for exposition and training of upcoming historians. Grafton points out, tellingly but humanely, that Ranke was not above self-delusion in his judgment of his own methodology, by showing that Ranke's own footnotes were less exact than the historian claimed.      The narrative,which can be quite detailed and wide-ranging, flows along thanks to Grafton;s style.  Complex points are not simplified, but nor are the human details overlooked  e.g. his laconic opinion of the medieval   Letters of Aristeas  is rendered as ` this fascinating book has the defect of being a forgery, but also the compensating virtues of beauty and clarity'.	2005-07-16

(She eventually proved a connection to three of them.) In these hundred pages, she recounts the research she undertook in the United States and then the adventures encountered and results obtained on three visits to England. Although she seems to rely on such questionable sources as _Burke's Peerage,_ she also spent many hours at the Society of Genealogists library in London, searching through primary sources and old manuscript lineages. There were errors of interpretation (what looked like \\"Hadbury\\" on a chart turned out to be a poorly-written \\"Fladbury\\") and serendipitous discoveries while driving about in Warwickshire and Yorkshire and hunting up people with the key to the local church. She studied the history of memorial brasses (having found 14th and 15th century brasses of eight of her own ancestors), made friends of cab drivers (who, years later, were still sending her clippings of interest from the local newspaper), and generally enjoyed the chase immensely. Undertaking such a project myself, I would have delved much more deeply into the available records on microfilm and would have consulted with other researchers and librarians -- she seems not to have heard of the Inter-Library Loan system -- before flying off to Heathrow with a much more complete and precise itinerary. Also, as is the case with self-published volumes of history and genealogy, this account of Mrs. Schieffelin's labors would have been improved by the attentions of a good editor. Nevertheless, while the style is a bit gushy and the technique sometimes naive, it's a lot of fun to read.	2005-07-15

In Jeff Pearlman's book about the Mets 1986 season the emphasis is on the \\"nasty\\". This account of the Mets second championship season recounts the carousing that highlighted this hated team. That the Mets were, for a brief time, more hated than the Yankees seems like an abberation. <br /> <br />Pearlman follows the Jimmy Breslin rule of reporting. He talks to the guys on the scene getting paid the least. Never have I seen more a baseball book related by the equipment and clubhouse personnel. These provide insights that have not been related elsewhere. <br /> <br />This journalistic approach serves as both the books strength and it's undoing. Jeff Pearlman is searching for a baseball Rosebud. He wasn't there, but he is trying to cover these events as if he were. The unreliability of this technique is exposed by two things. First, the opening chapter describes the Mets Roman orgy airplane flight after defeating the Astros in the National League playoffs (disclaimer:I hate the term \\"league championship series or \\"LCS\\"-as far as I'm concerned, post season games leading up to the World Series are Playoffs.). Trying and purporting to give an accurate account when none of the individuals could ever be expected to remember many specifics gets the book off on a titillating, but false, note. <br /> <br />This would not be so bad if Pearlman could earn our trust by at least getting his facts straight, but every so often he throws in a factoid that makes a close Met follower like myself react with the \\"huh\\" word. Ed Lynch did not pitch the most games for the Mets between 1982-1985 (he did have the most \\"Games Started\\"). Mike Scott is \\"credited with having the National Leagues highest earned run average in 1982, when it was in fact none other than Tom Seaver. Granted, these are small details, but that is the point. If we can't trust Pearlman with what can be verified, has he earned our trust with what can't be verified? This is thesecond thing that undermines Pearlman's \\"You Are There \\" approach. <br /> <br />The book is worthwhile for the coverage of the lesser lights, and the competent recap of the Met's postseason. This book would be better served by someone with Pearlman's ambition who was there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-10

I assumed it would not add much to what I had learned from Deffeyes's earlier book on the same subject, &quot;Hubbert's Peak: The impending world oil shortage&quot;.  What a mistake that would have been!<br />&quot;Hubbert's Peak&quot; remains an extremely valuable book for those who want to understand *why* Hubbert's hypothesis may be correct, but &quot;Beyond Oil&quot; is much better at explaining the hypothesis and showing us that the data supports it overwhelmingly.  The great new value in &quot;Beyond Oil&quot; is to be found in Chapter 3, The Hubbert Method.<br />In &quot;Hubbert's Peak&quot;, Deffeyes presented only qualitative and graphical descriptions of Hubbert's theory in the main text.  He describes what the theory means and why it was important. Reader's may believe him because the rest of the book makes his credentials unmistakable: Professor Emeritus of Geology at Princeton, obvious encyclopedic knowledge of petroleum geology, 50 years in the oil business or consulting to it, friendship and collegial association with Hubbert himself.   But his editor did not let him put any equations in the main text.  When he does get to the equations in the notes at the back, their presentation is too concise, they require too much math knowledge for most readers, and lack the associated explanation that would make their relationship to the theory easy to understand, even for many readers who have the necessary math knowledge. It's all there, but you have to be committed and sophisticated to dig it out.<br />In this new presentation, Deffeyes has performed a brilliant act of creation in constructing a quantitative explanation of Hubbert's theory that can be completely understood by anyone who can read graphs and do elementary high school algebra.  (The success of Hubbert's Peak must have persuaded his editors tolet him put a few equations in the text of this book.)  Instead of understanding merely the results of Hubbert's theory, and accepting them on Deffeyes's authority, you can understand, completely, the sequence of thought that leads from data to theory and back to data to check the support for the theory.  The effect is compelling.   Hubbert did not seem to understand his own theory this clearly until a decade of so after his early publications in the 1950s, and he never explained it simply.  His early arguments depended on educated guesses about the total volume of oil that could eventually be recovered from the oil provinces in question.  To this day, his detractors criticize the theory incorrectly on the assumption that it depends on a separate and independent estimate of the size of the ultimately recoverable resource in order to predict the date of the peak of production.  Hubbert removed this dependence, but his papers are apparently so hard to read that those who are looking for a way to refute the theory miss the improvement.  The revised theory *generates* a robust estimate of the ultimately recoverable resource from historical production data.  As history approaches the predicted peak, as now, the prediction of the peak becomes utterly compelling.<br />Deffeyes's renders Hubbert's theory transparently clear.  It's essence is a guess, verified by appropriate analysis of historical production data, that the rate of oil production has depended and will depend mainly and linearly on the fraction of the ultimately recoverable resource that remains to be produced.  The maximum possible production rate at any level of cumulative production is proportional to the product of the remaining fraction and the cumulative production.  This dependence on the fraction of oil remaining is manifested by an ingeniously selected  plot of the historical production rate data and the historical cumulative production data.  <br />The theory's disregard of other factors on which production must depend, such as the price of oil, technological improvements in extraction, accidents of history, and geopolitical incentives and constraints, infuriates the detractors of the theory.  The answer is that the production rate does indeed depend on these other factors, but the data demonstrates compellingly that it depends on them much less than it depends on the fraction of the ultimate total that remains to be extracted.  The reasons for this dominance of the single factor is well understood by geologists. &quot;Hubbert's Peak&quot; explains this dominance much better than &quot;Beyond Oil&quot;, so you'll need both books to argue against committed detractors. But anyone who takes the trouble to first understand Hubbert's hypothesis and what the data says about it will be looking to these explanations mainly to find reasons for the obvious empirical truth of the hypothesis.<br />Economists (and those who have been stupefied by economists' assertions) do not accept the hypothesis that the maximum production rate depends mainly on the remaining fraction, even though historical data provides overwhelmingly powerful support for the hypothesis and geological reasoning explains this support.  I am convinced that the economists have the mistaken impression that Hubbert's theory is merely qualitative and descriptive and as such cannot defeat their own simplistic qualitative ideas about resource quality pyramids and supply and demand.  Everyone who gives evidence of actually understanding Hubbert's theory seems to accept it. Those who repudiate it seem always to give evidence of not understanding it, or even of not caring to understand it.<br />Much loud opinion misrepresents Hubbert's theory, or gives it a status roughly equivalent to that of, say, the opinions of Wall Street analysts. It seems likely that Deffeyes's saw that his &quot;Hubbert's Peak&quot; had not produced the popular understanding he had hoped for, that Hubbert is sound science.  Thank goodness he has taken this second shot in &quot;Beyond Oil&quot;.<br />David Delaney, Ottawa	2005-07-10

Hoover and all the G-men are portrayed as complete baffoons while the criminals are, to an extent, glorified.

This is a tedious and overall relatively boring work about what should be an exciting subject.

Rational arguments against the existence of god are solid and irrefutable.  Maintaining faith in this fiction (xanity) has no rational basis.  Smith asserts. \\"Atheists have long contended that the concept of god is unintelligible, this being a major reason why it cannot be accepted by any rational man. The theist who openly admits this cannot expect to be taken seriously. The idea of the unknowable is an insult to the intellect, and it renders theism wholly implausible.\\" (Smith p.45)  Smith shows how all definitions of god reduce to religious agnosticism.  The agnostic's & xantian's common belief in the unknowable nature of god as expressed in alleged qualities such as ineffable, inexpressible, transcendent and unfathomable support the foregoing conclusion.   This  allows us to learn that \\"If god is completely unknowable, the concept of \\"god\\" is totally devoid of content, and the word \\"god\\" becomes a meaningless sound.\\" (Ibid p.44)   Therefor since \\"Religious agnosticism suffers from the obvious flaw that one cannot possiblly know that something exists without some knowledge of what it is that exists.\\" (Ibid p.43)  Smith delivers to the reader the inescapable conundrum of Xanity.  Two choices present themselves to the believer.  Quit the defense of the supernatural, or broadcast belief in the existence of a supernatural being \\"while arguing that this being is knowable, at least to some extent, by the human mind.\\" (Ibid p.46)  To claim god is unknowable yet knowable is to forsake the keep of reason.     Chapter three explores various characteristics of god, so the reader learns that \\"...the attributes of the Christian God cannot withstand critical examination; the concept of God is permeated with ambiguities, contradictions and just plain nonsense.\\" (Ibid p.50)    Both positive and negative theology are failures in alleviating these logical inconsistencies.  Negative theology defines what god is not while positive theology asserts what god is. Both fail because of the  Laws of Logic, The Law of Identity: A is A or anything is itself; The Law of Excluded Middle: Anything is either A or not-A; The Law of Contradiction: Nothing can be both A and not-A. (Ibid p.143)      On page 47 Smith lists the attributes of god from the National Catholic Almanac: \\"...According to this source, God is \\"almighty, eternal, holy, immortal, immense, immutable, incomprehensible, ineffable, infinity, invisible, just, loving, merciful, most high, most wise, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, patient, perfect, provident, supreme, true.\\"   How is it possible for the Catholic writers to declare god is incomprehensible yet list twenty-two other traits?   Smith found a xantian explanation. Thomas in \\"Philosophy and Religious Belief\\" asserts that god is not only ineffable but also immanent.  God cannot be ineffable and immanent for to be incapable of being expressed or indescribable is to not exist while existing or remaining within and being restricted to the mind are contradictory.  No being as depicted in the National Catholic Almanac can exist any more than can a square  circle. Thomas fails to reconcile god's incomprehensiblity with other attributes.  Xanity and agnosticism share the same irrationality.  The  agnostic has advantage over the xantian. She knows better than to assign qualities to god, for to say anything about god is to limit god.  To assert god possesses characteristic A is to say that does not have attribute not-A. (paraphrased from John Hospers, \\"An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis\\")  \\"Existence entails a finite nature, and if God exists, then God must be a finite being.\\" (Smith p.49)   Smith concludes that no attempt to define god succeeds.  \\"After judging religious agnosticism - the belief in a unknowable god - to be indefensible, we examined Christianity's attempt to escape from the irrationalism of agnosticism while retaining the notion of a supernatural being.  The escape wasa total failure. The attributes of the Christian God are merely a disguise, an elaborate subterfuge designed to obscure the fact that the Christian God is also unknowable. God's characteristics, while supposedly giving us information about God's nature. Actually accomplish the reverse: they plunge us further into agnosticism.\\" (Smith p.87)     The only flaw was in chapter nine \\"The Cosmological Arguments\\" While Smith succeeds in refuting \\"The First Cause  Argument\\" for god by demonstrating decoupling of causality from the epistemological context of existence, for \\"To demand a cause for all of existence it to demand a contradiction: if the cause exists, it is part of existence; if it does not exist, it cannot be a cause ... Causality presupposes existence, existence does not [presuppose causality ... Existence - not God - is the First Cause.\\"   he implies the Steady State model of Cosmology.  We now know through observational data of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and the accelerated expansion of the Universe that the Steady State model fails.  Smith wrote Atheism The Case Against God in 1979, at least two years prior to Alan Guth's  Inflation theory.  Inflation is now established as a leading theory of cosmic origins.  The Universe began uncaused by a Quantum Vacuum Fluctuation that gave rise to the energy potential  of a Higgs inflationary field.  This resulted in a rapid(10^-32 second) expansion of space-time of the order of magnitude of 10^50.   There was no cause or causality associated with this primordial or indeed any other Quantum Vacuum Fluctuation.  All the energy of the entire Universe was compressed into a Planck sized region at the inception of the  Inflationary period much like a similar sized Black Hole.  This means the Universe began in a state of maximum entropy; thus, no information from any time prior to the Inflationary epoch could have survived.  Additionally, the rapid expansion created much room for order to form.  As the fundamental forces decoupled from one another via spontaneous symmetry breaking, the nature of energy, matter, and the dark energy/matter congealed into what we see or infer.  This well known and verified scenario solves/refutes all of the cosmological arguments for god. A new afterward addendum to the book would thus seem to be needed.	2005-07-02

Imaginatively tracing Shakespeare's life from birth to death, Greenblatt shows us in varying degrees of detail both the man and his social/creative context.  We're exposed to most of the all-too few definite details of Shakespeare's personal life, such as his role as actor and shareholder of the Globe Theater or his role as dying father leaving items to his daughters and, somewhat, to his wife.  We get a lot of detail on speculations with regard to Shakespeare's possible Catholicism, along with the social/political context of the battles in England between Catholicism and Protestantism.  We get some details, though perhaps not quite enough, on theater at the time--delving into the various companies, rival writers, the physical theaters.     Along with the known, we get heaping portions of the unknown.  The book is full, arguably a bit too full, of speculations into all aspects of Shakespeare's life and writingsimagined meetings, imagined viewings of hangings or royal progressions, imagined sources or influences-some deeply convincing, others seemingly quite flimsy.    Despite the onslaught of detail, both verified and speculative, the reader is never far from Shakespeare's work, as Greenblatt returns again and again to the plays and poems that are at the center of Shakespeare, offering up critical readings that like the more speculative biography vary perhaps in degree of persuasion but never in degree of thoughtfulness.    In the end, while the amount and degree of speculation is sometimes discomfiting, Will in the World is not only a helpful book for anyone wishing to further their understanding of Shakespeare and his times, but also an enjoyable one.  Recommended.	2005-06-28

It is a conspiracy theory, and like many of them, with some strong threads of truth. So many people have reviewed it here, there is little need to repeat the contents, I'd rather discuss the premises of accepting or rejecting such a book, what it offers, what has gone before and what people may find acceptable.

Being a first-century orator and philosopher around the time of Christ, he was compared to Jesus of Nazareth by Christians in the fourth centuryand by various popular writers in modern times.<br /><br />\\"Apollonius' dates are uncertain. His primary biographer, Philostratus the Elder (c.170-247 CE) places him c. 3 BCE to 97 CE Others agree that he was roughly a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth. Charles P. Eells states that his date of birth was three years before Jesus, whose date of birth is also uncertain. However, Philostratus, in his Life of Apollonius of Tyana, places him staying in the court of King Vardanes I of Parthia for a while, who ruled between c.40-47 CE. Apollonius began a five year silence at about the age of 20, and after the completion of this silence traveled to Mesopotamia and Iran. Philostratus also mentions emperors Nero, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, and Nerva at various points throughout Apollonius' life. Given this information, a time-line of roughly the years 15-98 CE can be established for his adult life.\\" Wikipedia<br /><br />According to witnesses Apollonius healed the sick and lame, raised the dead, made prophecies, but when he was brought before the court to be condemned he slipped through the crowd, disappeared and lived in exile until he was well over 90 years of age. [...]<br /> Another who was said to be a miracle worker was the Rabbi,  Hanina Ben Dosa, a priest, [...]<br />[...]<br /><br />Honi The Circle Drawer, a rain-maker both also contemporary with Jesus also healed the sick and lame, raised the dead, made prophecies. (\\"Honi HaM'agel (*'''' ''''' (*As you can see, my Greek characters would not publish on this format, it does not recognize the actual letter format)Khoni, or *'oni, HaMe'agel, Hebrew for Honi the Circle-drawer) (First century BCE) was a Jewish scholar prior to the age of the Tannaim, the scholars from whose teachings the Mishnah (the first part of the Talmud) was derived.\\") [...]<br />[...]<br /><br />\\"During the first century BCE, a variety of religious movements and splinter groups developed amongst the Jews in Judea. A number of individuals claimed to be miracle workers in the tradition of Elijah and Elisha, the ancient Jewish prophets. The Talmud provides some examples of such Jewish miracle workers, one of whom is Honi HaM'agel, who was famous for his ability to successfully pray for rain.\\" Wikipedia<br /><br />Added to the story is the idea put forward by many that St. Paul with in cooperation with Rome, turned the Hebrew majority into the villains by creating in Jesus a figure which would be against violence thus pacifying Israel against rebellion. We know that Saul, considered himself a Roman citizen and was a persecutor of early Christians. Then he is supposed to have experienced a dramatic conversion and changed his name to Paul.<br />However, what if Saul/Paul was a secret agent who infiltrated Christianity?<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />Robert Eisenman suggests as much in his book, James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls, ,<br />[...]<br /><br />So do other researchers. There is also the story of another man named Jesus, Jesus the Son of Ananias who disturbed the peace of Jerusalem by running about shouting of the fall of Jerusalem. He was arrested, whipped and released. He was later accidentally killed by a catapult shot over the walls, but he was correct in his prophecy. Did Christian writers give the already dead Jesus credit for the prophecy of the other fellow? Or were they both correct? Some coincidence?<br /><br />Fact is that we can only follow the evidence. Faith and science, are two differing sides of what are both really religions. Most of the stories cannot be proven, we cannot even prove who assassinated JFK, RFK and MLK and why.<br /><br />Such speculative books are alluring and cannot be proven correct or incorrect.<br />I was raised as a  Catholic, after seeing in my own time what a political contrivance, marred by error after error, discrediting of true prophets, organized religion is and probably always was, a thorn in the side of God, and more interested in power, profit and control than truth, so I am somewhat ambivalent about both this book and the New Testament's accuracy.<br /><br />Do I think, as a man and an anthropologist, theologian, who initiated the discipline of Theoretical Theology, that the Creator sent a prophet named Jesus? I certainly don't rule it out. Is there enough evidence to merit Atwill's theory? I certainly think so. My tendency the last decade or so, was to believe that Paul at the instigation of Rome, wrote and spoke and influenced his followers to make the Jews the bad guys and Rome the good guys, as evidenced by the rather ludicrous tale of Pilate, so brutal a man, that even Rome recalled and replaced him because of his brutality, would kindly wash his hands of Jesus' murder and blame it on the enemy of Rome, the Jews. But do I believe that 21st Century skull and dagger stories like Atwill's are true? Not usually, but they are certainly fun to read.<br /><br />Recall please the vast number of errors in the New Testament (see my other reviews for details) and recall that the gospels were written 37-88 years after Jesus death. Recall that none of the evangelists was an apostle and that the names Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were given by the church to the initially pseudononymous gospels to give them prestige. Try that today and you will find yourself in a lawsuit or in jail. None of the writers of the gospels knew Jesus and it is doubtful that the later writers after Matthew ever even knew anyone who knew Jesus. Since the church after Constantine went about destroying any of the dozens of gospels extant at the time, except for the four, the shock the church received at the finding of the Nag Hammadi in 1945 was an example of God's irony 1600 years after the fact. Those gospels the church thought they had destroyed tell quite a different story than the four. Why weren't they all included in the canon? Good question!<br /><br />None of the gospels we currently have in our possession were written by eye witnesses and the 5400 copies of gospels extant were systematically changed, reedited, redacted and overwritten by the church. That is a matter which is easily verified by anyone with the background to translate them and the oldest, from about the 2nd or 3rd centuries, are copies of copies, of copies of copies, therefore we cannot know what changes were made to the originals only what changes have been made since.<br /><br />There are a great many differences from the earliest gospel extant to the next and so on. The changes put into Jesus mouth, were condemnations of the latest \\"heresies\\" of each era by redactors of the gospels, not by the original authors, but the presentations make it seem that those \\"heresies\\" were there from day one and that Jesus-himself, had addressed them. They were not and he did not. That is something any credible New Testament scholar knows but something those who want the truth obscured, or are too lazy to research and find out the truth for themselves, which they probably do not want to know anyway.<br /><br />Both the Father and Jesus admonished men to search, search, always search for truth and take no man's word for it, find out for oneself. God does not reward the lazy as Jesus pointed out in the story of the virgins with oil lamps. He also said he preferred a person to be hot or cold rather than ambivalent or lazy. Why some people allow charlatans who claim to be experts give them second hand knowledge is beyond me. Those who ridicule others who do the research answers the question of just who are the real anti-Christ's-to me they are the ones who do not search and who want to keep erred half-truths as a sacred writ. I believe Jesus to have been the messiah, the rest is open to discovery by the intellectual and graced, the Chosen ones, and to be ridiculed, as Paul said, by the \\"called\\", or those of weak understanding, unenlightened.<br /><br />The evangelists, all strongly influenced by Paul's<br />work, even those writing generations after he died, followed his direction closely. It has always been my take that Paul was the agent of Rome to create a docile religion and sell it to all, a propaganda much favoring the Roman conquests. Nor was it surprising that a few hundred years afterwords, the church did what Jesus rejected, the church accepted the \\"temptation in the wilderness\\" embracing the murderous Constantine and becoming the State Religion, and that is exactly what is happening today in America. Organized religion is culpable and remiss in not explaining to the faithful the dramatic discoveries of New Testament scholars, leaving the church split into two camps, the minority who are up to date on the newest research by Christian and other scholars and the ignorant who think that these legitimate discoveries are offensive lies and were always a true representation of truth. Maybe the church should own-up, forgetting that a house divided cannot stand.<br /><br />The conversion of sinners was and remains a very, very profitable business and we have seen the hypocrisy of organized religion which is able to dupe the less intellectually gifted and easily be used by politicians for nefarious ends as we have seen these last few elections. That they have turned the \\"Prince of Peace\\" into a murderer of those who believe other than what certain profit and politically motivated corporate interests wish them to believe in an effort to mobilize hate mongers and lower the name of the Messiah to their level of murder and profit, is not surprising. Do I think Atwill has hit the nail on the head? I think he is close, some conspiracy is always afoot, and that is why those who profit the most ridicule the intellectually gifted, as \\"conspiracy freaks\\". They hate those who do the research, discovering the answers hidden from superficial readers which embrace propaganda.<br /><br />Someone, somewhere, said, maybe of Nixon, \\"Just because you are paranoid does not mean they aren't all out to get you.\\" Therefore, \\"Just because some people think that all conspiracy ideas are ludicrous, that statistically means that many are probably true.

The previous reviewer fails to realize that just because one has shemitic DNA it does not have to mean that they are an Israelite. One should not use the word \\"jew\\", because there is no letter \\"J\\" or J-sound in Ibrit/hebrew, nor any CORRECT transliteration that has a letter \\"J\\" for english.  Just the word YAHUWDIM, from the tribe of YAHUWDAH, not Judah.<br /><br />Anyway..<br /><br />One can clearly see by simply using their scriptures that Edomites are indeed Shemitic people from the line of Esaw/Esau. Ya'acob (so-called Jacob) was from the line of Shem, which would surely make his twin brother Esaw/Esau shemitic aswell.<br /><br />So, don't be fooled just because someone says the \\"jews\\" in the land of Yisrael have \\"shemitic blood\\" that it makes them the Yahuwdim or another tribe of Yisraelites. The Yishmaelites (Ishmaelites) are clearly Shemitic, but are NOT from the line of Ya'acob/Yisra'el..Notice I said Yishmaelites, not \\"arabs\\". Just bcuz one is an arab it doesn't make them a Yishmaelite.<br /><br />The children of Ya'acob are not the only people that descend from Shem. There are many \\"Shemitic\\" people, only SOME of them are Yisraelites.  And NO, those Edomite Imposters are NOT from the line of Ya'acob/Yisra'el!!<br /><br />And the so-called DNA test that they use on the \\"jews\\" is against ANOTHER \\"jew\\"...OF COURSE they will match!! What kind of test is that!!!?? They just claim \\"jew guy A\\" has the Kohanin genetics, and test the other \\"jews\\" againt him, LOL!!<br /><br />Let's do some DNA test against ancient skeletal remains that have been found, and verified as Yisraelite remains...THAT would send the \\"jews\\" packing.<br /><br />This book is a pretty good read. I suggest that you might wanna read it with 'The Thirteenth Tribe' and Revelation 2:9 in your scriptures ;)<br /><br />Shalom :)	2005-06-26

It wasn't until she had her own career, a husband, and two boys that she actually realized there were basic biological differences between male and female behaviour. Her son was playing dinosaur and \\"I looked down at him one day as he was snarling around my feet and doing his toddler best to gnaw off my right leg, and I thought, This is not a girl thing-- this goes deeper than culture.\\"<br /><br />So begins her book. Much of the evidence that is presented is done as studies of sex in other animals (the birds and the monkeys- yes, literally) and her lines of reasoning as to \\"how this happened\\" are based along lines of possible biological evolutional forces- things that she admits are really little more than educated guesses dressed up as theories.<br /><br />The chapter on the differences between male and female brains was interesting in that she spent about 90% of the time either denying the validity of the studies or minimizing the verified physical results. (Sure, that spot is bigger, but we don't know that it does anything.)<br /><br />Occasionally, you come across a gem of the absurd. This one is a good example:<br /><br />\\"One leading French scientist of the nineteenth century sought to prove the existence and potency of this magical male stuff [testosterone] by injecting himself with pureed dog testes. He insisted that the extract boosted his energy and sex drive and enabled him to pee in a higher arc, a major issue for men, obviously, in contrast to women.\\" (pg. 158, beginning of chapter six)<br /><br />She is quite open and forthright about her own left of center feminist viewpoint on the whole subject, and freely gives her opinion on what she WANTS to be true (and making it clear that it IS her opinion).<br /><br />One basic concept to follow underneath it all is that if evolution has made us \\"this way\\" (biologically), there is no reason to conclude that it has stopped now... and since we have the ability to change our culture, we may tap into evolutionary pressures to change the biology of our race in regards to the basic makeup of our sexes. At the end of the book, she admits she has no idea if this is really possible, but it's obvious that she feels it certainly ought to be. Given her basic premises, it is a logical conclusion. If you look at the past as having created this current biology from something else, why should the process stop now?<br /><br />But to sum it up, I have to agree with the comments about tediousness, in particular towards the end. The last third or so of the book was read simply so I could be satisfied that I had read it, not because it still had my riveted and interested attention. It would have benefited either from a better organization of the material into a coherent overall development (aka a plot, if this were fiction) or of simply dropping the last third of the book.tion has made us \\"this way\\" (biologically), there is no reason to conclude that it has stopped now... and since we have the ability to change our culture, we may tap into evolutionary pressures to change the biology of our race in regards to the basic makeup of our sexes.

I don't like her hawkishness, dread the possibility of reliving eight years of Clinton for the next four years if she runs for President and quite frankly don't think she can beat any reasonable Republican. <br />ADVERTISEMENT <br /> <br />But in preparing for a television debate with Ed Klein, author of the buzz-hungry hit job The Truth About Hillary, I found it impossible to ignore the falsity of Klein's work. <br /> <br />Packed into 305 pages of scandal-monger gossip are claims that Bill raped Hillary in Bermuda to conceive Chelsea; that Hillary knew about the Lewinsky affair two years before it became public; that she may be a closet lesbian; and that legendary New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan \\"despised\\" her. To back up these ludicrous allegations Klein sources, respectively, \\"an investment banker from New York,\\" an anonymous DNC staffer who lacked firsthand or secondhand knowledge about Lewinsky, a college friend from Wellesley (whose name Klein repeatedly misspells) and Moynihan's wife Liz. <br /> <br />The Moynihan example alone is a case study in journalistic fraud. Klein claims he spent \\"several hours interviewing Mrs. Moynihan\\" for the book. Yet Moynihan's daughter Maura reveals in the New York Observer that \\"my mother hasn't seen Mr. Klein in over 20 years.\\" Klein, Maura Moynihan writes, \\"puts quotes around statements that were never uttered.\\" Absent invented conversations, Klein's reliance on anonymous sources has raised more than a few eyebrows. USA Today and other mainstream newspapers have refused to print the numerous accounts that can't be independently verified. A Washington Post review notes that Klein \\"repeats rumors and then footnotes them to a prior author who references the rumors.\\" <br /> <br />Klein's publisher Sentinel sought out to capture the next wave of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a comparison Klein says he is \\"proud of.\\" But unlike the nasty vets who arguably sunk <br />John Kerry's campaign, no one seems to be taking Klein's bait, least of all conservatives. <br /> <br />\\"This is one of the most sordid volumes I've ever waded through,\\" writes New York Post columnist John Podhoretz, one of a growing chorus of right-wingers who've discredited Klein. \\"Thirty pages into it I wanted to take a shower. Sixty pages into it, I wanted to be decontaminated. And 200 pages into it, I wanted someone to drive stakes through my eyes so I wouldn't have to suffer through another word.\\" <br /> <br />Leading Clinton-hater Dick Morris says the book \\"does not belong in our public dialogue.\\" Bill O'Reilly has refused to interview Klein. Bloggers on Redstate.org believe the right should shun him. <br /> <br />\\"The book seems so over the top I don't think it's going to be taken terribly seriously,\\" says long-time political observer Charlie Cook. The literary community has used even stronger language. Klein's book \\"is unlikely to change a single mind, let alone vote,\\" writes Sara Nelson of Publishers Weekly. <br /> <br />Bitter commentary, debunked accusations and shoddy reviews notwithstanding, Klein is still sitting pretty. He did, after all, win an $8 million advance for a sexed-up pack of lies. <br /> <br />********** <br /> <br />Many thanks are in store for Liliana Segura, who's been the Daily Outrage's ace researcher since January. Liliana is an anti-death penalty activist (visit the Campaign to End the Death Penalty), budding journalist (see \\"Knowing What You're Talking About\\") and was blogging at Fancy Robot long before it was cool.	2005-06-24

Science has no moral authority*.<br /><br />Good conservatives know it, successfully electing candidates and passing laws based on \\"moral values\\" (even when those laws may run counter to the morality of most religion).<br /><br />Good liberals deny it, and try to prove their denial  by wading bravely into a bottomless, amoral morass of data, hypothesis, conjecture, and debate. Then they pass laws to impose the authority of science (even when the results run counter to the values of the scientists).<br /><br />The idea \\"that science is the proper and exclusive foundation for thinking about and answering every question,\\" is called \\"scientism.\\" Leaving Us to Wonder explains how and why scientism threatens our lives, and challenges its mostly unexamined assumptions.<br /><br />It's an interesting challenge partly because it comes out of the halls of academe; the challengers are a credentialled evolutionary biologist (PhD from University of Wisconsin, Harvard post-doc, international research, tenure at St. John's) and a recognized philosopher (degrees from Rutgers and Purdue, published dean at Arizona State University). But anyone should find it a worthwhile and useful way to look at politics and progress.<br /><br />So what is it about science? Isn't it \\"good\\"? Isn't knowledge the basis for success and progress? Hasn't it raised us up out of the \\"dark ages\\" of ignorance and superstition to a place where everyone can have a chance to live well?<br /><br />As the authors point out, the discussion of how to \\"live well\\" is the province of philosophy, which is the love of wisdom. Scientism, on the other hand, is the love of fact and theories, and puts a higher value on knowledge than it does on living.<br /><br />The common assumption underlying scientism is that science is \\"real,\\" and morality is not. But Wiener and Ramsey point out that science must remove itself from reality in order to \\"do it's work.\\" Take water, for example: science says water is not water, but \\"H20.\\" Take truth: science says truth is not what we see and feel, but what can be proven, repeatedly, according to scientific standards.<br /><br />Science is merely a method for acquiring knowledge, but knowledge is not wisdom, it is a collection of facts and ideas that can be shared and repeated. Wisdom, on the other hand, comes from experience, and includes all the events and information and relationships a person can gather, and it can't be duplicated and verified, it can only be acquired.<br /><br />The method of science is experiment and hypothesis; the method of philosophy is experience and wisdom. Science being a human activity, however, scientists seeking wisdom claim that ethics and morality, must submit to \\"science,\\" as if scientific standards are the highest possible human standards.<br /><br />The logical problem with this progression is obvious, but like the elephant in the living room, we seem to ignore it: the scientific method only works with things that can be manipulated, things like water, chemicals, and heat; things that can be measured and weighed and standardized. Can you measure and weigh truth? How many pounds of justice does it take to right a wrong?<br /><br />Wiener and Ramsey say, simply, that the tools and ideas of science don't apply to matters like truth and justice. Trying to force a fit would be worse than using a 12 mm wrench on a 1/2\\" bolt. The wrong wrench will only strip the bolt, which can be replaced. But if you assume that life is made of nuts and bolts, you risk losing those things you can't bolt down and can't replace - things like the four seasons, or the gentle warmth of the gulfstream that makes England a \\"green and pleasant land\\" - things like truth and justice.<br /><br />So we need to begin by separating scientific curiosity, which can be satisfied only by facts, from our human capacity for wonder, which can only be satisfied by \\"asking how we ought to make a way of life together.\\"<br /><br />Curiosity is easily satisfied. Afew facts and we have the basis for a scientific paper, maybe a research grant or a private contract, or maybe even a Nobel prize.<br /><br />Wonder is never satisfied. It may offer points of understanding along the way, but it can only be lived. At the end of life there are no final answers or solutions, only death. So Wiener and Ramsey suggest that \\"engaging in philosophy will be seen as a radically important endeavor....\\"<br /><br />Indeed, the truth of that suggestion might be measured by how much the book might piss off both liberals and conservatives. I suspect liberals will bristle at the idea that \\"Darwinian science\\" has \\"dangerously authoritarian leanings.\\" And conservatives may bristle at the idea that morality is based on human experience rather than divine authority.<br /><br />But I hope that both sides will accept the invitation to engage in a discourse \\"where what comes to matter to us are not only questions of truth but more importantly questions of living well.\\"<br /><br />* It seems to me that the ultimate arbiter of right and wrong action comes neither from religion nor science, but from a general agreement between members of a society. In America (and elsewhere) we seem to lack broad agreement on what is right and what is wrong (tho I think the media may make it look worse than it really is). As I see it, our choice is to encourage the split so individual fragment groups can establish their own versions of authority, or we can try to find common ground, agreement, and a better semblance of unity.br />Curiosity is easily satisfied.

The author, Francois Ponchaud offers a detailed account of the Khmer Rouge takeover and subsequent political experiment that included horrific violence and totalitarian levels of state control. Ponchaud's book is mostly comprised of Cambodian refugee accounts recorded in Thailand once they escaped from the Khemer Rouge's brutal grasp. The accounts are extremely detailed and tragic, and I'm sure they were extremely informative at the time. However, Ponchaud's scholarship is not beyond reproach. For instance, he frequently tosses around numbers of refugees and Khemer militants, and there's little that can be verified from the refugee accounts, many of which are recorded second-hand. I'm afraid the vast majority of the sources that Ponchaud cites are just references to Cambodian radio broadcasts that cannot today be confirmed. Additionally, the entire last section of the book is given over to the background history of Pol Pot and his legions, tracing the origins of socialist thought in them, and bogusly arguing that the Khemer Rouge's ideology was the logical conclusion of all socialist thought. Unfortunately, there is barely a single source cited in this entire section! It really cannot be relied on. I'm not saying that the contents of this book aren't correct or that they're not worth reading, I'm just saying there is very little that can be verified. Still I'm sure the book was quite an eye-opener  at the time, but you should really check out the more serious scholarship on this subject that was printed after the atrocities for they are far more professional and are backed up with a wealth of resources. I recommend to all readers interested in the topic to read the articles produced by Yale University's Cambodian Genocide Program, a thorough study of the history and results of the Khemer Rouge's disastrous and barbaric reign.s and barbaric reign.	2005-06-23

Looking at the comic book cover, the sensationalistic back jacket, and cover to cover of unverified accusations, this book was tailor-made for conspiracy buffs. For example, they want you to believe that 15 years ago microchips were being injected into the bloodstream to reach the brain for the purpose of mind control. Never mind that 15 years ago wafer fabs capable of manufacturing such chips don't, and still do not, exist - oh, that's right, the government is covering them up! <br /> <br />This book has examples of criminals who, when arrested, claimed that the government was injecting voices in their heads. What the author seems to have left out is that claiming to hear voices is the first step in a defendant's PRETENSE of an insanity defense! Yeah, this author leaves a lot out. <br /> <br />But never mind, the facts make no difference to conspiricy fanatics, do they? <br /> <br />Stay away from this book unless you like it piled high and really smelly. <br />	2005-06-18

Unlike the clear objectivity of that book, here once again a deluded Japanese ultra-nationalist tries to skew facts that have been verified by numerous international sources. This is done using clumsy English, for the \\"benefit\\" for those gullible enough to accept a viewpoint where Japanese soldiers did no wrong in their march from Shanghai, where the Rape of Manila also never occurred, and where Allied soldiers and civilians were \\"guests\\" of Japanese \\"hospitality\\" during WWII, instead of its very unfortunate victims. The title of this book should read: \\"What We Hope Really Happened in Nanking\\", because the book is subjective whitewash. To believe the findings of a Japanese journalist assigned to the Imperial Army in China during WWII is the same as asking readers to embrace the propoganda of Joseph Goebbels or Soviet revisionists. <br /> <br />For those who truly desire to learn about the Rape of Nanking, you are better served to obtain works from legitimate historical sources, most of which unfortunately must come from outside of Japan. While I do admire many aspects of the Japanese culture, ultra-nationalists such as this misguided author do severe discredit to the youth of Japan today. Most of them are not fooled by their elders and harbor much private shame over Japan's role in brutalizing its Asian neighbors during the first half of the 20th Century. Books like this only will result in confusing the reader, rather than dealing forthright with the disturbing reality of what happened in China during the winter of 1937-38.	2005-06-18

Feynman	Books	5	2	2	N	N	The great chess game of physics	Science is discoverying the rules to the great chess game of the physical world.  If the rules do not work in all situations, one must assume there are new rules and this means accepting the reality that there are new rules.  We can not assume to control science or think to limit the rules because confined understanding of the rules.  The rules can be very complex.  Some rules are very predictable, such as the rules outside the atom; however, rules about the interior of the atom are largely unknown.<br /><br />At best we can approximate what science is.  We must simply observe and try to understand the physical rules.  Feynman tells us, to learn from experience and experimentation.  A scientist must have a curious mind, a scientist is a curious discover.  Doubt is good.  Doubt makes the scientist question, these questions lead to experimentation, observation of pattern, and arrangement of models to explain the observations.  Feynman doubts that further scientist will be able to contribute because of their intuitive powers, as in the case of Faraday, whose theories of the atom proved true long before the mathematical models verified the perceptions.  Feynman says, that scientist will need to know the mathematics techniques and concepts of the past and then incrementally build on these ideas.  Feynman says students are getting smarter, in the early 70s, QED was thought to be too complicated for undergraduate students and currently the University teaches the class to undergraduates.<br /><br />The experiment proves the truth.  Science and mathematics is about pattern recognition and memory recall.  Feynman explains physics in the first person, explaining what it would be like in an atom, what a person would see, if they could see quarks and quark streams.  I particular enjoyed how Feynman explains how his father taught him physics.  His father explained inertia by demonstrating to young Feynman that the ball does not move against the back of the wagon but the wagon moves against the ball.  Feynman became very skilled at visualizing pattern.  In one weaving class, Feynman was recognized by the teacher for his skill at predicting a weaving pattern before it was wove and then creating the complex series of patterns.<br /><br />Feynman observed that woman can be taught advanced mathematics.  Once while sitting in a cafeteria, he overheard two girls taking about knitting.  Feynman thought they were talking about geometry and when he discovered they were talking about knitting realized teaching mathematics to different brains was possible but that the approach may need to be different. Feynman does not like to teach equations and assemble of equations for students to get passing grades.  Instead, Feynman likes to provoke students to think, disprove, and fight to discover what the equations mean.

Simon Singh arranges the historical development of the big bang theory in a superb way drawing in ancient elements such as the Greek philosphers and atronomers right up to the recent data obtained by the COBE satellite. The big bang theory is a very unique one in that it predicts the method by which it can be verified or dismissed. Should the theory be correct then there should remain a residual background radiation and if this weak background radiation can be detected it would surely add indisputable evidence that the universe did indeed originate with one very BIG BANG! The chapters are very easy to read and only include mathematical equations when appropriate. Suprisingly, there is very little citation and referencing of comments and therefore sourcing the original material is not possible.The story of the big bang theory can be used to highlight how science works and develops and indeed how paradigm shifts can occur in science.	2005-06-15

This is even more impressive when one considers the numerous absurdities that otherwise rational individuals have blindly accepted, because they are part of the official story. America's post-9/11 transformation is a testament to the power of nazi-style propagandizing and the perennial gullibility of the public. Dr. Goebels would indeed be proud to see his 1930's era techniques for mass manipulation, so boldly demonstrated on the 21st century public! Without offering the slightest bit of independently verified proof for their version of 9/11 events, the U.S. government and media have effectively sold a terrorist/skyjacking explanation, soley on the assurances of government leaders, experts, and media personalities! This is certainly not unprecedented, but is still a wonder to behold! <br /> <br />If you have not yet examined the facts of 9/11 for yourself, then you most likely are completely misinformed about what actually occurred that day. The official story and massive cover-up have assured that. On the other hand, if you grasp the vital importance of government transparency, and the need to verify the as yet unproven 9/11 official story, against the facts, you'll benefit greatly by reading 'The New Pearl Harbor' by David Griffin. Dr. Griffin's book is a good starting point for people who understand the historical dangers inherent in blindly accepting government war propaganda as fact. In the four years since 9/11, brilliiant independent researchers following the trail of evidence, have managed to build an irrefutable case for 9/11 as a covert U.S. government psyop. This explosive information though suppressed by media censorship and derided by official ridicule, nevertheless proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the official story of 9/11 (just like the official story that launched the savage war in Iraq), is based upon outright lies! The New Pearl Harbor makes extensive use of this ground breaking research, and serves as a great introduction to the mountain of evidence disproving the offical 9/11 story. <br /> <br />The American Republic of Washington and Jefferson was a great idea, but it's continued survival is possible only if  <br />the American people are vigilant and savvy enough, to properly deal with the by products of government and official corruption like 9/11. When citizens of a constitutional republic become incompetent and easily deceived, they are ripe for tyranny. The Bush II team is busy building that very tyranny, thanks to the 9/11 hoax and the 'Big-Brother' enabling 'Patriot Acts'! Did you know that the word 'Gestapo' can be translated as the 'Department of Homeland Security'? Did you also know that the former heads of both the Soviet, and East German, Secret Police, now quietly work for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security? A facist state in some ways resembling the Third Reich, but with the potential to be far more oppressive and dangerous, is now rising right before our very eyes, upon the soil of the old American Republic, because too many of \\"We the People\\" remain unable, or unwilling, to deal with the fact that 9/11 was an inside job! <br /> <br />	2005-06-10

This is such a book. I am indebted to P.M.H. Atwater for citing it in her _We Live Forever_.<br /><br />_The first of the five parts of this volume deals with the true nature and structure of both the human body and the worlds in which it functions. The human being is a multi-dimensional entity composed of physical, bioplasmic (etherial), astral, mind (subconscious, conscious, superconscious), and soul bodies or levels. Above all, it is hammered home that the brain is not the mind.<br /><br />_The second section deals with the evidence of survival after physical death. Extremely good, succinct, descriptions are given of eleven types of evidence: 1) historical and religious writings, 2) death-bed, near-death, and out-of-body experiences, 3) apparitions, hauntings, and ghosts, 4) obsession and spirits, 5) spirit doctors, 6) spirit photographs, 7) materialism, 8) reincarnation, 9) space-time relationships, 10) conservation of matter and energy, and 11) communications through mediums and telepathic channels.<br /><br />_Part three gives detailed descriptions of the interpenetrating planes of existence: the physical plane; the low, middle, and high astral planes; the mental-causal planes, the celestial planes, the cosmic God Head, the end of manifest creation, the void of pure consciousness, Nirvana, and beyond.<br /><br />_ The fourth part gives 50 specific questions and answers to the system put forth. This includes the proven path for individual soul development (which agrees with the perennial philosophy and the core teachings of all the great religious founders.)<br /><br />_Now, part five gives some truly mind-boggling examples of communication with the dead via electronic instrumentation. I had read Sherman's work years ago, but this goes far, far beyond. The heart of the historic O'Neil-Mueller communication is included.<br /><br />_Not only did this book strike me as having the \\"ring of truth\\", but it verified so many of my own experiences and conclusions over the years.

US	41639692	R1EPHR1WRHRC39	1933113278	305416011	The War Between the Hearts	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Midwest Book Review, June 2005 Issue	It seems odd that well over one hundred years had to pass before verified information surfaced about women soldiers serving in the Civil War. Folklore and tall tales have often featured women soldiers disguised as men and working as spies, smugglers, and scouts, but interesting and documented books about the women in the military haven't come out until the last few years. Recent non-fiction books have found that at minimum, 700 women served - disguised as men - in the ranks of the Union and Confederate armies. Some say that number should be closer to a thousand. Scores of women died at Gettysburg, undiscovered until burial. Many nameless women probably served that the history books will never detail.    So it seems timely that author Nann Dunne has created the fictional Sarah-Bren Coulter, a handsome southern woman who cannot resist the pull of the Civil War. Her twin brother stays behind to run the family foundry, and Sarah - disguised as Bren Cordell - becomes a courier-scout for the Confederate Army while spying for the Union. She finds the battles of war unlike anything she ever expected. She sees more blood and death than any person ever should. And then she herself is wounded. Instead of dying, fortune smiles upon her, sending her into the hands of Faith Pruitt, a woman with a young son who lives close to some of the fighting. But safety with Faith is not to last long. Sarah is trapped on the border of Union and Confederate forces-and which should she hold herself out as?    From that point on, the plot turns more desperate as the danger Sarah has tried to escape catches up with her. Her strength, her mental and physical stability, and her ethics will be sorely tested as she deals with the damage that befalls her. Revenge, retribution, murder-and lost love-will weigh heavily on her mind. Will Sarah Coulter be strong enough to deal with her future?    The author has done an excellent job researching the setting and time, while never inundating the reader with ahistory lesson. The drama of the story comes alive because of this. Once the novel is set up, the action is fast-paced with scenes ranging from hate-infused to anguished to terror-stricken, all of which are nicely balanced with scenes of strong friendship, camaraderie, and love. The characters in the book are full-bodied and complex and include sister-in-law Lindsay, whose ongoing support, even in face of her husband's condemnation of Sarah, is balm to Sarah's soul. Her friend Phillip is steadfast in his caring for Sarah in spite of multiple marriage rejections. There is humor and mutual respect between Sarah and her friend Leah, a \\"woman of ill repute\\" whose role in the story is central. Of course Faith, and her son Benjamin, are also critical to this \\"war between the hearts.\\"    Nann Dunne has created an unforgettable heroine, a woman before her time, standing at the crux of a new age. This fast-paced and gripping story will keep you up late at night. Highly recommended. Don't miss it! ~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review and author of the \\"Gun\\" Series and other books	2005-06-01

This point is that Biblical teaching really mandates the ideals of the democratic party. For example, Clinton said that we could all agree that we should make abortions safe, rare and legal. The newly elected Senator from Illinois, Obama, was colored as purple, a mix of red and blue in Time magazine. This was done to find a neutral ground. He and others have been telling us repeatedly that the Bible calls upon us to correct social ills. Jesse Jackson, of the Rainbow Coalition, also has offered an alternative to the mindset of conservative Christians. Often, people simply assume their view to be the one that the Bible teaches without reading it in context. This especially holds in the area of political persuasion. In addition, according to exit polling, spiritual/moral issues played a large part in the way that many citizens voted. Therefore, Mr. Wallis is doing us a big favor by bringing up the question. <br />Does the Bible teach the views of the Republican right or the Democratic left? The democratic view is that the Bible teaches that the government is to correct all societal ills in order to achieve equality. The republican view is that the Bible calls upon private citizens to act charitably and voluntarily to help out those in need. Now, the question is where does the Bible specifically state that the government is the agency to help others? Certainly, numbers of passages address individual Christians to act charitably towards those in need. Those are easy to find. However, an injunction to redistribute income from those who worked hard for it to those who did not earn it is difficult to find in the Bible. Paul mentions giving should be done voluntarily. In other words, it should not be the government forcing one to give what one worked for to others who did not earn it. The private citizen ought, then, in the mind of Paul, to choose what he or she does with his or her hard-earned money. The commands to give to others appear to always be speaking to individual private citizens who  are Christians and not addressing heads of state, as such, in their actions leading a government.  <br />Next, capital punishment is not in view in the Sermon on the Mount. There, Jesus is talking about a person not seeking private, personal retribution when they were personally wronged. However, Jesus says nothing about the government not punishing a criminal. Hence, this passage is taken completely out of context when it is used to support liberalism. Further, Exodus 20 gives laws for a nation, Israel. Paul, in Romans 13, brings up the point that the government does not bear the power of the sword for nothing. This is clearly refering to beheading people. He, therefore, is clearly endorsing capital punishment. Moreover, Genesis 9:6 and 7 states that whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. Therefore, it also endorses capital punishment. Hence, capital punishment is taught repeatedly in numerous parts of the Bible. Thus, it is a principle which God endorses for any age.  <br />Additionally, the Bible nowhere teaches that all wars are wrong. If it did, then fighting in World War II was wrong. Only the most ignorant of people will feel that WWII was an unjust war. If one feels that all war is wrong it is probably because one  feels that all killing is wrong. If this were the case, one would have to state that a police officer shooting a rapist who is about to murder a little girl is morally wrong. This is the logical conclusion of that view. Since our friends who are opposed to capital punishment will not adopt that view, they can be shown that they are logically inconsistent with their own views and forced to choose to acknowledge their viewpoint is incorrect. Special pleading is certainly not allowed. Once this point has been made, one now must logically acknowledge that the concept of a just war is possibly correct and cannot be ruled out. The Bible certainly gives examples where God told Israel to make war against their enemies, the Amalekites who committed infanticide. Consequently, the Bible allows for a war to be possibly just. Therefore, one is forced to prove that any one specific war is unjust and not just to assert that a party is wrong for engaging in a war. Whether a war is just or not can be debated. It certainly cannot be proven that the prosecution of the war due to the violation of the cease fire terms by Iraq was unjust. On the other hand, Scripture clearly sees babies as alive, even in the womb (example John the Baptist, Psalm 139). Therefore, abortion, in the eyes of Scripture, is taking a life. Moreover, it is the taking of an innocent life, in contradiction to capital punishment which is the taking of a guilty, murderous life (hence, capital punishment and an opposition to abortion are in no way inconsistent unless innocent babies are to be considered the same as murderers). Taking innocent life is murder. Murder is clearly condemned in the Bible. Thus, the Bible clearly teaches that abortion is wrong, since in context it is viewed as murder in the Bible. Therefore, the perspective of the Bible on this issue is crystal clear unlike the position of the Bible on whether any one specific war is unjust. Hence, when tallying points for parties, one can give a point clearly to the Republicans regarding abortion. On the other hand, one cannot say for certain whether or not any one war is wrong, according to the Bible since the Bible does recognize that some wars are legitimate. Therefore, one could not for sure assign any points to a party simply because they opposed a war. Further, clearly one can give a point to the Republicans because of their support for the belief that charitable giving should be voluntary and private. The democratic contention that the government must provide charitable giving through raising taxes on those who work hard to earn money (forcing them to give to others who did not work for the above money) cannot be verified from the Bible. Hence, the democrats do not gain any points on the basis of this view. Moreover, the Bible clearly teaches capital punishment. Hence, the Republicans clearly gain a point for supporting capital punishment. The democrats contention that capital punishment is explicitly refuted by the Bible; thus, they do not get a point for their views.  <br />In other words, evangelical Christians read the Bible in context. When one reads it in context and analyzes policy positions, it is undeniable that the Bible teaches the positions of the Republicans. One may not agree with the Biblical positions, but all honest and literate people will acknowledge that the Biblical positions are clearly better stated in the Republican platform in contrast to the democratic platform. Conservative Christians recognize what somebody is simply trying to impose their views onto the Bible and when the Bible in context actually teaches them. Therefore, they spot the errors in this type of propaganda rather easily. They can clearly see that the Bible teaches the Republican views. Thus, there is a great solidarity among evangelical, conservative Christians in their voting. Only liberals who do not believe the Bible and take it out of context will agree with the democratic platform. However, Wallis is badly mistaken if he thinks that he will convince any true conservative Christians to embrace the democratic party.	2005-05-31

Books	1	48	54	N	N	Illegal, immoral, and fattening	This may be one of the most frightening investment books ever written. An early work of \\"nothing down\\" guru Robert G. Allen, the book offers \\"cookie cutters\\" for making a killing in real estate, as well as a handful of other tips for gaining wealth. The advice can be divided into three categories: <br /> <br />1.  Obvious: \\"buy low, sell high.\\" <br /> <br />2.  Stupid: \\"buy high, sell low.\\" (Hint: run the numbers on some of Allen's deals. Often his oh-so-clever leveraging doesn't beat inflation for returns... or the results depend on truly improbable amounts of luck, with sellers willing to take pennies on the dollar because they're just bored with ownership.) <br /> <br />3.  Illegal: \\"inspect your properties at least once a month.\\" In California, the landlord doesn't have the right to do a monthly walk-through. Don't even ask about some of his moves with over-mortgaging on properties you don't own in the first place. Just back away slowly. <br /> <br />Allen's tax liens from his investment adventures around the time he wrote this book can be verified with an online search of Utah County's property records. Personally, I don't call a $346,000 tax lien a sign of \\"success\\" and prefer not to take investment advice from someone whose credit is far worse than mine. But that's just me.	2005-05-30

I subsequently found out that it is widely used in highschools, colleges and universitites.  I have to admit that ordering the Cliff Notes along with the book was a wise decision and you can note from my many other reviews on Amazon that I am a sophisticated reader.  THINGS FALL APART is not always easy to follow.  Reading the Cliff Notes along with the book helped me with some of the underlying meanings and also verified that I had to correct understanding of some of the situations.<br /><br />I believe that if there is one major theme in the book, its the clash of cultures. We as westerners always identify with the westerners who make first contact with people of other cultures.  As a result it hard to identify with other cultures. THINGS FALL APART gives you that chance to understand other religions and how other people life.  But it also gives you the opportunity to think about basic concepts of right and wrong.  While the book takes place in Africa, the situations can be compared to other religions and other clashes of culture.<br /><br />At first glance we think it absurd for the tribe to blindly follow the word of the oracles.  But then think of situations in other religions and other times when people blindly followed the directions of a dictator or religious leaders.  The bottom line is that there is much room for discussion in this book.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that a few students wrote reviews of this book panning it.  Apparently they did only did a superficial reading of the book.  Or possibly did not get a good background lecture from their teachers.<br /><br />This would be a great book for discussion in a book club.  It is for the serious reader.  It makes the reader reflect on his or her own life and culture and wonder what decisions you would make if faced with the same situation.  Are there basic concepts of right and wrong that go beyond the demands of culture? Did Okonkwo's failure come about as a result of his going against those basic conflicts?  Read the book and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Although this is a book about early contact between Europeans and primitive African peoples it is not about first contact.  You will note that Okonkwo, has a gun which he obviously got from a European.  That gun contributes significantly to his down fall.  A good topic for discussion is the influence of guns in the story.'s failure come about as a result of his going against those basic conflicts?

US	18322246	R171YF7RGDRUFC	091756152X	760519181	Evolution: A Theory In Crisis	Books	4	18	56	N	N	computer programming analogy is compelling	Dr. Michael Denton is clearly not a creationist. That is obvious from his first chapter, \\"Genesis Rejected\\". However, he is clearly questioning the truthfulness of macroevolution in any form. This books shows that even secular scientists can see validity in many of the arguments that creationists are making. I find the computer programming analogy very compelling. Evolutionists often argue that although the odds of it seem low, that time is the hero of the plot. They feel that although most mutations (or really all since sickle cell anemia is fatal 30% of the time-thus, not beneficial)are negative, making positive mutations building on other positive mutations... very unlikely, that there is all that time, during which more mutations will take place. However, these mutations are introduced randomly and are harmful to the organism. The longer that a monkey hits the keyboard while writing source code, the more sytax errors the monkey will accrue. Therefore, time only worsens the situation. Even the simplest of programs (written in C++ for example) are coded by intelligent human beings. They do not appear randomly. Not even imperfect but functioning programs are randomly produced out of thin air. Human beings are infinitely more complex than these programs. Thus, it appears likely that we were created by intelligent design.  <br />Certain reviewers did not appear able to answer the arguments presented in the book. Hence, they resorted to ad hominem arguments (e.g. john tglaferri), by calling Christians half wits and mocking their belief in Christ's return. One wonders how well such a person would defend his or her own beliefs. Denton's book reveals the bankruptcy of the claims of such people. It only a few seconds any Christian can make it crystal clear what a fool this type of person is by pinning them down on their own beliefs and what evidence supports their views. Almost all people on the planet Earth recognize that rape is always wrong, everywhere in all times, places and cultures. However, moral absolutes logically require the existence of a perfect God. Logically, to deny the existence of God is to deny that there are any moral absolutes at all. To say that rape is wrong is to compare it to a perfect absolute standard. That perfect absolute standard is what Christians mean by God. It is specifically God's character and clearly must exist in order to know that rape is wrong (ie imperfect) all the time, everywhere. Further, all people act as if there are moral absolutes whenever they claim that they were wronged or they claim that somebody else was wronged. When they act like this, they are necessarily stating their certitude of the existence of God. Moreover, our reviewer clearly believes in the perfection of the Bible (unless he is unsure of whether rape is always wrong) or he would not be absolutely certain that rape is wrong. For if he did not believe in the perfection of the Bible, he would have an insufficient logical basis to be positive that rape is wrong. For he would have no perfect source of knowledge from whence he drew the conclusion that rape is wrong. Since his source of information could possibly be flawed, then he would have to conclude that rape might possibly be wrong, but he is unsure. No serious adult would say that he or she thinks that rape is possibly wrong, but is not certain. Further, our reviewer obviously came up with his own world view off the top of his head. With all due respect, a great many people find it less than compelling. He will have to offer something more convincing than simply his own bare naked assertion. He has nothing to offer in place of Christianity. He has no answers to : does God exist?, what is the meaning and purpose of life? What was our origin and what is our destiny? Is there a Heaven? Is there a Hell? Who goes where? Who was Jesus? Will we be resurrected? What is sin? Where did evil come from? Christianity's credentials are unimpeachable. First century Jews did not writehistorical fiction. Hence, the gospels must be taken as writing intended to accurately represent what actually occurred. These documents were accepted as accurate records of history by those who were eyewitnesses themselves to the events described within them. Their specificity shows that they were written by or transcribed by eyewitnesses. The four gospels all agree that Christ was beaten, whipped, crucified on a cross, buried in a tomb, rose from the dead three days later and appeared to numerous witnesses over a forty day period. How does one account for their agreement? Either this is what actually happened or they must have collaborated together and intentionally wrote lies which they knew were false. If those events did not actually occur, who would have written that these events did occur (and we have four documents that say that this is exactly what did occur)? Moreover, how does one account for their acceptance as accurate by those people who were eyewitnesses to the events described in them if they were way off base? If they had been inaccurate, the eyewitnesses would have rejected them and said do not accept these writings, we were there and this did not happen. Further, what one reads in the gospels fits very nicely with what one finds in Josephus (a nonChristian) describing those times. Anachronisms and inaccuracies would have been revealed. In addition, one discovers that some 25000 archaeological finds have verified both in general picture and in specific detail the historical accuracy of the gospels in the most minute respects. Their accuracy as demonstrated by archaeology  in details demands that we accept the major events that they describe as historically accurate since first century Jews did not write historical fiction. In ancient history one does not find unhistorical myths developing in less than five hundred years after the historical people. In other words, there is no case in ancient history where a legend which was inaccurate developed inless than five hundred years (from the person who was the protagonist in the legend). Further, if the resurrection were not true, why did Paul challenge his readers to go ask the 500 witnesses who saw Christ alive after his death? He said that you do not have to simply take my word for the resurrection of Christ from the dead, you can go ask the 500 people who were eyewitnesses of his resurrection since almost all of them are still alive. Paul's writings state that Christ was crucified, buried, rose again and appeared to numerous people. His writings begin around a.d. 45 (1Corinthians). If those events were not true, why did he write them (ie what was his motive)? Further, those events were relatively recent to the death and resurrection of Christ (ie about a decade later) with great numbers of eyewitnesses around who could either confirm the accuracy of what Paul wrote or reject it, stating that it was inaccurate. Why were his laters accepted without question? The apostles were still around until at least A.D. 70 (most of them). If the gospels and Paul's writings were not accurate, the apostles themselves would have stated the fact. Why did Paul change from somebody who persecuted Christians to somebody who promoted Christianity? These facts and numerous others necessitate the conclusion that Christ really physically rose from the dead after being killed on a cross. For any person who really wants to know whether Christianity is true, these facts are more than convincing. As a scientist (member American Mathematical Society),  I find the evidence of Christianity overwhelmingly compelling. This is why the saying that to find an atheist one must go to the philosophy department because we in the science department are not much help comes from.  <br />Denton presents only a small part of the challenge that the vocal and vitriolic opponents of Christianity must confront. Yet, he does it well.	2005-05-28

So easy to read and once you pick it up, you just can't put it down.

While I was expecting more of a collection of stories of starting up this church (I've been around since before the official launch, so it's been entertaining to match the stories with their owners), that's not really what this is.  It's more of a treatise on how to create an effective, welcoming culture to reach out to  unchurched people in a relativistic, postmodern society.<br /><br />That's not language I use in my everyday life, but it's the language used throughout this book.  It's not an easy read, but it's virtually guaranteed to provoke thought in anyone trying to create such a culture.  If that's your goal, I highly recommend this book for you.  If you're looking for a book of dozens of stories of God at work in the world, it's also good for that.  For a lighter read, skip the scholarly parts between the stories.  John is an excellent storyteller, and I know from personal experience that every story was verified.  Good stuff.  Enjoy!	2005-05-23

Kennedy, 1963: The Report of the Warren Commission, September 1964 (Uncovered Ecitions)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Commission Verdict -- "No Credible Evidence Of Conspiracy"	The seven-member \\"Warren Commission\\" panel (plus its staff), which was created by President Lyndon Johnson one week after the murder of President John F. Kennedy in late 1963, had an immense and difficult task thrown on its doorstep -- To review, probe, and investigate all aspects of JFK's assassination (plus two other killings as well -- those being the murders of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit and the accused Presidential assassin himself, Lee Harvey Oswald, the latter being gunned down by Jack Ruby just two days after JFK's death).<br /><br />Many (or even most) people who express an opinion re. the matter seem to be of the belief that the Warren Commission panel did not arrive at anything resembling the 'truth' when it concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby \\"acted alone\\" when each of these men committed their respective murders in November of 1963. The conspiracy theorists feel that LBJ formed the \\"WC\\" for one express purpose and one only -- to back up and validate (by any means necessary) the pre-determined conclusion that Oswald was the lone killer of President Kennedy.<br /><br />I completely disagree with such skepticism. The \\"CTer\\" accusations of \\"WC\\" wrong-doing and 'cover-up' in this case are unfounded, IMO.<br /><br />Let's just step back from the 'Conspiracy-filled abyss' for a moment and check out just exactly what the Warren Commission members had staring them in their collective faces when it came to ascertaining the true facts in the JFK assassination -- regarding the much-scoffed-at \\"Single-Bullet Theory\\" (\\"SBT\\") specifically. ........<br /><br />1.) A bullet wound of entrance in JFK's upper back.<br />2.) A bullet wound of (probable) exit in JFK's throat.<br />3.) A bullet wound of entrance in Governor Connally's back.<br />4.) ZERO bullets found in either victim.<br />5.) NO interior limousine damage where damage WOULD have been had a bullet exited JFK's throat and NOT hit Connally.<br />6.) One single bullet found at Parkland Hospital (near the Connally stretcher), which was positively proven to have been fired from Oswald's rifle; with this same bullet ('CE399') being scientifically linked to the fragments found in Connally's wrist (to a great degree of certainty that bullet was inside Governor Connally on 11/22/63).<br />7.) A filmed record of the shooting, via the \\"Zapruder Film\\", that (nearly) confirmed a SBT scenario. (Plus, via better-quality versions of the Z-Film in later years, additional validation of the SBT popped up -- the Connally involuntary reactions at Z224-Z228 approx.)<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />Given the above laundry list of FACTS, I'm just curious to know what other possible conclusion the Warren Commission was supposed to come to regarding the wounding of JFK & JBC on 11-22-63?<br /><br />A \\"Single Bullet\\" is the ONLY possible way this shooting (i.e. the non-head wounds) can be reconciled given the above list of known facts in the case. Unless you wish to believe the much more far-fetched idea of a vast 'conspiracy' that conveniently 'took care' of the many 'loose ends' mentioned above. A logical alternative, I ask? IMO -- no.<br /><br />The Dallas Police Department and the Warren Commission had ONE lone suspect (Oswald); with no other leads guiding them toward ANY other possible suspect(s).<br /><br />And this ONE suspect (Oswald) was, as of 12:32 PM on November 22, inside the building from where gunshots are KNOWN to have been fired (the Texas School Book Depository), the same building where Oswald's own rifle and his own (multiple) fingerprints on various objects were found to be located just shortly after the assassination.<br /><br />And this ONE suspect (Oswald) was positively identified as the man seen firing a rifle at the motorcade from that very same building.<br /><br />And the WC was also faced with the fact that no rifle bullets or bullet fragments or cartridge cases other than those linked to Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano bolt-action rifle were found anywherein the bodies of the victims, the car, the hospital, or in the TSBD, or in Dealey Plaza.<br /><br />Oswald was THE only suspect in the case; this is certainly true. .... Why? -- Because there were no other suspects to hunt down! None. How much shadow-chasing was supposed to have been done by the DPD and/or the WC before they realized they were, in fact, chasing phantom gunmen who never existed?<br /><br />After evaluating Oswald's known movements before and after 12:30 PM on November 22nd, the idea that Oswald was simply an unwitting 'Patsy' who was being framed for the assassination becomes a far less-palatable theory, IMO. ... Oswald's own gun is found on the 6th Floor of the TSBD and his fingerprints are all over the place WHERE THE ASSASSIN IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN.<br /><br />Plus -- There's the Tippit murder (which is a killing that had multiple witnesses watching Oswald fatally shoot the police officer); plus the \\"paper bag\\" brought into the building which very closely resembled the empty bag found in the 'Sniper's Nest' which has LHO's prints on it; plus Oswald's 'curtain rod' lie; plus Oswald's unusual trip to Irving on November 21 (to obviously pick something up at Ruth Paine's home that he would be needing the following day at work; wonder what that 'something' might have been?); plus Oswald's constant lies after his arrest.<br /><br />Does all of this add up to an unwitting and unknowing Patsy?<br /><br />Also -- WHY in the world conspiracy theorists want to believe that the SBT wounds don't \\"line up\\" correctly is yet another CT-ism I have never understood. (I guess if the CTers say it often enough to each other, it becomes the 'CT Gospel' evidently.)<br /><br />If you gaze upon the readily-available JFK autopsy photos, you can see for yourself that the AUTHENTICATED pictures of JFK after death show the back and neck wounds to be 'aligned' so that a single missile could most certainly have passed through his body at those given points of entry and exit from above and behind him (with the bullet moving in a slightly downward trajectory of about 17 degrees).<br /><br />And as for JFK's head wound -- the verified autopsy photos re. that wound also confirm (as do multiple doctors who testified in front of the WC panel) that the head shot came from BEHIND the President, exiting out the front-right side of his head.<br /><br />There is NO evidence anywhere in the official record of ANY bullets striking either victim in this case (JFK or JBC) OTHER than the two bullets that were proven to have been fired from the rifle found on the 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building -- which was a rifle that belonged to none other than a Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald.<br /><br />If good ol' \\"Occam's Razor\\" ever applied to any single aspect of the JFK murder case, the SBT is it, IMO. For HOW could the CT 'alternative' possibly be LESS complicated and acceptable than the SBT.<br /><br />Any \\"Conspiracy-related Alternative\\" to the SBT must include all of the following........<br /><br />>> THREE disappearing bullets! (Three of 'em! Maybe even FOUR bullets, depending upon which crazy conspiracy theory is being considered; because some 'theorists' claim Connally was hit twice, instead of just once, which would then mean yet another (4th) disappearing missile in the case);<br />>> Wound locations that nicely align themselves into a \\"Single-Bullet Theory Ruse/Hoax/Dodge\\";<br />>> Two rifle bullets that just happen to not go all the way through John Kennedy's body for some reason -- was this just by 'accident'? Or via 'dum-dum' bullets? Or via 'dart' shot(s)?

And I, for one, cannot find any \\"credible\\" reason to dispute that conclusion either.photos re. that wound also confirm (as do multiple doctors who testified in front of the WC panel) that the head shot came from BEHIND the President, exiting out the front-right side of his head.    There is NO evidence anywhere in the official record of ANY bullets striking either victim in this case (JFK or JBC) OTHER than the two bullets that were proven to have been fired from the rifle found on the 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building -- which was a rifle that belonged to none other than a Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald.

Stewart traces the career arc of CEO Michael Eisner beginning with his rise through the ranks of the entertainment industry and into the present day, as a chief executive of more than 20 years at one of our nation's most venerable companies. <br /> <br />In the interim there is enough palace intrigue to make Shakespeare and Puzo jealous.  Sadly, Eisner comes off little different than managers or supervisors many of us have known, unwilling to take blame, but always glad to hoard credit (even when the credit is due others), paranoid, insecure, constantly undermining and constantly manipluting those below him.  Of course, here the difference is that the manager is a CEO worth nearly $1 billion and the company is Disney. <br /> <br />The litany of poor interpersonal relations Eisner had with senior executives, from Jeff Katzenberg to Mike Ovitz to Lloyd Braun and others reads like a who's who of the entertainment industry.  Indeed, one of the great ironies of this book comes well toward the end, when the list of former Disney executives is itemized by Stewart along with their current roles, many as CEOs or senior executives with companies like Ebay, Yahoo, Dreamworks, Hilton, etc.  Had Eisner even kept a handful of the many executives he chased off, the search for his successor would have been far easier.  Shareholders who wish to consider Eisner's views of his now chosen successor, Robert Iger, may not leave with a very comfortable feeling.  This distrust is then coupled, for the last third of the book, into a damning portrayal of the Disney Board of Directors, which comes off as feckless and indecisive, unwilling to cross Eisner, and for the few who do, a quick stripping of power occurs.  Comcast's abortive 2004 attempt to acquire Disney is not given the full reporting it is probably due(though in light of the interest in getting the book out, it is perhaps understandable); however, the reader is given a good sense of the rapid decline of Eisner's power as disgruntled Disney family member Roy Disney and his lawyer Stan Gold, ratchet up the heat and secure a near 50 percent disapproval of Eisner at the 2003 Disney shareholders meeting. <br /> <br />In addition to Eisner's questionable management skills, Stewart also sheds light on a litany of decisions that Eisner poo pooed (passing on both Survivor and the Apprentice) seemed to have little faith in (Sixth Sense, Finding Nemo, etc.), or were just reckless and bad (overpaying for Fox Family, Euro Disney).  Eisner seemed little interested in the animation division when he took over, and Stewart clearly assigns almost exclusive credit for rescuing Disney animation from the brink to Katzenberg (a view largely verified when you consider that almost all the post-Katzenberg animation successes came from Pixar, not Disney, who merely acts as a distributor of Pixar films).   <br /> <br />The one question left unanswered by Stewart is perhaps unknowable, the internal, \\"what makes him tick\\" question that drove Eisner to litigate Katzenberg's severence (stewart suggests that what could have been a $50 million settlement ended up rising to 280 because of Eisner's intransigence), undercut his chosen #2 Ovitz and then allow him to leave after 18 months to the tune of $140 million, and the revolving door nature of upper management around him.  Stewart damns with faint praise by leaving until the end the \\"greatest hits\\" bullet points of Eisner's tenure, the exponential expansion of the company's market cap, share value, etc. and instead spends most of the 500 page book (which by the way reads quickly) detailing the many slip ups, miscues and bad decisions of the Eisner era.  Self-serving vignettes where Stewart is allowed \\"fly on the wall\\" access to Eisner meetings are just that, having the literary equivalent of Trump's bogus \\"meeting\\" segments during \\"The Apprentice.\\"  <br /> <br />This is a great book that sheds light on the internal workings of a large corporation but also serves as validation to the long ago observation that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. <br /> <br />	2005-05-16

I can certainly appreciate his criticism of the empiricist verifiability theory of meaning. The logical positivists had sought to bring science and philosophy into a cohesive discipline -- certainly a respectable goal. Yet by 1935, the verifiability criterion was dogged by powerful criticism. Popper himself was aware of these problems. Popper wisely observes that \\"the radical positivist would destroy not only metaphysics, but also natural science.\\" For instance, scientific laws are not a composite of all observed cases. They are generalizations that hold for _all_ cases, observed and unobserved, whether taking place now, or in the past, or in the future. But such a law, like the law of gravity, is on the positivist's own ground unverifiable and therefore meaningless. For the positivist, with his esteem for science, this was damning.<br /><br />The verifiability theory was in trouble. Popper's solution, however, is hardly adequate. He knew that universal statements of scientific law were meaningful even though they could not be verified. Thus he proposed that it was not verifiability that determined meaningfulness, but _falsifiability_. If we say \\"All roses are red,\\" this would be meaningful, because it is falsifiable by the experience of finding a rose colored differently. However, the asymmetry between verifiability and falsifiability completely unravels Popper's case. You could _never_ falsify a logically particular statement (like \\"Some ravens are black\\"), because such would require a universal negative (\\"No ravens are black\\") -- a proposition that could never be proven on empiricist terms. On Popper's own terms, \\"Some ravens are black\\" would be a meaningless statement. This can hardly be what he anticipated.<br /><br />Hopefully this whole empiricist zeitgeist will die off. It irks me bad.	2005-05-12

As man's experience has changed in the modern era, so must philosophy change; philosophy must evolve in order to explicitly address those issues from which it originally arose - those dealing with the everyday concerns of man. It is contemporary philosophy's (in 1919) detachment from man's real life and goals that Dewey wishes to diagnose and address. Philosophy must break the bonds of tradition and become entirely secular; the scientific method which revolutionized man's life must be embraced by philosophy - the facts and experience oriented spirit of science must pervade the reconstruction of philosophy.<br /><br /> It is the rise of science as the great shaper of human life and culture that constitutes the greatest change in human experience. Pre-historic man's life - which, according to Dewey, consisted of brief periods of food gathering and the rest of long periods of reverie - gave rise to conceptions of the nature of man and the world. As men's culture advanced, so did men's accounts of the nature of man and the world; these developments culminated in the works of the classic ancient thinkers, notably Plato and Aristotle. These were philosophies that denigrated ugly matter and imperfect change, and idealized perfect, eternal forms. These philosophies, and those in modern times which carry their influence, place ultimate value and ultimate reality in otherworldly or extra-sensory things - in the Forms, Celestial Spheres, the Categories, etc.<br /><br /> The Pragmatic method proposed by Dewey seeks to dispense with the old dichotomies and idealizations and transform knowledge and philosophy from the \\"contemplative to the operative.\\" Science broke the old dogmas about the physical universe and philosophy should similarly make experience the test of our principles; abstractions, principles, generalizations, etc. should service concrete action, not the other way around. \\"The true is the verified,\\" writes Dewey. This is the method by which logic, epistemology, morals, politics, etc. should base its reconstruction.<br /><br /> Dewey's program, it may be argued, only serves to relocate rather than resolve some of the main issues of philosophy. How exactly the methods of science are to be absorbed by philosophy, and whether philosophy does in fact differ from the sciences only in its degree of generality are unanswered questions. While deriding \\"fixed and final\\" end in ethics, Dewey posits \\"growth itself as the only moral end.\\" And by defining society as \\"the process of associating in such ways that experiences, ideas, emotions, and values are transmitted and made common,\\" he makes both the individual and the state subordinate to this process. Have we not traded one thing to subordinate ourselves to for another? This is not to say that Dewey doesn't offer a framework that perhaps allows us to offer more satisfying answers to philosophy's issues (which is just what Dewey argues for); its just that he is proposing a new methodology for answering those issues, not (in this work at least) offering specific answers, or defending in a satisfying way the assertion that his program is in the first place tenable. These comments aren't mean to trivialize Dewey's program offhand, but to point out the sort of questions he raises which should be answered.<br /><br /> For a much more fruitful and rigorous defense of a pragmatic-type approach to some of philosophy's central issues, see Susan Haack's Evidence and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology (for the title of which she borrowed from Dewey). This work by Dewey, however, is required reading for those who wish to study the American Pragmatist school.ions, etc. should service concrete action, not the other way around. \\"The true is the verified,\\" writes Dewey.

I've read numerous Linda Howard books and realized this was my least favorite about halfway through the story.  DREAM MAN lacked the normal zing and fervor in which she usually brings to the written page.<br /><br />Marlie Keen is an empath, a type of psychic, who is uncomfortable in revealing her powers to anyone, thus keeping everyone at a distance.  Six years ago, she endured a killer's attempted revenge, only to be traumatized to the point of having no powers.  When these return, she is thrown into mind of a vicious killer.  After going to the police, she is doubted and considered an accomplice.  Once her alibi is verified, Detective Dane Hollister gives in to his instant attraction.<br /><br />When Marlie has another vision, she calls Dane, who immediately rushes to her side.  After witnessing the trauma a vision causes Marlie, he is determined to protect her at all costs.  He moves into her home and invades all aspects of her life.  Invades and conquers... it was more like a Viking domineering his woman.<br /><br />The problem right from the start of this book is Dane's incredible attraction to Marlie.  They argue and act like children who are attracted to each other.  When Dane decides that he wants to be involved with her, he snaps his fingers and expects Marlie to fall in line.  At this point, she loses her spunk and becomes a dishrag doll happy to be the obedient girlfriend.  The strong character the reader is introduced to is snuffed out and replaced with a shell.<br /><br />The story lags when Marlie and Dane are not on the trail of the serial killer.  We're given hot and steam sex scene after sex scene, with little intellectual meat.  Basically if Marlie isn't having a vision of the killer stalking and/or slashing his next victim, she's tossed into bed by Dane and expected to perform.<br /><br />DREAM MAN is definitely not high on my reading list.  I'd much rather read MR. PERFECT or KILL AND TELL.  This is an average book that isn't up to the usual excellence of Linda Howard.the usual excellence of Linda Howard. <br />	2005-05-09

Of course that is mere opinion but your opinions of this historical writing is obviously perverted. The 911 attack is well proven as an inside job at least in part if you read the book you couldn't disargee. Dr Griffin didn't make this stuff up Your government did the making up part and with zero proof and even less accountability. <br /> For what purpose do you suppose Dr Griffin a retired man in his 60's whom is highly respected in his field would have for approaching this very dangerous subject. Personal gain? I think not. Concern for his country and his planet? More likely. Dr Griffin makes a point to suggest to his readers to do research to find the truth. Don't take his word for it. As many readers already have found, his writings are the truth and they meet the test. Try finding sources that can be verified with the \\"official version\\" you will be waiting for fifty years for that to become public record of course.  <br />This book is an excellent collection of the many 911 Truth seekers and researchers both here in the US and those from other countries. The information is not presented as final truths but simply presented as clarification that the official claims are bold face lies.  <br />We need a REAL investigation to find the actual truth I suggest this book as a starting point for those investigators. That is the point of Dr Griffins writings of recent years both this book and The New Pearl Harbor are important must reads in the non-fiction category. If ficition is more your style you'll love  the \\"official version\\" it is a good read too bad nothing in it is true. <br />To dismiss this highly respected Professors' writing is to disgrace yourself and your country for you cannot claim to be for America and ignore the facts. Finding the truth about 911 is what makes the real patriots rise up and the false ones can simply continue to offer us nothing but rants and distractions.	2005-05-09

From Cairo to Cape Town Paul travels along the worst roads and through the toughest villages that you won't see on a tourist safari, talking with and learning from everyone he meets along the way. From that perspective this was the most educational travel book to date that I've seen.<br /><br />One of the consistent observations throughout the book is that wherever Paul traveled the detriment brought to Africa by aid workers is quite clear. Aid is not helping, and it never did. It only contributes to the under-development in Africa and only serves to keep the local despots and corrupt, stagnated governments in power. In Malawi, as in the much of the rest of Africa, the NGOs (Non-governmental Organizations) and virtue activists hire away the local teachers (who only make $27 to $67 dollars a month) offering them better pay and conditions to become food distributors. Few of the villages even have teachers any more.<br /><br />The author speaks with a knowledge and history of Africa that few others possess since he had lived and worked as a teacher in Africa during the 1960s. As Paul states, foreign aid workers \\"…didn't realize that for forty years people had been saying the same things, and the result, after four decades, was a lower standard of living, a higher rate of illiteracy, over population, and much more disease. Foreigners working for development agencies didn't stand long. So they never discovered the full extent of their failure. Africans saw them come and go.\\"<br /><br />Labor-intensive projects are extremely rare in Africa because of self-serving foreign \\"aid\\" that require \\"purchases of machinery have to be made in the donor country, or that bids be restricted to firms in the donor country, or that a time limit be placed on the scheme which encourages the tendency towards large contracts and heavy spending on equipment.\\" Paul also verifies what I had first read about in Jim Roger's Adventure Capitalist. All of the used clothing donated to churches to be distributed to \\"poor Africa\\" becomes merchandise the second the cargo ship leaves the port. When it reaches its destination it's purchased in large blocks by merchants who resell them. The author picks up some \\"new\\" clothes himself in order to avoid looking like a tourist. His T-shirt read \\"Top-Notch Plumbing\\". Of course, all this \\"good-well aid\\" does nothing but to hurt Africa's economy. There was a time, not too long ago, when some of the best tailors in the world were in Africa. But how can you be a tailor when the West sends clothes over for practically free? Why be a farmer when the West wants to feed you for free? What's the best industry in Kenya? Coffins. Coffin-making is a booming industry. In one area of Malawi the people are growing their own Maize crops but are using hybrid seeds resulting in big plants but sterile seeds. The farmers can't set aside plants as seed corn because they are all sterile! As Theroux says, \\"Without free seeds each year these people would starve.\\"<br /><br />What angers me the most though is what I have seen verified in other reports, namely aid workers \\"were no more than a maintenance crew on a power trip\\". Other than a Nun or two who had moved to Africa on their own accord, none of the aid workers, in other words the NGO aid workers, were happy to be there or in the slightest bit helpful to the author. They're all too busy driving around in their air-conditioned Land Rovers to get out and actually help people.<br /><br />The happiest and most self-sufficient villages that Theroux encountered were, in a very consistent pattern, all out-of-the-way such that the government and aid workers ignored then and didn't mess with them.<br /><br />There is much more to the book though than state of Africa's corruption. The author's adventures are incredible. It's incredible that he actually lived to tell the tale actually. If you want a romantic story of big-game hunters in Africa, ready Hemingway. If you want reality, read Theroux.n Africa, ready Hemingway. If you want reality, read Theroux.	2005-05-06

I started it preparing myself for a hatchet job, but found, slightly to my disappointment, much that was well-balanced and reasonable. <br />The first chapters contained unverified statements about child psychology.such as \\"overprotected kids do not flourish.\\" I'll leave the dodgeball issue to NASPE members. <br />The accounts of Maslow and Carl Rogers and the encounter therapies of the sixties flog some dead horses (Maslow died in 1970 and Carl Rogers in1987). <br />Chapter 3, from Sin to Syndrome, hits some easy targets in examples of psychiatric defenses in criminal cases, but is rather superficial. I'd agree with what they say about the management of pedophiles. I think they shortchange the possibility of abnormal brain chemistry leading to addiction, but they talk excellent sense about the brain imaging studies.  <br />Chapter four contains a useful summary of what is know about the course and therapy of bereavement.  I'd recommend it to any student who doesn't have time to read Zisook  (\\"Biopsychosocial Aspects of Bereavement\\") or Parkes.  The discussion of PTSD and its treatment is well informed and helpful. The evidence about support groups for medical illnesses is dealt with fairly. Perhaps it's an unfair shot but, after looking at the jacket photographs, one rather wonders about the authors' credentials for pontificating about combat veterans.  <br /> Chapter five deals with the emergency psychotherapeutic response to disaster in scathing and nihilistic terms that are probably well justified but become repetitious after having made the well-worn observation that the usefulness of debriefing is questionable. <br />I didn't find it highly readable.  Maybe that's because it's not polemical and biased enough. It's largely made up of summaries of other people's writings and some of the best bits are quotations from others, such as the man offered bereavement counseling after the death of his 105 year old aunt. <br />	2005-05-06

It was a great concept-insane mother loses son, her favorite child, forces his twin sister to impersonate him in a bizarre case of cross-dressing.  It did remind me quite a bit of Flowers of the Attic, particularly because it involves a smothering mother we grow to resent for imprisoning her children-in Flowers, literally, in this book, figuratively. <br /> <br />What is poor Celeste to do?  She's extremely young, only 9 years old, her father and brother have died, and her whole life is her mother.  She grew up home-schooled, isolated, and lonely.  There is no one to turn to, and her mother is her caretaker.  She also blames herself for Noble's death.  So she becomes him.  It's really a unique story and different in so many ways than a lot of the other post-Andrews ones.   <br /> <br />I also liked the suggestion of the supernatural, the first time this has ever happened in an Andrews book.  However, the question is never really resolved in all three books of the Gemini series.  It's suggested that Celeste, her mother, and daughter, all have a gift, but never verified, so you're left wondering if they're crazy, (the mother certainly seems to be) or cursed (Celeste's daughter, in \\"child of darkness\\", seems to have accurately foretold the tragic death of a schoolmistress, so I'm not sure). <br /> <br />  There's a lot of contradictory stuff in this series, and the timeline doesn't always add up, but it's worth a read.  You'll have fun, I promise.	2005-05-03
US	50297005	R3TSEYK4JKDCLR	0830719377	710688692	Informed Intercession	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Book summary	Spiritual mapping is a form of cultural geography or cultural anthropology aiming for a fuller understanding of the nature and origin of any obstacle to revival and to receive God's prescribed strategies for their removal. Spiritual mapping may focus on people's spiritual worldview and allegiance, moral choices, the resulting patterns of behavior, and social reputation. Spiritual mapping superimposes a Christian's understanding of forces and events in the spiritual domain onto seemingly natural circumstances and places. The veiled realities include angels and other divine resources , , , territorial or psychic demonic strongholds, quid pro quo spiritual pacts to handle individual or corporate trauma, repressed hurts associated with unresolved social injustice. Dark supernatural powers really exist, not simply appear to be. Western Christianity has lost the ability to recognize the spiritual dimension, having embraced an anti-supernatural worldview. Spiritual mapping equips the church to discern and to navigate the spiritual dimensions in its ministries. Spiritual mapping does not substitute prayer or evangelism, but can render both more effective.<br /><br />(A) Spiritual Mapping's Scope & Contents:<br /><br />The scope of a spiritual mapping project may be a neighborhood, a city, a region, a people group, or a virtual online community. Civic and legal boundaries are often arbitrary and do not reflect socio-cultural realities and spiritual domains. For example, Navajo tribal members, spread over Arizona and New Mexico and Utah, are more concerned with traditional boundaries rooted in tribal myths than with state boundaries; colonial and thus modern borders of African countries often bisect ancient tribal homelands; immigrant groups may maintain strong ties with their home culture and religion.<br /><br />Spiritual mapping asks what are wrong with one's community. To that end, one may characterize the community's status of Christianity, worldviews and allegiances, spiritual opposition, and prevailing social bondages. There needs to be a balance between sensitivity and candor; both judgmental and rose-colored attitudes need to be avoided. With respect to Christianity's status --- Are old revival fires still burning, or has the fervor of previous years given way to liberal lukewarm religion? What is the status of current evangelistic initiatives? What is the community's perception of the church? As a relevant force or an outmoded institution? In relation to worldviews and allegiances, identify important underlying religious and secular philosophies, ideologies, or mind-sets. With respect of prevailing social bondages --- Outward evidence of spiritual darkness needs to be gathered. There needs a cataloging of the conditions of externally inflicted pain like disease, poverty, injustice and violence. There needs to be an assessment of the nature and prevalence of self-destructive vices, such as gambling, sexual immorality, pornography, and prostitution. There also needs to be a characterization of any disintegration of stabilizing social values and structures, with the symptoms being corruption and divorce. Are there new militancy among sinners? What role may the media have in promoting spiritual darkness in the community? Concerning spiritual opposition, look out for such things as witchcraft, anti-Christian legislation, economic discrimination, public mockery and physical persecution.<br /><br />Spiritual mapping also asks how various past influences are woven together to form distinct cultures and communities, as well as their collective knowledge. This is because present realities often stemmed from previous generations' attitudes and actions; and earlier events help shape present realities. In exploring how the above-characterized present state of the community came about, investigate confluent events like natural disasters, military invasions, the influx of new religions. Plot these on time lines. Investigate how such factorsalter the life and identity of the community, if the inhabitants of the time attempted to resolve traumatic circumstances by entering into pacts with the spirit world, and if their actions compounded or modified earlier arrangements. To present attitudes in terms of their geographical distribution, one could indicate on a map the locations of evangelical churches, and deceptive centers, commercial sex centers - that can give a good idea where various problems are concentrated. Sometimes certain locations may emerge as centers of idolatry and demonic attention.<br /><br />Spiritual mapping furthermore asks about the community's potentials for spiritual change. Ask if the church has positioned itself for action by cultivating unit, holiness and prayer. What is the quality of intercession? God may already have begun to break up strongholds if there exist large-scale conversions, social reconciliation, and/or public miracles.<br /><br />(B) Spiritual Mapping's Personnel, Attitude & Process:<br /><br />The spiritual-mapping team should be motivated by a passion for lost souls, commitment to community, a servant attitude to serve their fellow researchers and the spiritually lost whose circumstances they are investigating, and be accountable. Inflated egos, personal agendas, dictatorial personalities should be avoided. The spiritual mapping team leader must exercise considerable wisdom and patience and humility, must command the respect and attention of all other members; and adeptness with facts and figures means nothing if the leader is inept at social interaction. The spiritual mapping team consists of three units: (1) The archival unit needs to be killed at culling information from secondary sources, such as books, journals, dissertations and maps. (2) The field unit consists of \\"people persons\\" thriving at social interaction, keen observers and wise judges of character, and able to extract information from observation and personal interviews. This unit's members conduct interviews with people of thorough understanding of the vocabulary, history and rituals of the targeted cultural environment - especially tradition bearers with unique roles or performance skills, good memories and long lives. Members need to display genuine interest and curiosity. (3) The intercessory unit awaits the Holy Spirit's promptings and revelations. Insights gleaned from prayer need to be verified and supplemented with objective evidence. Bizarre maps might claim divine revelation but are based on inadequate surveying, detached from objective supporting evidence, based on theological dogma and imaginative thinking. The intercessory unit can also pray for wisdom in selecting proper boundaries and scheduling and evaluating people and information, that colleagues be led to hidden or confirming sources and find favor with respondents and be granted divine protection, that God will prepare a ready audience for the final report.<br /><br />Divine guidance and revelation to Christians flows out of relationship with Him. Paul named prophecy as a highly desirable spiritual gift . God calls a Christian by name; and a Christian follows Christ because he/she knows Christ's voice , . This process is intimate, natural, and not uncommon , , e.g. Paul's Macedonian vision . (These last 3 verses are not directly relevant, these verses do not directly concern cognitive spiritual mapping, but situational guidance.) God's revelations are not magical, though not impervious to human error. Human conclusions regarding divine revelation need be tested against Scripture, mature counsel, and objective social-science research. God reveals his secrets and commands his blessings also to those serious enough to make relational and territorial covenants with a community. Lacking active engagement (not merely passive lingering) with a community, a person is less likely to know and care for the place they live in. Though spiritual mapping might appeal to some migrants, spiritual mappingbecomes a quest for knowledge not to change communities.<br /><br />If community churches are not yet united in prayer or if no evident passion exists for the lost, a spiritual-mapping project may be premature. One may then instead pray for an appetite in the church for unity, prayer and evangelism. The best intelligence would be useless if no one is interested in it.<br /><br />Like missionaries and church planters, the spiritual-mapping team is best sent out by a commissioning authority to provide a leadership structure to hold expectations for the team and to provide spiritual accountability. The commissioning should be a public affair to formalize a \\"protective custody\\" and to explain the spiritual mapping plan vis-&agrave;-vis the larger Christian community and to solicit support.<br /><br />(C) Comments on Otis' Use of Biblical Verses:<br /><br />Otis often uses poor Biblical theology, taking versus out of contexts. For example, he misquoted the following verses: 2 Chronicles 7:14  refers to forgiveness granted to the community that repents, not (as Otis implies) to some other \\"community\\" that one hopes to transform; Jeremiah 29:13-14  mentions God allowing himself found, not (as Otis implies) that the targeted community will be successfully transformed; John 15:7  does not guarantee (as Otis implies) that a desire for a successful community transformation is necessarily compatible to \\"If you abide in me, and my words abide in you\\"; James 5:16  refers to what happens among Christians themselves, not (as Otis implies) Christians' intercession for non-Christians. 1 John 3:21-22,  does not mean (as Otis implies) a desire for a successful \\"community transformation\\" is necessarily compatible to \\"if our hearts do not condemn us\\".ews. This unit's members conduct interviews with people of thorough understanding of the vocabulary, history and rituals of the targeted cultural environment - especially tradition bearers with unique roles or performance skills, good memories and long lives. Members need to display genuine interest and curiosity. (3) The intercessory unit awaits the Holy Spirit's promptings and revelations.

For example, he misquoted the following verses: 2 Chronicles 7:14  refers to forgiveness granted to the community that repents, not (as Otis implies) to some other \\"community\\" that one hopes to transform; Jeremiah 29:13-14  mentions God allowing himself found, not (as Otis implies) that the targeted community will be successfully transformed; John 15:7  does not guarantee (as Otis implies) that a desire for a successful community transformation is necessarily compatible to \\"If you abide in me, and my words abide in you\\"; James 5:16  refers to what happens among Christians themselves, not (as Otis implies) Christians' intercession for non-Christians. 1 John 3:21-22,  does not mean (as Otis implies) a desire for a successful \\"community transformation\\" is necessarily compatible to \\"if our hearts do not condemn us\\". <br />	2005-05-03

These multiple authors speak with one voice, enriched by their varied perspectives. Much overlapping in substance exists across chapters. The book's tone is informal throughout, like a series of \\"prep talks\\". <br /> <br />George Otis, Jr. defines \\"spiritual mapping\\" as superimposing Christian \\"understanding of forces and events in the spiritual domain\\" to see beneath geographical patterns of evil and spiritual oppression. This assumes in the practitioner \\"a keen understanding of the spiritual domain\\" and \\"a skill born out of a right relationship with God and a love for his world\\". Spiritual mapping's conclusions, to be verified by the Bible and sociological-historical observation, can enhance the effectiveness of ministry. George Otis, Jr. further describes a \\"territorial stronghold\\" as an evil spiritual being ruling over an explicitly proscribed area (e.g. a home, a village, a city, a valley, or a nation), possibly with hierarchies of deities and spirits. Such a territorial spirit may exercise extraordinary power over the area's local people. A \\"territorial stronghold\\" wards off divine influence and may invade unprotected targets abroad. A territorial stronghold, allowed into an area by earlier generations' misplaced choices, may be consciously affirmed in the contemporary generation's religious festivals and ceremonials and pilgrimages. <br /> <br />Cindy Jacobs (of a prayer networking organization called Generals of Intercession) enumerates nine additional strongholds, where Satan exalts himself against human knowledge of God and against God's plans. A personal stronghold (such as personal sin, pride, selfishness or desire for power) needs be repented of. A hopeless mindset stronghold \\"causes the believer to accept as unchangeable something he or she knows is contrary to the will of God.\\"  A sectarian stronghold causes pride in doctrines, idolatry of denominations, and divisions among churches. Moreover, instead of a church's \\"us versus them\\" mentality, the church should lend itself as a helpful resource to its local population. A social stronghold exists when poverty or oppression  (such as injustice, racism) causes \\"people to believe God does not care about their needs\\". An ideological stronghold influences entire cultures and societies. An occultic stronghold (such as witchcraft, Satanism, and New Age religions) is \\"an overt evil application of many ideological strongholds\\". Cindy Jacobs cited her experience in breaking occultic strongholds: once through corporate repentance among Christians in the Argentine city of Rosario of earlier generations' worship of the Queen of Heaven, and once through Christians' intercession against a \\"curse\\" on Cindy Jacobs' personal health. A \\"seat of Satan\\" is a \\"highly oppressed and demonically controlled\\" geographical location from which Satan wars against a larger region. A \\"stronghold of iniquity\\" stems from earlier generations' sins producing weaknesses or iniquities in later generations. <br /> <br />Kjell Sjoberg of Sweden emphasized that spiritual mapping helps to target intercession. Among his insights are the followings: A believer's unconfessed guilt invited demonic influence on that believer; a believer's confession must precede his/her spiritual warfare. God's promises in the Old Testament for particular nations can be used in prayer for those nations. God might sometimes urge believers to gather for prayer without the believers knowing why; later those occasions might turn out to coincide with high levels of occultic activities. Human opposition could signify correct targeting in the Christians' spiritual warfare. <br /> <br />Harold Caballeros, a pastor in Guatemala, had been reading Matthew 12:29 , Mark 3:27  and Luke 11:21,22 . A believer told him of her dreaming of three rough rustic hands holding transparent ropes joining three specific Guatemalan cities. Another believer, upon hearing this dream, named the three persons holding the ropes. Subsequent investigations revealed those three persons were conducting \\"evil works of the devil\\" in those three cities, through money, politics and drug dealing. After \\"on-site prayer\\", the first was jailed awaiting trial, the second lost his office, and the third's power was greatly diminished. There was then less violence and more fruitful evangelism. In another situation, Caballeros' research team identified an archaeological site of Mayan idolatry and witchcraft, plus a vacant house there where contemporary idolatry and witchcraft was occurring. Caballeros' prayer team reported that God described to them the person responsible, including his appearance. Caballeros' prayer team was also told on what page of the next day's newspaper that person's name will be identified. All these came true; and further research indicated that person named in the newspaper indeed owned the aforementioned house.  <br /> <br />Victor Lorenzo, of Harvest Evangelism in Argentina, was initially reluctant to obey God's call to strategic spiritual warfare. This opened his baby son to sickness due to demonic attack. As Lorenzo repented, an angel assured him of subsequent protection of his son. Based on information from five local professors and prominent murals of the city of Resistencia, the spirits of death, fear, sexual perversion, witchcraft/sorcery, Freemasonry, and the Queen of Heaven were discerned. Lorenzo's team's targeted prayers resulted in evangelistic success and doubled church attendance across all social strata, effective social service ministries, and positive media exposure. However, bitterness among certain pastors was not entirely healed in Resistencia. In a subsequent project for the city of La Plata, Lorenzo's intercession team members independently felt led by God to spotlight freemasonry. Lorenzo later found that La Plata's city center was indeed laid out as a freemasonry temple, with public statutes and monuments bearing Masonic symbolism. At the time of writing, many local believers were following up with fervent targeted intercession, sometimes on location in the city's Masonic landmarks. <br /> <br />Mark McGregor (a Seattle computer programmer) applied to Seattle the 20-question spiritual-mapping approach in John Dawson's Taking Our Cities for God; and Bev Klopp (of Gateway Ministries) planned follow-up prayers and actions of strategic spiritual warfare for Seattle. <br />	2005-05-03

At the very least, for those of you who vehemently disagree with the author's conclusions, it's a great starting point for researching further and perhaps dismissing his claims. <br /> <br />I had been exposed to the idea that 9/11 was planned before I began reading The New Pearl Harbor, but in limited doses and disparate information.  This book was, for me, a nice way of gathering those conspiracy theories into a consolidated account. <br /> <br />I admit the very idea of 9/11 being a ruse seemed unbelievable to me, but as I read through some of Griffin's chapters (especially the one dealing with the response of the air force and another on how the towers collapsed) I began to think there may be something to these claims. <br /> <br />However, my main criticism of this book is its reliance on the analysis of these events by other authors.  Rather than investigating source materials and making his own analysis, Griffin has simply gathered material from other writers on this subject.  In other words, this book is mainly a catalog of the theories of other people.  Very little of The New Pearl Harbor contains the actual views of Griffin, although what little he does venture to claim makes it quite clear what he thinks is the case with regard to the culpability of the Bush administration and/or the military establishment. <br /> <br />All in all, even though this book has weaknesses, its strength is in pointing out the glaring absurdities of the established account of the events of 9/11.  But, it is important to remember that this book should be verified against other information (as with anything I suppose).	2005-05-01

(Chronology, No. 1)	Books	5	62	78	N	N	History and Astronomy are not compatible	This is a most unusual book, one that undermines the very foundations of History. According to the author and his team of researchers, History as it has been taught in Europe ever since the Renaissance is fundamentally false, verified history beginning around 1250 AD the earliest. Jesus Christ was born in 1053 and crucified in 1086, the First Crusade being an immediate reaction to his Crucifixion. Homer identifies an an anonymous poet of the second half of XIII century AD, and the event led to the creation of the Iliad had been the fall of the Latin Empire of Constantinople in 1261 AD. The list goes on and on.    Historians generally oppose the author's views without making much commentary. The author is not a historian, they say, period. He is only a leading differential geometrician, successful and respected, author of many advanced textbooks. A. Fomenko is also a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences; his main argumentation is of a statistical and astronomical nature. I  happen to be a physicist myself and not a historian. However, astronomy and differential geometry are known to me well from the area of general relativity, and I cannot recommend this book enough, since its author approaches History, usually a highly emotional discipline ascribed to the field of humanities, armed with impartial mathematics.   History is collective memory; yet even our own memory errs at times, and no real memory extends beyond three generations. There are written sources, but each one of those might easily prove a forgery. There are material remnants of archaeological nature, but they may be misadated and misinterpreted.   Astronomy is precise by definition, and a historical dating that can be calculated from information about eclipses should satisfy any researcher. Yet the XIX century astronomers did not use the lunar tidal friction value in the equations of lunar motion, which would make ancient lunar eclipses appear several hours off the mark and relocate completely several total eclipses of the sun geographically (assuming tidal friction value has remained the same all the time but there is no reason to believe it hasn't). How could XIX century calculations have conformed to consensual history?   I must say that a methodical recalculation of ancient eclipse datings shall invariably bring surprises; in the unlikely case these datings are correct, we shall prove the existence of erratic changes in telluric rotation over the last 4,000 years instead. Both possibilities are highly alarming.   Fomenko demonstrates the incompatibility between consensual history and modern astronomy. This incompatibility is a sad fact. (He exposes a number of other contentious issues as well, but those do not fall into my professional scope). Which is more reliable - history or hard-boiled scientific facts? Science cannot afford subjectivity; most of us would feel the same way about history as well.    Chronological problems are very serious indeed; Fomenko offers a viable solution to most of them, and a radical one at that - a \\"Copernican revolution\\" of history, no less. I am not using the term to predict the final and total victory of his version; that is a matter for a multitude of scientific and scholarly discussions to come. But the contradiction between history and astronomy that becomes graver with the day cannot and must not be tolerated, in the best interests of both history and the theory of telluric rotation.

Packed with verified statistics (references given), this is not simply a dry and boring text - there is at least one full colour photograph of each racial group along with a full page writeup of their culture, beliefs, location, language and ethnic history. <br />At the front is an overview of China, Chinese (both the people and the language) and a background of the contents and methods used to collect it. <br /> <br />This book is fascinating to me, a long-term student of Chinese, and a Christian in a Chinese Church. For days I flipped through it reading more and more interesting material - I couldn't put it down! <br /> <br />One aspect jumped out at me, and that is the small graph on each page describing the proportion of people who had not heard the Gospel, the proportion who don't (yet) believe after hearing the Gospel, and the proportion of practicing Christians.  What jumped out was the graph for the Lisu people. Whereas most graphs showed 80 to 90% had not heard the Gospel, and only 4 or 5% were practicing Chrisitans, the Lisu were different with over 40% being practicing Christians. Why? Whilst it is hinted at in the text, I'm convinced that this is mostly the result of one man giving up over 20 years of his life to work as missionary in Lisuland: James O Fraser. He laboured year in, year out, taking more than 5 years before seeing his first convert, until finally the Holy Spirit swept through those villages like a storm. So strong were the conversions that the Lisu, perhaps alone of all Chinese races, survived the Cultural Revolution with their church intact.  <br /> <br />This shows the difference that one soul can make to this world. Maybe this could be *you* in future?	2005-04-26

The time when she met Bill Clinton (they have been together since), no one knew he wud be President.  <br /> <br />She does do some explaining for Whitewater, and though lots of people may not believe her, it was interesting to learn that they were investigated for losing money in that investment (one wud think they made millions on it). I even verified with the Whitewater reports online that ultimately the Clintons were given a complete clean chit on this.  <br /> <br />The book is self-serving in many respects, which could have been avoided and is off-putting. Last but not the least, I do feel that Hillary Clinton has a larger than life persona and can be pretty tough as nails. But really - she is a politician and has been one for a very long time.

I will list 7 unscriptural teachings that I found in this book. I'm sure there are others, but these are the ones that jumped out to me.<br /><br />First, Smith Wigglesworth teaches throughout this book that sickness is always demonic and it is caused by sin. According to Wigglesworth there is no other possible cause for sickness. He also teaches repeatidly that if a person is not healed, the reason is a lack of faith.<br /><br />The Bible, however teaches something very different. Yes, sickness can be the result of sin. For example, Miriam being struck with leprosy. But that is not the ONLY cause of sickness in Scripture. the Bible lists at least two other causes.<br /><br /> In fact, Jesus Himself confronted this very issue. Right before He healed the man born blind, someone asked Him \\"Who sinned, this man or his parents?\\" John 9:22-23 give Jesus's response. He replied \\"Neither this man nor his parents sinned. But this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.\\"<br /><br />Another verse that refutes this teaching is Exodus 4:11 which says \\"Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the Lord?\\"<br /><br />A second possible cause of sickness according to Scripture is that it comes from Satan. The best example of this is Job. But Jesus also heals a woman who couldn't stand upright as the result of a spirit (Luke 13:11-13)<br /><br />In his excellent book \\"Charismatic Chaos\\" John MacArthur has this to say \\"Suggesting that someone's sickness is necessarily related to personal sin is as unfeeling and cruel as telling people they are not healed because they lack faith.\\" I wholeheartidly agree. Yet, that is precisely what Wigglesworth does over and over again in this book.<br /><br />The second area of concern is where Wigglesworth says that he questions whether the Holy Spirit is truly present without the gifts of the Spirit (specifically tongues and healing) That teaching has no basis in Scripture whatsoever. Yes, there were times where amazing things happened and the gifts of the Spirit were present, for example at Pentecost. But there are numerous other examples where the gifts of the Spirit are not even mentioned. This is not an either/or it's a both/and. Sometimes the gifts will be present when the Spirit moves, sometimes they will not.<br /><br />Third, Wigglesworth teaches that even someone who lacks character can see the Lord. This is refuted in Psalm 66:18 as well as in 1st John 3:6 and 1st John 5:18<br /><br />Fourth, one of the teachings I found most disturbing is where Wigglesworth says \\"Do not say \\"I was saved by faith\\" or \\"I was healed by faith.\\" Faith does not save or heal.\\"<br /><br />Jesus said numerous times that faith DOES heal and save. So, either Wigglesworth is wrong, or Jesus is. But they can't both be true.<br /><br />For example, to the woman who had an issue of blood for 12 years, Jesus said \\"Go, your faith has healed you.\\" This story is repeated in Mark and Luke also.<br /><br />Jesus also said the same thing to the blind beggar whose story is told in Luke 18:42<br /><br />Jesus also told people their faith had saved them. For example, the sinner woman in the house of Simon the Pharasee Jesus told her. \\"Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.\\" Other Scriptures that contradict this teaching are Romans 5:1, Romans 3 and Hebrews 11. In addition Ephesians 2:8 says For it is by grace you have been saved, THROUGH FAITH (emphasis mine)<br /><br />Fifth, there are at least two instances that Wigglesworth claims to have seen Jesus. Once, he claims Jesus appeared at the bed of a sick woman and smiled at him. Another time, Wigglesworth claims to have seen Jesus pass by his window. He describes both encounters in a flippant and casual manner. This bears littleresemblence to people in Scripture who saw the Risen Christ. For example, Isaiah. When He saw Christ he replied \\"Woe is me, for I am undone!\\" In Revelation 1, John describes what happened when He saw Christ. John tells us he \\"fell down as though dead.\\" Paul is another example. His life was radically changed after his encounter with the risen Christ. The same is true of the Apostles after they saw Christ after his ressurection.<br /><br />Sixth, Wigglesworth claims that the reason Ananais and Sapphira were killed is because they doubted God and lacked faith. In Acts 5 tells us exactly why Ananais and Sapphira lost their lives. Peter tells us it was because of their greed and because they lied to the Holy Spirit. To be fair, I think an arguement could be made that it was a lack of faith. But the evidence for that in the biblical account is slim at best. It is dangerous to read something into Scripture that isn't there or to base a doctrine on one verse, taken out of context.<br /><br />Lastly, in one instance, Wigglesworth claims that a man experienced a temporary, partial healing and that he had to pray for the man a second time in order for him to be fully healed. Now, let me say this. I do believe that God still heals today. But I also believe that Satan can counterfit healings. I believe, that is what most, if not all of the \\"healings\\" performed by Wigglesworth were. Also, as with most Charismatics, the healings were for mainly for internal problems. Wigglesworth almost never says that the \\"healing\\" was verified by a doctor. Anyone who knows even a little about Scripture knows that Jesus performed numerous healings, as did the Apostles after Pentecost. Peter and Paul also healed people. Every single time, without exception, when someone was healed in Scripture, three things happened. The healing was total, immediate and permanent. No one who was healed ever had to come back to be healed a second time. Jesus never once partially healed a disease or physical ailment. He healed the person completely so that no trace of the sickness or disease remained.<br /><br />I wish I could say that this type of error is unique to Wigglesworth. Sadly, it's not. In fact, there are many other Charismatic authors who teach the same errors. Every Christian, especially those involved with the Charismatic Movement, must be discerning. As I once heard someone say \\"Just because something claims to be Christian, doesn't mean it's kosher.\\" Today is seems like anything is acceptable as long as it is labled Christian.<br /><br />I have nothing against Charismatics as people. I know there are many who truly love the Lord. But we must be extreamly careful about who we allow to teach us.<br /><br />If anyone would like to read more about the problems with the Charismatic movement, I highly recommend John MacArthur's book \\"Charismatic Chaos\\" It deals many of these same issues.	2005-04-24

Let me tell you that in general principle, Coulter is almost always on the money with what she is saying.  She speaks with passion, conviction, humor and wit, about some of the more screwed up things going on in politics that are causes for grave concern, but are mostly ignored by everybody.  Unfortunately, she has two problems.  The first is she is not well spoken.  And by that I don't mean she isn't articulate.  What I mean is....she speaks like a girl.  Often, she goes on and on about something in vague emotional terms, only to go off on an irrelevent tangent or illustrate a point in a way that is ineffective.  The other problem she has is she tends to pull stuff out of her ass.  She'll say something that she doesn' really know, isn't readily verified, and is often wrong, trying to make a point or give weight to an argument.  It makes her look like an idiot and I wish she would stop it.  What she needs to do is learn how to speak from her friend Bill O'Reilly....stick to the facts but be passionate about the opinions you have because of those facts.  Be focussed.  Most of all...be RIGHT!  Say what you mean and mean what you say....and always check your sources.  It's not enough to be right....you need to prove it.  Also, the point of her book is well taken.  Often, you SHOULDN'T talk to liberals because they are dishonest in how they debate things (tough to win an argument any way else when you are dead wrong).  If you want to, the first thing you must do, before you even start to debate anything is FORCE them to be honest.  And the best way to do that is to display extreme examples of that yourself....mirror Bill O'Reilly and you will win every time.	2005-04-23

Eliot is probably known to every literate speaker of English over the age of 18 as the source for most of the material in the very long running Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, `Cats'. I believe the long dead Eliot even received a posthumous Tony award for his having done the lyrics for most of the songs in `Cats'.<br /><br />The book `...Practical Cats' is a part of a very distinguished tradition of animal fantasy works. The most famous contributors to this genre which come to my mind are Lewis Carroll, especially for `Jabberwocky' and the poem of the walrus and the carpenter, and Don Marquis, author of a series of stories collected as `archie and mehitibal', where archie is a cockroach and mehitibal is a rather disreputable cat who would be right at home sharing an alley with Mungojerrie and Rumpelteaser. These are all some of the more distinguished precursors to modern comic strips such as `Garfield', `Heathcliff', `Cats with Hands', `Marmaduke' and `Mutts', not to mention frequent guest appearances in `Ziggy' and that most famous of beagles, Snoopy.<br /><br />What is so amazing about this collection of poems is that it comes from the pen of the very proper and immensely precocious Professor Eliot. T. S. Eliot is best known for some of the most famously pessimistic poems of the 20th century, `The Hollow Men' and `The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'. By reputation, he is so prissy, he couldn't stand to be a part of our Babbitish American culture and beat a path to English residence and citizenship.<br /><br />One of my most cherished memories of T. S. Eliot is a story I heard first hand from the distinguished Johns Hopkins historian of ideas, George Boas who told the story of Eliot's staying with Boas in Baltimore and requesting an introduction to and visit with that most famous Baltimorean, H. L. Menchen. Boas had Menchen over after dinner and Menchen and Eliot sat down together in armchairs by the fire and Eliot said to Menchen `I understand you know something of American politics'. At this point, Menchen slipped into his best newspaper reporter barroom persona with stories of backroom dealings while Eliot slipped more and more firmly into his Oxford donnish persona. While I have no reason to doubt Boas memory, I was delighted to have the story verified in one of Menchen's many posthumously published autobiographical works.<br /><br />So what is this priggish don doing writing animal fantasy? I'm afraid I can't answer this. All I can say is that T. S. Eliot certainly deserved his Tony and a lot more for this little collection of poems. Eliot's little book contains fifteen (15) poems. Twelve (12) of these became songs in `Cats', although the `Cats' show stopper, `Memories' is not among these twelve. Also, the character who sings this song, Grizabella, is not the subject of any of the poems, although there are some similarities between Grizabella and Growltiger, the subject of one of the three poems not included.<br /><br />While I have no wish to diminish Eliot's accomplishment with these poems, he certainly knew a good thing when he realized that the animal fantasy genre offers great resources for inventing words and names to facilitate the crafting of great rhymes. Just think about the first verse of `Jabberwocky' and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />I cannot fail to mention the great Edward Gorey illustrations that come along with this edition. They make the truly tiny price for this little volume more than worth the money. For anyone on the lookout for intelligent things to read to your young'ens, you should add this to your copies of `Winnie the Pooh', `The Hobbit', the stories of Narnia, and `Alice in Wonderland'.Eliot said to Menchen `I understand you know something of American politics'. At this point, Menchen slipped into his best newspaper reporter barroom persona with stories of backroom dealings while Eliot slipped more and more firmly into his Oxford donnish persona. While I have no reason to doubt Boas memory, I was delighted to have the story verified in one of Menchen's many posthumously published autobiographical works. <br /> <br />So what is this priggish don doing writing animal fantasy?

Also, the character who sings this song, Grizabella, is not the subject of any of the poems, although there are some similarities between Grizabella and Growltiger, the subject of one of the three poems not included. <br /> <br />While I have no wish to diminish Eliot's accomplishment with these poems, he certainly knew a good thing when he realized that the animal fantasy genre offers great resources for inventing words and names to facilitate the crafting of great rhymes. Just think about the first verse of `Jabberwocky' and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br />I cannot fail to mention the great Edward Gorey illustrations that come along with this edition. They make the truly tiny price for this little volume more than worth the money. For anyone on the lookout for intelligent things to read to your young'ens, you should add this to your copies of `Winnie the Pooh', `The Hobbit', the stories of Narnia, and `Alice in Wonderland'. <br />	2005-04-20

US - $2923.4 billion <br />2. Germany - $1949.3 billion <br />3. China - $1283.8 billion <br />4. Japan - $1248 billion <br />5. France - $1118.1 billion <br />6. UK - $1101.6 billion <br /> <br />In addition, China's trade growth jumped 36% last year, compared to about 10% for the world as a whole (which figure includes China's). <br /> <br />I don't know how any competent journalist can claim, as Emmott does, that China is peanuts in international trade, ranking behind the Netherlands (as he says in this book).  The numbers show a very different picture.  If any country is peanuts, it is Britain. <br /> <br />Emmott's doubts that China's GDP growth is real must be put in the same perspective.  Indeed, in the light of such robust trade figures, verified bilaterally by other countries and finally by the WTO, it is difficult to see how China's real GDP growth can be as low as he seems to think. <br /> <br />	2005-04-19

This author projects his value system into people living in Jacobean England. He assumes his motives were shared by them. He's clearly a materialist writing about a spiritual subject and that is a major limitation of this book.<br /><br />On the positive side, he is to be commended for addressing the subject and digging into the archives to provide 21st century readers with a background of the Translators of the KJV of the Bible and the process involved. Factually, he's done his work. However, the negative cannot be ignored. his interpretations of people's motives is way off base. He assumes a lot that simply cannot be verified. The editorializing is offensive.<br /><br />He concentrates his efforts on sytle rather than content. Many pages are devoted to comparing the word choice of the Translators to the work of Shakespeare. The main point was to make the Word of God available to English speaking people on a wide scale basis. Reading this book you would not realize that. He infers it was some kind of plot by King James to unify his kingdom. Again, Nicolson is \\"reading\\" something into history based on his own imagination. Read this book critically. Do not accept the opinions in it.	2005-04-14

This love is verified by the almost immediate bestseller status upon release of each book. One family that has readers coming in droves to the bookstores is the O'Hurleys, those dancing triplets and their brother, mother and dad.<br /><br />This story features Abigail O'Hurley Rockwell, the quieter of the triplets. Abby married a millionaire/race car driver several years before and had seemed happy to those around her, which proved how talented of an actress she could be. Prior to his death, she wasn't seen in public often, yet her husband made the headlines with his numerous affairs, drunken brawls, etc. Everyone thought that Abby had everything - wealth, fame, etc - but that wasn't what Dylan Crosby discovered when he found Abby on her ranch working hard to just keep the roof over her head. Dylan had come to write a book about her late husband and was expecting to see a jet setter, which only added more mystery surrounding this famous couple and Rockwell's untimely death. Dylan was determined to uncover the truth.<br /><br />This plot outline doesn't sound like much, but has the special charm that only can be found with an O'Hurley and it makes this book a great one! Roberts doesn't disappoint us and has the rest of the O'Hurley clan make an appearance, which brings smiles to those reading. Who can resist Frank O'Hurley and his charisma or any of his children? If you haven't read any of the books about the O'Hurleys, you'll be hooked after you read this one!	2005-04-13

It was such an entertaining story I could not put it down.  The story of this property is truly horrifying and engrossing.  <br /> <br />I loved the inclusion of many pendulum sessions that Palmisano included for us to read verbatim, so that we could \\"hear\\" what the spirits were saying.  Foolish child that I was, having been obsessed with ouija boards, these were chilling to read, as though I had been communicating through the board myself.  They provided a lot of story in few words, which was nice since this book spans a six-year investigation.  As a story feature they are beneficial; as a research feature they initially turned me off.  I was reminded of reading Harry Price's \\"The Most Haunted House in England\\" from the 1930s, where he uses spirit dialogue as evidence.  I do not disbelieve that valid information can be obtained via pendulum, board, automatic writing etc. but I find it difficult to accept as solid evidence.  Interestingly, in this case the information was verified by research into the property, and it was information that the researchers had no way of knowing.  Hmmm.  Points for Palmisano and his team. <br /> <br />Also reminiscent of Price's writing and research style was the matter-of-factness of this book.  Both authors tell their stories in a similar fashion: \\"First we did this.  We got this reading.  How interesting.  Pose a question?  Then we concluded x.\\"  Palmisano's story flows a little better than Harry Price's Borley Rectory, and he does a much better job of incorporating EMF readings, temperature and weather conditions, who was present and sitting where, etc.  It is not very distracting to the story itself, but for those who like no factual distraction whatsoever, this may not be the book you're looking for. <br /> <br />Being Canadian myself I was excited to finally read a case study of a truly scary haunting from my native country.   <br /> <br />I was disappointed in the ending of the book, which simply drops off with the story seemingly solved but leaves the reader feeling as though the writer just lost interest.  Or maybe that was a deliberate tactic - to make us want more of the story!  So, Richard Palmisano...perhaps you could write a follow-up?	2005-04-11

If you want to merely read poetry or high-sounding, philosophical books without a desire to realize what those books contain, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />Never take anyone's word that something is true; investigate and research yourself to make that truth a part of your own experience - that is self-realization as it applies to even the most rudimentary knowledge. Belief that the world was flat did not make it so! That belief had to be investigated, and verified by proof that it was false and replaced by the truth that the world was actually spherical.<br /><br />What is needed is deep concentration on these immortal truths, along with deep, devoted practice of spiritual exericises that will gradually bring to light the foundation of Divine Truth upon which this work is based. Please, by all means, purchase other author's translations like Eknath Easwaran's, if you so wish, if you are unwilling to truly assimilate and digest the true objective and purpose of the Gita itself - awareness of God.<br /><br />Stones will always be thrown, especially at the truly humble in spirit, those devoted ones who strive to keep the torch of Truth alight amongst the thick marsh of darkness in this world's deluded minds. To those who do not understand and disagree with the work of SRF, they truly welcome your criticism; such negativity and opposition only reinforces their kindness and motivation to become better before the eyes of God alone, not man. But to those for whom it is meant will alone truly understand the Divine Message it was sent to impart to the world for ages to come.<br /><br />Those who not just READ Paramahansa Yogananda's books, but actually PRACTICE what He gives us in His books and Teachings will know, experience and love the One True Living God within themselves and within all Nature - He will no longer be a MYTH and someone or something just to be BELIEVED IN, He will be known, seen and felt, just as surely as we know we exist!<br /><br />I have read this book 3 or more times and with each perusal new and deeper realizations unfold and flower within my soul and mind. Each new reading is like I've gazed at its pages for the first time! So if you don't understand this book, read it anyways!

US	50702879	R3D5MMQU02UG58	0805069135	219495499	Why We Love: The Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love	Books	4	39	47	N	Y	A first approximation to a science of love	The one thing one can say with confidence before reading this book is that love is universal: it affects everyone on this planet and everyone that has ever lived. Love can occur spontaneously or it can be chosen, and it can be responsible for much pleasure, as well as much pain. It is so common that its celebration has become the topic of countless novels and platitudes, as well as embedded in a myriad of cliches. But can there be a science of love, i.e. can love be examined for example using the frameworks of cognitive neuroscience or neuropharmacology? Does love lend itself to the modus operandi of reductionism that is so characteristic of scientific research?<br /><br />This book can be considered to be a first approximation to a science of love. Targeted to what has been called the \\"popular audience\\" it nevertheless gives enough references that interested readers can consult for more details. It is an interesting book, and the author has done a fine job in presenting her case for a neuroscientific theory of love. It convinces the reader that such a theory is not only possible, but also does not diminish the importance and mystique of romantic love. If indeed in the future a comprehensive neuroscientific theory of romantic love were finally developed, this would not mean that such an in-depth understanding would alter our personal interest in engaging in romance. Love poems and love stories will still be written, jilted lovers will still feel pain, and people will still seek out and find the person of their dreams.<br /><br />That love is not an isolated process in the human brain is brought out with great clarity in the book. Indeed, love as a neuronal process or emotion is correlated with the emotions of jealousy, anger, and hatred, among others. And since romantic love is such a strong emotion, as are these others, one might be led to believe that it might, as a neuronal process, have a long lifetime. The author sheds some light on this question, quoting research from neuroscience that indicates that romantic love lasts anywhere from twelve to eighteen months. Noting this research, she nevertheless asserts that the actual lifetime of romantic love is highly variable, depending greatly on the individuals that are involved.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book was chapter 3, which is a discussion on the experimental techniques that were used by the author to study which parts of the brain are activated when a person is strongly in love, and a discussion of the brain chemistry of love. Her discussion summarizes some of her research that she conducted in 1996, with the goal of collecting data on the role of chemicals such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Dopamine in suitable levels can produce a more focused attention and highly motivated goal-directed behavior, all of these being characteristic of romantic love, the author asserts. As for norepinephrine, it can produce high energy, loss of appetite, insomnia, and extremely enhanced memory capabilities, which are again associated with romantic love. Serotonin, which has been used to treat individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder, is implicated by the author in explaining why people in love seem to think incessantly about the object of their love. The author though cautions the reader that her belief that these chemicals play a role in romantic love must be weighed against the fact that these chemicals can produce different effects depending on their dose. In addition, they perform different functions depending on the region of the brain, and each will interact with the other in different ways depending on the circumstances. The author though takes as a working hypothesis that romantic love is caused by elevated levels of dopamine or norepinephrine, and decreased levels of serotonin.<br /><br />The author reports that her experiments in fMRI scans indicate that there is activity in the part of the brain called the caudate nucleus when a person isstrongly in love. Subjects that were in love were presented a photo of their sweetheart and the scans indicated that the caudate is highly activated when this was done. This apparently was a surprise to the author, for she states that this region was widely known to be responsible for the directing of body movement, and only has recently been shown to be also responsible for sensations of pleasure and for motivation to gain rewards. According to the author, the data indicated that the more passionate the person was about their loved one, the more active the caudate was. As stated this statement is somewhat suspect, since one would need an independent criteria for determining the degree of passion in the subject at hand. In addition to the caudate, the scans revealed that the brain region that becomes active when people eat chocolate also becomes active when people are passionately in love. This result has been widely publicized in the press and Hollywood movies, interestingly.<br /><br />Another result, described as \\"striking\\" by the author, was that the fMRI experiments revealed activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain. The VTA has been revealed to be the center of the reward circuitry of the brain, and is responsible for the creation of dopamine-making cells, thus adding support to her working hypothesis. Because of the association with motivational centers of the brain, the author also claims that these experiments verified that romantic love is a fundamental human mating drive. Thus it can be hard to control, like other drives such as hunger or thirst. The author is careful to note that her experiments did not establish the role of norepinephrine and serotonin in romantic love. In addition, the role of the \\"thinking\\" part of the brain, namely the cerebral cortex, was not revealed in these experiments.a person is strongly in love.

My prayer life has been dry lately and I was looking for some Bible insight to reconnect with the Lord. Suffice to say this book had lots of inner-sight but little properly-interpreted Bible.  No sooner had I finished the book than I got out my NKJV, NASB, and NIV to check out the verses cited. I was truly amazed that a mega-church pastor, former theology prof & PhD published author could get his exegesis so wrong so consistently.  The book seems a rambling, repetitive excursus on one excerpted text sequence: 2Cor.3:14-4:6. I counted its use or allusion over 40 times in 220 pgs. It was used very superficially with no independently verified cross-checking by other scholars (none cited in the notes)as to its intended meaning. To say nothing of missing the crucial context of 2Cor.3-5 as Paul's complete discourse on the subject. To say nothing further of not addressing other crucial scriptures that entirely negate the whole plot.  I was faced with a choice. Either embrace this practitioner's extra-biblical belief system about primary point of contact/ main receptor with the spirit world being envisionary/ imaginative picturing-in-the-mind of what we want to be real. Or search Scripture itself for Holy Spirit-bestowed insights into prayer.   Jesus says, \\"When you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father Who is UNSEEN..\\" (Mt.6:6) Jesus does not teach us to envision-imagine-conjure up an icon of God to bolster our sagging prayer life or really encounter the Lord.  Jesus says, \\"Blessed are those who have NOT SEEN and yet have believed.\\" (Jn.20:29) Doubting Thomas-theology of 'seeing is believing' is rebuked here in favor of the blessed faith that biblically teaches the opposite:'believing despite not seeing'.  Peter says, \\"Though you have NOT SEEN Jesus, you love Him; even though you DO NOT SEE Him now, you believe in Him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy..\\" (1Pet.1:8) Peter does not lament the fact of Jesus' invisibility as a deterrent to true Christian experience. Nor does he advocate visualization-in-the-mind's-eye to compensate for lack of sight. Faith is the goal, not fixation on focused imagery to facilitate believing.  Paul says (conveniently omitted in this book): \\"So we fix our eyes NOT ON WHAT IS SEEN, but ON WHAT IS UNSEEN. For what is SEEN IS TEMPORARY, but what is UNSEEN IS ETERNAL...WE LIVE BY FAITH AND NOT BY SIGHT.\\" (2Cor.4:17,5:7)  This imaginative-praying practitioner preaches that Seeing is Believing; we become what we see. Virtual-reality in the mind is the missing dimension of true spirituality. Regression-projection erases and replaces bad past memories with inner healing.  The Bible says otherwise. I choose Jesus', Peter's, Paul's teachings on Scriptural Prayer over any substitute that impersonates things in our mind as objects of worship/prayer.  My story has a happy ending. This book went back to Goodwill. I got \\"Praying the Psalms\\" in exchange.	2005-04-08

And, for this special, long-awaited moment, does the once-august Boston Globe take the time to lovingly, painstakingly put together a keepsake for its maniacly devoted fans?  No.  Instead it puts out a complete and utter piece of dreck.  Someone at the Globe or publisher Triumph Books - perhaps the entire team charged with assembling this gaffe - ought to be fired.  Shame on you.<br /><br />This book simply was not edited, fact-checked, reviewed, verified or even given the simplest 'once over.' Even a quick read-through should have caused even the most junior editor at the Globe/Triumph to ask that the presses be stopped.<br /><br />Reviewer Arthur Weeks has compiled a great list and it gives you an idea of just how egregious these errors are - missing box scores, earned runs in shutouts, St. Louis scoring four runs in the ninth inning of a game they lost 6 - 2.  You can't make this stuff up.<br /><br />Here's a couple of more:<br /><br />- On pages 26 - 27, two pictures claim to show Larry Walker (p. 26) and Jeff Suppan (p. 27) making baserunning blunders.  In fact, both pictures are of Walker - different angles, but it's clearly Number 33 in both shots (and Suppan was wearing a warm-up jacket as I recall).<br /><br />- On page 86, they bollix up the name of the very guy who coined the term 'Curse of the Bambino': the Globe's own Dan Shaughnessy, who here becomes Dan Shaugnessy.<br /><br />Furthermore, the box scores are of the variety that appeared in your small, local paper circa 1969.  They've got about 25% of the content of a box score that appears today in USA Today and most other corners of the statistics-crazed world of baseball.  These box scores offer the reader next to no insight on the game.<br /><br />One other metric to give you an idea of how thin the gruel is: the marketing blurb provided on these pages (no doubt provided by Triumph) says the book is filled with 'hundreds of color photos.'  The book, in fact, has exactly 79 photos. And I'm being lenient here by including the front and back cover images and one page that contains six 1.75\\" x 3\\" photo head shots of various players.<br /><br />In short: pathetic.<br /><br />It's a crying shame.  I urge all Red Sox fans to avoid this book.<br /><br />I want my money back.enient here by including the front and back cover images and one page that contains six 1.75\\" x 3\\" photo head shots of various players.

How is an IT organization to spend its scarce resources to enable its business to excel in a world characterized by hyper-competition and co-opetition? Hugos defines the Real-time Enterprise and systematically explains its business foundations, supported by practical examples. Short overview sections on Information Theory, Cybernetics, General Systems Theory, Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, Business Process Management, System Dynamics and Viable Systems Model, to name a few, provide contextual settings in which the roots for the modern Real-time Enterprise are to be found. The book continues by explaining how to design a real-time enterprise. It does so by motivating the need for change and dynamic management, right through descriptions of real-time observation and action chains [the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop, borrowed from aerial warfare]and to guidance on where to start the journey toward the Real-time Enterprise once resolved as strategy. Directions of how to build an IT infrastructure for Real-time Enterprises, and tested project management methodologies are combined to serve as a Best Practice manual towards sure results. Decision-making, modern programming languages, social skills and people management, and the various steps of the system development life cycle, are all described in the context of creating the Real-time Enterprise. Of particular value is sections on hard lessons learned in successes and failures as the author experienced them in his career, and how these are of value in systematically moving towards the Real-time Enterprise. These lessons are classified in strategic guidelines for system design and tactical principles for running projects. Every chapter inthe book is supported by a vignette describing a particular executive insight related to the chapter content, and this is where the book's ultimate value lies; it is based on the professional experience of an author, also award-winning CIO, having changed the organization he works for to a Real-time Enterprise with sustainable growth and success in the world of today. Having read Building the Real-time Enterprise left me with fresh and profound insights on how to optimize executive effort and organizational resources for the creation of a dynamic and agile IT capacity in the modern organization. Free of clichs, this book has set a benchmark to be followed as an example of how to combine theoretical principles with practical lessons and verified successes in the IT world. It won't easily be replaced as company on my professional journey!	2005-03-31

They probably expected it to be as easy to set up and use as CVS; I know I did. While Subversion probably is as easy to use as CVS (and probably easier in many ways), it's definitely more difficult to set up and configure. Most of us developers without ready access to a sysadmin-geek likely stayed with CVS, shelving Subversion as an \\"I'll get to that later.\\" <br /> <br />Practical Subversion steps up to make \\"getting to Subversion\\" possible now. This book eliminates any excuse for forestalling the move to Subversion, whether you currently use CVS, Perforce, SourceSafe, or some other source control tool. This book is all you'll need to migrate to Subversion. Clearly written, it balances prose with actual commands and output, mixing in the occasional screen shot as appropriate. It packs information, and you'll probably want to read it with your fingers on a keyboard, so you can try out the things the book teaches as you read them. It's well edited, too, free from the spelling and grammatical mistakes that plague too many rushed-to-market tech books these days. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a book that gently introduces version control and Subversion to a wide audience, you'll be happier if you look elsewhere. This book seems squarely aimed at tech professionals, and expects competence and understanding of things like compiling, installing, adding entries to inetd, starting and stopping Apache, and finding installed libraries. To get to the meat, I guess, the author decided to skip the hors d'ouvres (to overextend a metaphor). I appreciated this approach, and suspect that most technical professionals will, to. \\"Lighter\\" books certainly have their place, but more serious techies appreciate more serious books. <br /> <br />My background: I've worked primarily as a software developer in my career. I am certainly no sysadmin, and found myself stretched in a few places while completing the tasks this book outlines. The penultimate paragraph in this review covers some of my struggles in using this book to get Subversion up and running. People more *nix-fluent probably won't have the same struggles, and maybe those who target Windows will be able to skip the entire issue by using pre-compiled binaries. I get a little nervous, though, anytime I install software on Linux without using apt-get, so I learned a little more on topics beyond just Subversion. YMMV. <br /> <br />As I worked through this book, I installed the Subversion server on a Pentium II 300 running Debian Woody, and installed the client on that same box, as well as on a Windows 2000 box and an iBook running Mac OS X 10.3.8. The server sits behind a hardware firewall, but I configured NAT to expose the server to the Internet, and I verified that I could access repositories from both inside and outside the firewall. I did not install any of the server pieces on a Windows server, but the book covers that as well.   <br /> <br />Chapter 1 introduces Subversion and walks the reader through installing and configuring it and the technologies it relies on. It provides a light dusting of what version control is, why Subversion came to be, and what problems it solves. That last discussion probably wouldn't convince the skeptical, if you were thinking to use this book to sell your organization on using source control, but again that's not this book's audience. <br /> <br />Chapter 2 plunges the reader into how to use Subversion from a developer's viewpoint. It explains how to create repositories, how to put files in them, how to work with those files, how to branch, how to create tags, how to merge, how to rename files, and all the other actions developers must do to properly use the tool. Each action is explained and demonstrated with commands. I was able to follow along in my own environment, and everything worked as listed. I'll thumb through this chapter heavily in the months to come, I'm sure. <br /> <br />Chapter 3 aims toward those who must support the operation of Subversion, explaining how to back up and restore the repository, how to lay it out on disk, how to configure hooks (triggers), and how to configure access over the network. The information presented proved sufficient for me to get both WebDAV and Subversion's own server/protocol (svnserve) working with little fuss. This chapter also covers setting up the various users, permissions, and passwords. Sysadmins will rely on this chapter in their day-to-day maintenance of Subversion. <br /> <br />Chapter 4 discusses how to migrate existing source code from other source control tools into Subversion. It specifically covers CVS and Perforce, and also explains Subversion's dump file format that you can use as a reference to write a tool to map your existing repository to a format that Subversion can import. It talks about  an intermediary tool, VCP, and a file format, RevML, that can possibly assist to migrate the code base. Finally, it outlines a manual strategy to migrate important revision history if no tool exists and you have no inkling to write one. <br /> <br />Chapter 5 digs deeper into setting up the Apache integration. Focusing on authentication, authorization, and encryption, it explains different ways to lock down your source code. It even explains how to generate a private key and a certificate, so that you can set up SSL on your Apache server. Again, all the commands work as explained, and by following the text I was able to configure my repository to be accessed through basic password authentication, over SSL, using WebDAV. <br /> <br />Most of the information in Chapter 6, Best Practices, applies to any source control tool. Seasoned source control users won't learn much here, except that you can beat your fellow developers who won't commit changes over the head with it. The Subversion-specific information on how to implement some of the best practices, however, is useful, and the inclusion of the chapter is a nice touch. <br /> <br />Chapter 7 explains how to integrate Subversion with various other tools, including Emacs, Ant, Interface Builder, Eclipse, Visual Studio .NET, and the web. It also informs the reader how to install command-line tab completion in both bash and zsh, which makes Subversion command-line usage so much easier. The Mac OS X discussion on how to get Subversion to work with Cocoa's nib \\"files\\" is worth the price of the book for Mac users. <br /> <br />I skimmed Chapter 8, which covers the Subversion APIs and how to develop programs that talk to Subversion repositories. I'll certainly get back to this chapter if I ever write Subversion-enabled programs, and the coverage seems both instructive and extensive. <br /> <br />Appendix A includes a Subversion command reference guide, which I'll likely refer to often, and Appendix B maps Subversion's commands to the commands of some other leading version control tools. <br /> <br />I did have some quibbles with this book, probably because of my lightness on sysadmin skills. I struggled to get Subversion to compile with Berkeley DB support, which is essential for the server piece. I followed the book's instructions to the letter, compiling and installing Berkeley DB 4.2 and passing the correct parameters to Subversion's configure script, but configure couldn't find Berkeley DB. Finally, I unearthed the need to put Berkeley DB's lib directory in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I realize that's in the Berkeley DB docs, but a mention in the book would have saved me quite a bit of time. I haven't gotten cvs2svn to work yet, since I don't have an adequate dbm module installed for Python, and have no clue how to procure nor install one. The book says nothing about that issue nor how to resolve it, and a stock Python install (I compiled and installed 2.4) simply won't work with cvs2svn. Finally, after I'd followed all the instructions to compile, install, andconfigure Apache and Subversion in the first chapter, I was dismayed to learn halfway through the book that I had to redo it all to get SSL support. It would have been nice to include the necessary SSL information in Chapter 1, so that readers can do the set up only once, even if it's just \\"do this to enable SSL, which is explained in Chapter 5.\\" I suspect a serious sysadmin wouldn't have tripped over these things, but they got me. <br /> <br />In all, however, this book has walked me through installing and configuring Subversion, and will remain within arm's reach as a continual Subversion reference. For techies who want more than version control and Subversion basics, this is your book.	2005-03-26

Davis and Rawls have spent many years attempting to inform the world of their discoveries. In fact, that was the purpose of their books in the first place.<br /><br />The scientific community can be quite slow and stubborn when it comes to adapting new revolutionary discoveries. Egos, financial interests and a belief that if it can't be found in established textbooks than it can't be true, are some of the biggest reasons why.<br /><br /> Nikola Tesla, the brilliant scientist who is the founding father of modern electrical technologies, among other world altering discoveries, had a difficult time trying to convince scientists of the true potential of his inventions. As the acceptance and understanding of his work grew in the scientific community, a growing number of its' members, some previous co-workers included, layed claim to several of Teslas' original discoveries.<br /><br />Many other scientists and inventors have had similar experiences, like Davis and Rawls. Just as Tesla's inventions have had a dramatic impact on the world, so too will those of Davis and Rawls. Their discoveries have already been in use for decades in several countries around the globe, but the enormous benefits of their proven and independently verified research are still largely unknown and unused.	2005-03-24

The approximate 6th grade reading level makes the language easy to understand. I can also recommend UCLFJ for players of very wide skill range because of the way it uses a \\"tiered\\" approach when covering the ideas behind every move in all 24 lessons (using games). It explains what a lower rated player (in the 800-1400 range) needs to know on a more basic level and provides the analysis and concepts that a sronger player like myself (rated 1400-2000) wants to see covered.  <br />The selection of games are excellent covering many very important concepts. These include a large number of very instructive games played by the author (I actually enjoyed some of these games the most) as well as games played by World Champions.  <br />The author has a deep understanding of the games used for the lessons in UCLFJ (providing for high quality and accurate analysis) but analysis and explains things that are in the student's mind (the author has the experience of having used these games in his actual lessons for many years and explains). The opening analysis contains important up to date analysis of some of the most important lines.  <br />If you take Bobby Fischer's games in UCLFJ and compare them side by side to Fischer's analysis in his \\"My Sixty Memorable Games\\" (an excellent book too!) you will not only find numerous improvements in Fischer's analysis (not seen published any where else) but the analysis in UCLFJ is much clearer and more to the point. Some major oversights by Fischer are pointed out in UCLFJ - and triple checking them (even on a computer) has verified this. However, the accuracy of the analysis in a book is just one reason to get it. <br />The lessons in UCLFJ are made more interesting by asking the reader to try and find the best moves throughout the games. I also liked the pointing out of genereal rules whenthen applied to a certain situation in the games and when there is an exception to a general rule and why! <br />Another great thing about this book is that it shows how to plan ahead. It sometimes will even break down the logic behind the planning by outlining it for you. Take Lesson Three for example (Titled: Planning Ahead, Snyder vs. Schmeleff) where a nice combination is used just out of the opening to set up a won end game! Wow! This game is fantastic. It also goes into detail on the steps used in the planning of how to win the Bishops of Opposite Color end game. The game actually contains an inovation in the opening to obtain a won endgame!  <br />Some of the games will show you how to take advantage of the type of mistakes that non-masters make. So you get a nice variety. <br />If you want to know how to attack, how to defend, how to use tactics, how to play openings correctly, how to plan ahead and want to great pointers on the end game then there isn't a better book than \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors\\". <br />	2005-03-24

It would be like if my country (sweden) tried to deny its invasion of norway, russia, and the majority northern europe. Or trying to deny the crusades made by christian knights to spread the christian faith using armed forces against those who did not convert.  <br />Face it, it did happen and i welcome any book that can help the truth thats why i give it 4/5. <br />	2005-03-21

The book on Twitchell was pure fiction and Steiger played the role of publicist.

It would seem that Steiger writes a book every-other month or so. Once again, this author has no creditability what-so-ever with me.

Its 315 small-format pages contain a collection of entertaining stories about \\"computer errors\\" and other IT-related glitches, drawn mostly from the general and IT press.<br /><br />Each story has been verified to some extent by the author although few sources are fully referenced.  Most stories are less than 300 words long, just long enough to get the gist.<br /><br />There are numerous examples of information security breaches in the book, especially if one accepts that most data-entry errors are either the result of untrained, incompetent or careless computer users, or inadequate data entry validation.  A typical example is the one about a Salomon Smith Barney trader who lent on the `instant sell' button on his keyboard one day and inadvertently placed on sale 14,500 French government bond contracts worth a staggering $1.3bn at a low price. Salomon managed to cancel the sell order but not until 10,000 contracts had been struck, leaving the company nursing a huge loss.  I'd have been willing to bet, before the event, that Salomon's risk assessments and contingency plans did not even consider this kind of event.  Do yours?<br /><br />Creative information security awareness managers, trainers and presenters use news stories like these to liven-up their training sessions, case studies, seminars, newsletters and intranet websites. Even people who hate IT enjoy the opportunity to laugh at the unfortunate victims of computer spoofs, stunts, accidents and failures. The trick is to use this kind of material to engage the audience and, while you have their attention, explain the underlying information security risk and control issues.<br /><br />At less than ten bucks, it's a genuine bargain.	2005-03-18

[[ASIN:0830815694 Jesus' Resurrection: Fact or Figment?: A Debate Between William Lane Craig and Gerd Ludemann]]This review is from: Jesus' Resurrection: Fact or Figment?: A Debate Between William Lane Craig and Gerd Ludemannn (Paperback)<br />The main Participants, in a debate about the validity of the Resurrection: Gerd Ludemannn (anti-resurrection) and William Lane Craig (pro-resurrection), with additional commentary by diverse others. Can anything be learned from the debate?<br /><br />More can be learned by any of a long list of books by unbiased, serious and well-qualified theologians. Personally, I do not consider Craig a theologian at the level Of Vermesh, Ehrman, Meier, Brown, Sanders, Fredrickson, Pagels, Crossan, or any number of others. To me he is more like a TV evangelist, who argues his from his beliefs/prejudices like a politician, where anything goes, not from unquestionable, academic evidence.<br />What we have is Craig who is trying to defend his faith, and Ludemann who is trying to find the truth. Neither can win in the end. There is no real unbiased evidence Jesus resurrection, yet faith does not depend on unbiased evidence. I have seen miracles performed, but those who were also present or who heard about them second hand pooh-poohed then miracles as \\"delusions.\\" Only those with weak faith feel compelled to out shout every challenger to that faith, because they are trying to convince themselves not the challenger who only stirs up their insecurities.<br /><br />Am I a Christian? Yes. Do I believe that God exists? Yes.<br />Do I believe that God can or could have Resurrected Jesus or anyone else had He wished to do that? Yes. Do I believe that Wm. Lane Craig has a legitimate, argument supported by several independent and unbiased pieces of written evidence, the minimal requirement for a graduate thesis, as required in such an academic debate, in this book and this \\"debate\\"? A resounding NO!<br /><br />In fact he cannot, no one can, because, at least at this point there is no such evidence available. The \\"evidence\\" he cites is not evidence at all, it is a collection of biased writings by biased men who were not witnesses to the event-if it did happen. Some of the writers of the New Testament may not even have been yet born before Jesus died.<br /> By-the-Way, if Jesus was born during Herod the Great's reign, and Herod died during or before 4 BC, and Jesus was at least 2 years old or less, Jesus would have died between 25-29 AD, not 33 AD, a difference of 4-8 years, and since we have heard from historical sources outside of the New Testament that John the Baptist died in 37 AD, after Jesus, and that Quirynius was not governor until Jesus was a teenager, thus could not have ordered a census in Bethlehem, 13 years before he was stationed in Jerusalem, and those are merely the least of the Testament's errors, they are not a most reliable source for such a claim.<br /><br />No, unbiased source has ever verified the Resurrection, only those with a strong `bias in favor of such an act of God. Does that mean that we may not believe that Jesus did rise from the dead? Of course, not, he may well have done so. However, that has nothing to do with this scholarly debate. The debate is about what evidence the debaters have and how convincing their arguments are and NOT about whether or not those events actually happened and NOT about what people should or should not believe.<br /><br />None of the above was ever established as fact by any source other than the four canonical Gospels, and the other canonical works. One of which was certainly doctored, all of which were edited, redacted and written, not by Apostles, but by people whose names we do not even know for certain, and written beginning with Mark, at least 37 years after the death of Jesus and ending with John 77-88 years after the death of Jesus.<br /><br />Having said that, this was neither the most thrilling nor best-argued debate. All of Craig's evidence is based on the four gospels and in an academic debate, the very materials which veracity are in question, are not considered evidential. Therefore, easily Craig has lost the debate.<br />Craig cites the following as established facts, which by rule of evidence they certainly are not.<br />1) Jesus was buried,<br />(2) Jesus' tomb was discovered empty,<br />(3) Some people report having seen Jesus after his death, and<br />(4) Jesus' followers preached the resurrection when they had every reason not to.<br />Ludemann is effective in shooting them down, not because they did not happen, but as in a court of law, because Craig cannot PROVE, that they DID happen!<br /><br />The debate is boring to anyone with a solid background in theology, it smacks of showbiz and is not a serious or meaningful thing and serves little purpose. It is more like watching CNBC than the BBC. Do I believe that Jesus was resurrected? I do, but that is a matter of faith, not tangible evidence.<br />I give it 2.25 Starsy materials which veracity are in question, are not considered evidential.

For the knowledgeable reader, it is also a cautionary tale of the distortion of social construct used by some modern psychiatrists. Fortunately, although hardly comprehensive, biomedical science is steadily revealing the fallacies of \\"historical\\" medical speculation.  <br /> <br />In the late 1800s doctors in \\"modern\\" hospitals sent post childbirth morbidity soaring to unprecedented heights. Why? The failure of physicians to wash their hands between autopsy and delivery room. The medical establishment of the day ignored the growing science of germs blaming rocketing death rates on bad mother's milk.  <br /> <br />Were medical historians to attempt to resurrect the \\"concepts\\" behind this historic medical nightmare now, the attempt would be ridiculed in biomedical circles and quite possibly the subject of intense litigation.  <br /> <br />The fashionable revival of the archaic concept of neurasthenia, declared clinically invalid and eliminated as a diagnostic category in the American Psychiatric Association's widely accepted Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV should also be viewed through the lens of biomedical progress. <br /> <br />The \\"political\\"reclassification attempts of biomedical disease including Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, formally and exclusively classified for decades as an organic neurological disorder (ICD10 G93.3), is an excellent example. Biomedical resarch tells us a great deal about the complex, but cohesive and distinct biomedical pattern of substantial autonomic dysfunction, objectively verified cognitive deficits, pathological post-exertional fatigue, CNS disordered sleep and endocrine function, and post viral immune dysfunction. Another biologically defined overlapping disorder, medically classified as a soft tissue disorder involving the muscles and pain, is fibromyalgia.  <br/> <br />Although the precise pathogenesis of biological, rarely pathogonomic, illness remains medically unclear in many organic disorders, including ME/CFS and fibromyalgia; seventy years of substantial, peer-reviewed biomedical research should be heeded and the scientifically and empirically unsubstantiated myths of previous centuries - left where they belong.  <br /> <br />As noted by British psychiatrist Eliot Slater, the resurrection of \\"hysteria\\" is a pseudo-diagnosis, which functions principally as 'a disguise for ignorance and a fertile source of clinical error'.	2005-03-16

Opening it on my way to the busstop my eyes flooded.  I loved Paul, that was indeed part of my emotion.  But I had just had a dream about Seneca, that he was an old man who had taken a protective position at my front door.  The preface of this book opens with a quote from the ancient. \\"The one who derives advantage from a crime is the one most likely to have committed it.\\"  I was grateful, a tremendous relief unlocking tears not only of grief, but terrible frustration. Someone was going to help us citizens who doubted the official line about what caused, and what did not cause, the plane to crash. <br /> <br />Having lived in Argentina at the beginning of the Dirty War, I was not able to grow up  trusting implicitly what \\"the government\\" says.  Having read my Argentine friends' names in the lists of the disappeared, I was not naive.  After over 30 years of having sickening hunches verified in fact, I knew that my sickness over the death of Paul and Sheila and the others was nothing to apologize for.  Still, it is a comfort to others and  essential for the truth to learn the facts.  Some time after the crash I became acquainted with articles written by Jim Fetzer.  He was methodically recording his own investigation into the crash and also into the government's investigation.  My gut feelings aligned with his findings.  I have communicated with him - to get a closer feel for his character - which like Paul's is strong, full of energy and humanity. <br /> <br />Like the above quote, many of Seneca's sayings seem so obvious one might wonder why anyone ever bothered to preserve them.  Contemporaries may not have had a method, or maturity, in their thinking that allowed clear perceptions regarding the human drama. This book has been and will be criticized, for one reason, because it is a preposterous idea to some that people would assassinate a US Senator, and not just people, but the peoplewho would derive advantage.  Those people.   <br /> <br />My sister at my wedding made a catastrophe of the wedding photos, putting bunny-ear fingers over the groom's head just before the shutter flashed.  The photos show that she was betraying my trust - the maid of honor trashing such a ceremony. It is amazing to me how my mother will not accept this fact even though she has seen and believes the photographs.  She simply cannot believe it.  There is no room in her mind for it. The facts slip through a membrane in her reality and disappear. <br /> <br />That will happen with this book - some will read and believe but then it will slip away and although it seems true, there is no room in their reality for it.  For others, like me, it will clothe the gut sensations in facts, bind us together, and if not bring forth justice will adjust the lines of history toward truth.	2005-03-16

It's a book I still love and have recommended to many.<br /><br />I noticed that one careless reviewer complained that it was only an outline. Well, it IS an outline. It's a very concise statement of some very extensive research. Concise or no, there's an awful lot there that can be immediately applied in improving your life and the lives of the people around you.<br /><br />Prior to 1971 I had read hundreds of books on both Western and Eastern religions and philosophies, and on various branches of psychology and psychoanalysis. There was lots of interesting stuff there; whether or not it was very helpful is another story (and much of it was downright destructive).  Fundamentals of Thought was immediately useful to me in clearing away the cobwebs and giving me information that not only made me happier, but made other people happier with ME. Much of it was simple stuff: I was finally able to have a rewarding relationship with a woman; I learned how to get along with my family; I lost my anxiety on the subject of death and decay; I became more honest; in general, I was making better decisions.<br /><br />Some reviewer complained that it was \\"unscientific.\\" I'm not sure what that means since the principles came out of an awful lot of empirical research, and since they can be verified as workable by anyone with half a brain who gives them a fair shot. If what was meant was that the writing doesn't remind you in the least of most of the writing that passes for \\"scientific,\\" I will gladly agree. Anyone can understand it and use it--no previous knowledge required. And it applies to ALL of life, not just to some tiny, specialized corner of it.	2005-03-16

I have to admit that I wasn't interested enough in it at the time to recall if he did it or even actually planned to do it.  I do, however, have a sense now of what it must feel like to make that kind of leap, because the authors of Why God Won't Go Away carried me over an impressive one!<br /><br />First let me defend myself from the religious readers who may suspect me of atheistic prejudices.  I believe in a spiritual being greater than the self--sorry Steven--but I also acknowledge that this is by personal preference and not by reason of scientific proof.  I even realize that for many people--like Steven--this just doesn't make sense.  That's okay.  I'm alright with that; it doesn't have to.<br /><br />With that said, I can go on to say what I enjoyed about the book:  Their look at the functioning of  neuro-biology, the theories of the origin of religion that they introduced, the fact that they tended to stay aloof from endorsing any specific religion, and their willingness to get off the usual track of studying speech, language and movement.  Certainly finding a biological and evolutionary basis for religious belief makes abundant sense.  It does appear that it has a strong inherent foundation, or it would not persist.  That it provides the population that possesses it with survival advantages seems reasonable.<br /><br />Now for the minor criticism:  Their discussion of how the \\"self\\" arises was interesting but rather simplistic.  Brain/mind studies is, I know, a relatively new field, but the authors did not discuss any of the other theories out there or how their own theory related to the research going on these days.  Although Damasio, Gazzaniga, Ramachandran and Pinker are all listed in the bibliography, not much is made of them and so much could have been.  The works of Blackmore, Dennett, Dawkins, Marcus, and Penrose  weren't even listed.  These are serious omissions. The authors were not studying the self; they were proposing how a self arises and how it might therefore perceive an internal event as god.  If they had made as intensive a study of the literature as they indicated in the first chapters of the book, they should have made more of the \\"experts\\" than they did<br /><br />Now for the most important issue.  In their final chapters and summation, the writers used faulty reasoning to make a case for a higher plane of existence more \\"real\\" than the material world.  I won't go so far as to say they tried to prove the existence of god, although the title might have implied it. This suggests a very basic misunderstanding of what science, let alone religion, is about--and this despite the fact that they themselves point out that difference.  They just ignore it.  Let's look at it.<br /><br />One may, as the authors did, study the effects of mediation and prayer on the human brain.  There have been enough studies that prove that they do have an effect; they're not all good studies, but they're there.  One may, as they also did, form theories as to how these electrochemical changes effect the perception of those who experience them.  One may even legitimately suggest how these electrochemical changes in human brain tissue may have led to the formation of and belief in various religions. It goes a long way toward explaining why, even today,  people are willing to murder \\"outsiders\\" based upon their religion alone<br /><br />To leap from these tenuous and rather preliminary scientific findings and the possibilities they suggest to a conclusion that these same tenuously proven  biological faculties \\"proves\\" a higher plane--let alone god--exists, is definitely not.  Just because someone's mind perceives an experience as \\"real\\" while in an altered state of consciousness does not constitue \\"proof.\\"  That doesn't mean they are dissimulating; it means that it is their own subjective response to an internal experience.  But does a person capable of this type of experience require proof to believe?<br /><br />Now for my pet peeve: The authors drag in poor Einstein and Schr&ouml;dinger, as so many others before them have, as \\"witnesses.\\" They imply that the great authors of Relativity and of Quantum physics respectively would have approved and agreed with their proposal.

Almost a decade of experience in living, sexually and otherwise, has taught me that there are indeed profound differences between men and women that cannot be accounted for by culture.  In particular, our sexual orientation seems as much hardwired as socially induced.  I do believe that media has a profound effect on sexual development.  Kids, and I do mean kids, are having sex at ten and doing know not only the slang terms but the meaning of the more erudite variants, like fellatio and cunnilingus.  Yet when it comes to sexual hunger, sexual proclivities, sexual orientation, it doesn't just seem that genetics plays a role, but is now being verified to be the case.  There is no \\"gay gene\\" as it turns out.  Rather there is a gene that is just not being expressed.  This gene, oddly enough, correlates well with handiness as well.  Those with the gene are right-handed and overwhelming straight.  Those who lack it have a 50-50 chance or being either lefties or righties.  The gene seems to direct sexual and handiness orientation.  The lack of the gene means there is no preference, so individuals have a spectrum, ranging from being straight, bisexual, and homosexual.  It would seem for those who lack the right-handed gene, culture then plays a strong role in formulating orientation, especially during adolescence, setting life-long tendencies.  Many continue to reject this, but the evidence is very more mounting and the gene, RGHT1, is currently trying to be sequenced by labs around the world.  Lastly, I find it odd that Paglia once said that if history were up to women, we'd all be still living in grass huts thinks that genetics doesn't play a role in sexuality.  Her comment about women surely underscores a biological underpinning of behavior.  If Paglia believes that men are more biologically inclined to invent, systemize, and create complex ideasand structures, why would she then not think that that biology would not extend its more influence to the most primal of all biological of realms: sexuality?  Strange and most \\"uncool\\" for being so anti-science.  I would highly recommend any of Steven Pinkers books, especiall the Blank Slate and How the Mind Works, which aside from the decidedly pompous-sounding title, does a great service in injecting real science and reasoning into the complex matters of human behavior.	2005-03-10

Ayer: A Life	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Portrait of a Logical Positivist	A.J.Ayer stood in the tradition of David Hume, Bertrand Russell and the early Wittgenstein. For all of these, metaphysical statements, because they could never be verified by sense observation, were, in a philosophical sense \\"meaningless\\".  Meaningful statements had to be precisely phrased and then verified by sense observation.<br /><br />When Ayer was still a classical scholar at Eton, his interest in philosophy was aroused by Bertrand Russell;  and his tutor at Christ Church, Gilbert Ryle, introduced him to Wittgenstein's work.  Ryle was the only Oxford academic to have taken an interest in Wittgenstein;  nor for that matter did Russell figure in the Oxford philosophy syllabus.  Oxonian philosophers almost all came to the subject through the classics, whereas the Cambridge men had a mathematical or scientific background, which was so much more congenial to a branch of philosophy which aimed to pursue the subject with scientific rigour.  Ayer's background was classical, too;  but he responded enthusiastically to  Wittgenstein (whom he still thought to be the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus:  when the Philosophical Investigations were published, Ayer, like Russell, would think that Wittgenstein had gone soft.)  He wanted to use the interval between his Finals and taking up a lectureship at Christ Church, to study under Wittgenstein.  But Ryle thought the Wittgenstein cult was bad for both of them, and persuaded him instead to go to Vienna and study under Moritz Schlick, one of the leaders of the Vienna Circle.  The Circle's philosophy, itself originally inspired by the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus, was becoming known under the name of Logical Positivism.<br /><br />It could be said that Ayer was already a Logical Positivist before he went to Vienna;  but certainly by the time he returned to Oxford, there was noone in England better informed about Logical Positivism than he.  Ayer was the first to lecture in Oxford on Russell, Wittgenstein and Rudolf Carnap (a member of the Vienna Circle).<br /><br />Isaiah Berlin persuaded Ayer to write a book on his theories, and the result was Language, Truth and Logic, published in 1936, when Ayer was only 26.  The book itself would become a standard text of 20th century British philosophy.  Ben Rogers writes:  \\"The position he defended had become canonical, which was strange considering that it was hard to find anyone who agreed with it. Logical Positivism, as represented by Language, Truth and Logic was probably the school that under-graduate philosophers knew best, but it was a school that, from the beginning, most were taught to refute.\\"  But the refutations, such as they were, eventually came not from metaphysicians who had attacked the book so much from the beginning, but from philosophers who, like Ayer himself, were concerned with the meaning of propositions;  and they included Ayer himself, who over the remainder of his life fine-tuned or modified several theories he had put forward as an impetuous and (Rogers maintains) as an angry young man - angry with the establishment at Oxford which, he felt, had at that time denied him the prizes and promotions that were his due, for reasons that had to do both with philosophical vested interests and with antisemitism.<br /><br />One shortcoming of Rogers' book is that the arguments of scarcely any of Ayer's critics, with the exception of his main rival, J.L.Austin, are given a proper airing;  and the criticisms that are stated of Language, Truth and Logic in the biography are largely those of Ayer himself in later life as he modified his original thesis.<br /><br />The part of Language, Truth and Logic that drew the severest criticism from outside was the position known as \\"emotivism\\", which declared that moral judgments (as well as aesthetic ones) are no more than the expression of a speaker's approval or disapproval.  Moral statements have to do with values, and values are not a proper subject of philosophy as such.  This position made some opponents agree with a Westminster housemaster who described Ayer as \\"the most wicked man in Oxford\\".  (Doubtlessly Ayer's reputation as a libertine was also seen as consequence of what he had written about morals.)<br /><br />And yet Ayer, like Bertrand Russell, did have strong moral feelings and felt that he had to live up to them.  Certainly these did not include conventional moral feelings about sexual behaviour;  but he actively supported a number of progressive social and political causes.  He even agreed in his retirement to become founder President of the Society for Applied Philosophy -an odd position for someone who had argued that philosophy had no role in advising people how to live.  He now described that earlier idea as \\"rather insular\\":  although philosophy cannot lay down moral codes, it can at least help people to clarify their moral choices.  And, as a human being, we ought to make choices - as long as we don't think that they are grounded in philosophy as such.  In this respect he spoke of commitment in much the same way as did the existentialists, for whose general philosophy, with its strong element of metaphysics, he of course had no sympathy.  Ayer knew well that there were things outside of philosophy which were wonderful but about which philosophy as such has nothing to say.<br /><br />The philosophical parts of Rogers' book are not always easy:  he takes quite a lot of philosophical knowledge for granted.  But even readers who do not have such knowledge will be fascinated by the image he gives us of this zestful man and of the society in which he moved.  With all the many reservations one can make of Ayer's character (and about which even his wives were fully aware and articulate), he was hugely admired and loved as a person by a great many people: women, colleagues, students, and others.  The author, who met him only once and for the most fleeting of moments, admits to liking and respecting him.  One can deduce this also from the fact that the people who detested him (and there were some) make only a marginal appearance in the book.This position made some opponents agree with a Westminster housemaster who described Ayer as \\"the most wicked man in Oxford\\".

Jennifer Stevens and Jeffrey Scott Shapiro's summary of the Kobe Bryant drama will most likely be immortalized since the case has been settled and all parties -- including Bryant, the victim and their lawyers are bound to silence. Stevens and Shapiro covered the case up until February of 2004, but very little happened afterwards, leaving the reader with all the pertinent information, including what happened the night of the alleged attack and the police interviews with Kobe. It's a fast turning read, but good luck trying to find a copy in an actual bookstore. Either they're all sold out or maybe there was a recall for a new edition or something. It's pretty hard to locate a copy now. I remember seeing them in Borders when the book first came out, but ended up borrowing a copy from a friend after I had a hard time relocating the book offline. This book reads easily, but almost all of the authors bombshells including the police interview and 3 other women Kobe had strange encounters with has been verified by other sources. It's a fun read and unfortunately it's all there is since no one else has written another book on the case. I'm glad there was at least one book out there that covers all the main points and stories. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in a broad overview of the case and an inside look at who the main players are.	2005-03-05

If you're sick of people who just post partisan attacks or commentaries withouth actually mentioning anything relating to the book (which is 80% of the reviews for this book) then read on.  <br /> <br />After reading several of Ted Rall's columns and seeing him on tv, there was not one thing that he said that I had agreed with. However, after reading this book, he is suprisingly rational on some issues including immigration and  <br /> <br />abortion.  Overall, this book was a lot more interesting and thought-provoking than most of the usual liberal tripe by people like Al Franken, David Corn, or David Brock.  THe main reason is because it actually talks about what Rall  <br /> <br />thinks should be done (regardless of how crazy some of the ideas are) and only spends 1 chapter complaining about Republicans and how they're evil, etc.  The usual best selling political book from liberals these days is all about Bush/ <br />Republicans and lying, etc.  Rall has finally figured out that people are sick of these attack books and might rather instead hear what liberals stand for.   <br /> <br />So here goes. Rall's writing is very easy to follow although his tone is a bit crude at times.  The only problem I had is that he doesn't use footnotes or sources in the text.  All the sources are listed by topic at the end leaving you to go  <br />hunting for the validity of any claims made in the book.  There are several chapters which are repeats of each other but I guess some people never get tired of the term \\"neo-fascists\\".  Just like any liberal book, completely unverified conspiracy theories are mentioned (Bush had his underage girlfriend  <br />get an abortion in 1971 when it was still illegal,  Bush officials invaded Afghanistan because of the oil and gas pipeline, Al Gore actually won Florida by 46,000 votes), so don't fret if you're a kool-aid drinker.  Overall, he does  <br />manage to stay pretty close to ideas and issues instead of personal attacks though.   <br /> <br />Some of the things which Rall has suggested that I agreed with included \\"Education cirriculum should be nationalized\\", \\"affirmative action is  <br />indistinguishable from quotas\\" and that affirmative action should be eliminated or based on class (not race),  \\"from a biological standpoint, abortion is the killing of an unborn baby\\" (we differ here in that I think this killing is not  <br />justifiable whereas Rall believes it is), \\"Americans seeking to cast votes should answer a few simple questions\\", and \\"The US should admit more legal and fewer illegal immigrants\\".  I agree totally with all these ideas.  What is suprising is that they are all in stark contrast to basic Democratic/liberal  <br />principles.   <br /> <br />Now there are plenty of things which Rall says that are completely crazy.  He of course wants major economic changes all moving us more towards socialism (\\"wealthy individuals and businesses should be taxed nearly to death\\").  Also he  <br />says Judges should decide punishments instead of mandatory sentencing laws (the whole reason of which was to take out the subjectivity of sentences between judges), we need to convince other countries that hate us not to hate us, the environment is the most important priority, and that Democrats need to be  <br />completely ruthless and shameless in fighting the Republicans.  This is one of the main themes  of the book on which I think Rall is completely wrong.  He says that Republicans win because they are underhanded and they fight so much harder and dishonestly than Democrats.  I believe that the reason people aren't voting for Democrats (and most of the ideas he suggests) is because the majority of the people in this country don't agree with them (esp the ones I mentioned above).   <br /> <br />If you're looking for something that is interesting and not the same \\"Bush lied, Bush sucks, Republicans are mean, evil, Nazi's\\" liberal book go read this book.  Regardless of whether you agree or disagree withRall at least he has the intelligence to put forth ideas and try to explain them and why they will work/win.	2005-03-05

This book is not that journey; it is a complete work of fiction. The Meeropol boys (the name given to them with their adoption by leftist activists) Robert and Michael, plus others in the family such as their offspring Ivy and Rachel, have all become prominent leftists, continuing their attacks on capitalism and the United States. The problem that Robert has in writing this book is that even the Soviet Union has seen the light and disappeared, but in so doing, it opened up its vaults and revealed their ugly contents. Those contents were also verified by the release of the Venona Project papers a few years ago, which proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the Rosenbergs were traitors to the United States. I would feel sorry for the Meeropols, except that they have decided to continue in the path of their parents, supporting extremist left-wing organizations, attacking their country at every turn, and otherwise proving that apples, especially bad ones, don't fall very far from the tree. It is unfortunate that they have decided to live a life of denial instead of reflection on what motivated their parents to support this nation's enemies. Perhaps they would have taken different journeys themselves. It is ironic that the Meeropol clan now writes books, engages in leftist workshops, and work for organizations that undermine the liberties that they take for granted, just like their parents did. One of the saddest sections deals with Meeropol's attacks on the prosecutors of his parents' crimes, in effect blaming them for his parents preference to go to the chair, leaving him an orphan, rather than reveal the names of their fellow collaborators. Their love for communism obviously greater than their love for their sons.  <br /> <br />The errors and omissions in this book are so numerous and outrageous that it would take a book twice the length of this one to detail them all. Suffice it to say that if you are looking for anything that resembles the truth regarding what despicable scum the Rosenberg traitors really were, you won't find it in here. But thankfully there are several books which are available now to expose this piece of fiction for what it is.  <br />	2005-03-05

In fact, this is the third time that I've found myself rereading it. You could do far worse than to make this your primary reference work on the subject.<br /><br /> The author divides spirit manifestations into the following categories: 1) Spirits of the dead (traditional visitations and hauntings- often involving family members), 2) Poltergeists (violent hauntings that are energized by the psyche of a living human), 3) Phantoms (long term apparitions that become psychic marionettes), 4) Animal spirits, 5) Nature spirits (never human entities- devas, fairies, elves), 6) Deiform spirits (archetypical, god-like beings), 7) Spirit residue (psychic energy or impressions impressed into the natural environment, 8) Spirit parasites (hostile entities, capable of possession, traditional demons, and 9) Spirit mimics (in-between beings of the spiritual no-man's land, tricksters and liars.) Most of these categories are addressed in their own descriptive chapter. Multiple case studies (personally verified by the author) illustrate each phenomenon.<br /><br /> The last chapter is especially useful since it deals with how to personally interact with spirits. The principles are useful and practical: 1) don't ignore your psychic encounters (pay attention- there is usually a reason for such contact), 2) don't take all spirit or psychic messages literally (there are levels of symbolism involved), 3) combine psychic impressions with common sense (some spirits are simply inept, and some are active liars, frauds, and tricksters), 4) and learn to develop your paranormal abilities (the more you practice the better it works.) There are also warnings, tips, and techniques on how to recognize and resist negative entities.<br /><br /> It once depressed me that so many people seemed to regard the existence of the \\"shadow world\\" next to our own as fantasy, superstition, or mental instability. Mr. Steiger's research over the past half century has been instrumental in changing that. In fact, this book cites polls that show that a majority of people accept the survival of the spirit after death- and existence of spirit contact across the veil. The author's daughter is quoted as saying that this is the real importance of such phenomena- they provide personal and reassuring proof of survival after physical death. Some would call that wishful thinking, but I think that it is more in-line with rediscovering eternal Truth.ition, or mental instability.

Woods and Ferrara present a fair and even handed critique of the abuses, novelties, and seemingly unwarranted changes to almost every aspect of Church life since Vatican II.  <br /> <br />The Strength of this book is that it is well footnoted, and everything it purports can be verified in fact by both Church and Secular News.  <br /> <br />Woods and Ferrera hit the nail on the head when they begin and center the attack on Post Vatican II reforms on Ecumenism. Just about every misinterpretation of Vatican II, and ambiguity in the council itself has its center in Ecumenism. The authors then continue a relentless and well thought out critique of Vatican positions and non-actions since the close of Vatican II, and help show how Neo-conservatives are doing more to undermine Catholicism by feeling as though the Pope must have the benefit of the doubt when he is doing things that are scandalous and tell other bishops their actions are okay because the Pope does them too. Like the interfaith gatherings at Assisi, the authors treat this very well. If in fact it was just a gathering to pray to God Himself for peace, why in the world did the Pagans there need to go to different places to worship? Its because they were worshiping their false gods, at the Pope's behest! If that's not scandalous, the word has taken on a new term.  <br /> <br />Ferrera and Woods also deliver a strong critique of the best Neo-Conservative books and arguments defending the Novus Ordo and the status quo concerning Vatican II.  <br /> <br />The only draw backs are that Ferrera and Woods attempt to defend the Society of Pius X by exposing contradictions within the Papal Curia on the subject of whether they are in schism or not. Sadly they miss in their critique that Vatican I declares that the Pope has SUPREME AND ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY in the Church, and he did in fact say in Ecclesia Dei Adflicta that there was a schism. The Pope isthe author of Canon Law, he can change it or modify it at need, because Vatican I gives him that authority. Every canonist, bishop and Cardinal in the world could disagree with the Pope, but that is irrelevant. If he says there is a schism there is a schism whether we like it or not, whether the Pope is a saint, wise, a scoundrel or a fool. That is the power of the keys.  <br /> <br />The other drawback to the book is that Woods and Ferrara coin a term that is somewhat misleading to define Neo-conservatives (mainstream Catholic conservatives who bear the butt of thier critique): Neo Catholic. The term itself suggest they are worshiping in a different Church, and believe a different set of doctrines than what Catholics have believed. This is not true with many of them, and in my opinion unfair. Perhaps however it is born out of frustration over the consistent demonization of Traditionalists by Neo-Conservatives.  <br /> <br />Apart from these two points, this book is accurate, and a well placed challenge that I am yet to see any one in the Neo-Conservative camp refute with anything other than the same rhetoric used in that self-contradicting book \\"The Pope, the Council, and the Mass\\" whose errors and self-contradictions are exposed by Woods and Ferrara.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most important thing is that the criticisms of John Paul II are all criticisms of his personal actions and opinions, not dissent from any doctrines that the Pope has authoritatively declared. The criticisms of the Pope are done out of a spirit of love, not mean spiritedness. Nowhere do the authoris attack the motives, intentions or the soul of John Paul II, and they stay the line of Catholicism and do not stray into Sedevacantism (the belief that all Pope's after Pius XII have apostasized and are really anti-Pope's, and the Church has had no reap Pope since 1958). No self respecting Catholic who loves his Church can afford to miss this.	2005-03-02

Anne Ayotte	This book has changed my life dramatically.  I was deceived by all the misinformation surrounding SHS even though I realized that things just did not add up, I had no proof. <br /> <br />Thanks to Dissecting Antismokers' Brains I now feel totally vindicated and the sense of guilt from this pleasure is pretty much erased.  The book is straight forward, thoughtful and well orgnaized.  It states all the facts which are easily verified and when you are finished you find yourself wanting more. <br /> <br />When non-smokers read this book they, rightfully so, are outraged to discover that they have been used as pawns in a power stuggle by an elite group of people who are making millions from this.  Factor in drug companies making millions from nicotine replacement products and most media outlets threatened with monetary loss if anything positive can be said about SHS and you have the biggest social lie of this generation. <br /> <br />What is happening right now in the free world is nothing short of criminal, akin to organized crime at it's best.  Antismoking groups have no real evidence against SHS, just half-truths and outright lies through manipulation.  This is racketeering on a world wide scale and most are unaware of this.  The newly approved smoking treaty which just came into effect now holds third world countries as hostages who must comply or else.  This is extortion and a violation of basic human rights! <br /> <br />We are all victims of these groups whose main goals are power and money but the biggest victims of all are our children.  While money, time, media hype and other resources have been wasted on the BIG LIE the use of drugs and alcohol has sky rocketed in young people, STD rates continue to soar and poverty continues to rise.  Antismoking groups are apathetic to these REAL problems while continuing to manufacture false data to reap in even more money.  These are taxpayers dollars being wasted while freedom of choice is being stripped away. <br /> <br/>Finally, for those of you wondering, I am independant of any tobacco companies or other interest groups in this area.  I have never met Michael nor have I even had a conversation with him.  This book stands on it's own merits, more than I can say for anything published by the antismokers.  Read it, you will be amazed and you will even get a few chuckles from his light humour injected throughout.  When you are finished send it to someone with some real political clout, someone who will ask the hard questions and expose these criminals for who they really are.	2005-03-02

It should be a 5 STAR RATING, at least.      The author, Simon Southerton is a former Mormon Bishop who lives and works as a biochemist in Australia.  His research in the field of DNA and genetics led him to the conclusion that, \\"The ancestors of Native Americans were Asians who unknowingly became the first Americans as they walked across Beringia,(the then land bridge between Alaska and Siberia), 14,000 years ago.\\"  These findings and research have been verified by numerous other scientists including some at the Mormon Church owned BYU, (Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah), comparing the DNA of hundreds of Asian and Native American tribes.    Two LDS biologists, Jeffrey Meldrum and Trent Stephens gave the most objective summary of New World DNA research to date, informing LDS readers that 99.6 percent of Native Americans appear to have descended from Asian ancestors.    This of course flies in the face of Mormon claims that Native Americans are descendents of a very small group of Jews who left Jerusalem 600 years BC and sailed by boat thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean to the Americas, and who in only 1000 years then multiplied and spread the entire length and breadth of North and South America.    According to the Mormon Church account these Israelite immigrants from Jerusalem wrote their history on golden plates which were subsequently translated in the early 1800's by their first prophet Joseph Smith into what has become known as the Book of Mormon.    Simon Southerton clarifies the often cloudy waters that lie between the Mormon religious claims on the origin of Native Americans and objective scientific findings.  He presents a solid case for the science-based perpective on the origins of American and Polynesian native peoples, while acknowledging the difficulties that such a perspective might cause for the Mormon Church.    I would highly recommend this book for any Mormon or non-Mormon who has an honest inquiring mind.  I would place my money on the objective scientific findings of fact contained in this book and it's conclusions using DNA analysis rather than the unsubstantiated religious claims of the LDS Church and the Book of Mormon.	2005-03-01

But read for yourself if you must. I do not recommend. How the Right get it Wrong and the Left Don't Get it is a much much better book tha both rights and lefts will love it and learn alot.

HOWEVER, a significant percentage of the recipes I have tried have errors or ambiguities that make the recipes difficult to execute. Specifically, the recipe instructions are frequently inconsistent with the ingredients list. It seems clear that not all of these recipes have been verified by independent cooks working from the book. An experienced cook can probably figure out how to make the recipes work, but an inexperienced cook will be frustrated when he/she runs up against one of these problems in the middle of preparation. <br /> <br />Another cautionary note is that many of the recipes are rather bland.

US	51173110	R3BKMWOENGE704	1579550088	20378952	A New Kind of Science	Books	5	153	205	N	N	An insider's perspective	Having spent much of the last three years thinking about the contents of this book and doing research in the program it establishes, I feel that it is finally time to set the record straight about what this book is and what it means.     First, what it does not say. It does not say the universe is a cellular automaton. It does not say we need to throw away existing science. It does not say that every other scientist is the world is an idiot. It does not claim every single minute idea contained within it is new, original, or revolutionary.     What it does say, however, is nevertheless as revolutionary as it is inevitable.   The fundamental basis for this book, and the science that it tries to build, is the idea that experimental methods are the only way to discover and understand the computational mechanisms that exist in our universe, and indeed to understand the nature of computation itself. Furthermore, it establishes a set of theoretically grounded principles about how these experiments should be conducted, and how their results connect to the rest of science.     Despite deeply confused claims to the contrary in some other reviews, this core idea is new. This is fairly easily verified -- just flip to Chapter 3 and ask, how many other scientists search through billions of register machines to discover interesting, complex behavior? Who else enumerates the 4096 s2k2 Turing machines and catalogues the computations they perform? This new kind of science is all about enumerating the *very simplest* computational systems and analyzing their behavior without biases towards any existing scientific tradition. This kind of research is simply not done in computer science, mathematics, physics, or the vague field of complexity theory.    Within the first 5 chapters, Wolfram establishes beyond a shadow of a doubt that complex behavior is ubiquitous in even the simplest of computational systems. Clearly, these systems do interesting things, and from a purely intellectual perspective deserve to be a pure field of study, much like pure mathematics. But so what? The rest of the book is dedicated to answering that question.    The fact that complexity is so easy to systematically generate suggests a radical approach to science in general. Traditionally, science looks for interesting things in the natural world, and then develops theories to explain certain aspects of their behavior. What Wolfram effectively is suggesting is that by exploring the computational universe, we can start by enumerating and understanding the theories themselves, and then going to the natural world and find places where they apply. At first this sounds crazy and counterintuitive, and from our traditional intuition we \\"know\\" that it cannot possibly work. But this book is all about challenging the traditional intuition using actual facts and ultimately fairly simple although abstract arguments.    Much of the criticism of the book - even by supposedly reputable scientists - is so laughably superficial that it barely warrants a response. But I will give one anyway. Critics complain that Wolfram does not give mathematical definitions of complexity, yet one of Wolfram's *main points* is that such definitions are impossible or at best useless. Critics complain that others - Fredkin and Zuse - first had the idea of the universe as a cellular automaton, yet Wolfram explicitly states that he does *not* think that the universe is a cellular automaton. Critics complain that computational methods are already commonplace, but ignore Wolfram's point that they should be leveraged in accordance to the computational realities of the universe. Critics complain that the book is unreadable, yet Wolfram over and over again captures in a single elegant picture what takes several pages of overcomplicated jargon in technical papers. Critics complain that Wolfram's ideas are too vague to be applicable, yet almost every other page contains an experiment that displays his methodology in action. Critics in the same breath say that the book gives no evidence for its claims while at the same time saying it is too big and sprawling. Critics complain that Wolfram has no respect for the ideas of others, yet they do not have enough respect for Wolfram's ideas to judge them on their merits, rather than the style in which they are presented. Critics say that everyone already knows about the power of simple programs. Oh really? Then why is science continuing to be done in ignorance of their consequences? Why is there already no field of empirically, systematically studying very simple computational systems? Because they are too boring? Not likely.     The book does have flaws. First, it doesn't make clear enough the distinction between studying simple programs for their own sake, and using simple programs in applications to the natural world. I also don't think the book makes enough of an effort to show that a science of simple programs is possible - for instance by developing detailed theories of some particular systems. The criticism of existing science is at times difficult to understand - in some instances Wolfram assails it for being computationally reductionist, and in others places he uses more practical issues such as the difficulty of numerical analysis. There is an absolutely ridiculous amount of information in the book, particularly in the notes -- I feel some of it is tangential, and it would have been better to study fewer topics in greater depth. While it didn't bother me, for the sake of others it may have been wise to tone down the use of the first person.    Looking at the trajectory of science, it is hard to imagine that the ideas and methods in this book will not grow to be commonplace. On some level, I feel that Wolfram's focus on experiment, exhaustiveness, abstraction, and simplicity just makes sense. The computational universe is like an ultimately idealized analog of the natural one - just as rich in its behavior, but far more amenable to systematic methods. Now that this resource has been identified, we should leverage its power.	2005-02-20

Once again I felt like I was in a classroom taking a very exciting course.  Brown would be a very good professor if he ever decided to offer a curriculum on some of these topics.  The main character in this story is Rachel Sexton who is a White House Intelligence Analyst working for the National Reconnaissance Office.  She is also the daughter of Senator Sexton, who is the leading candidate for the opposition party for the Presidency.  Sexton's main platform for his campaign is that NASA has a monopoly on space and that they greatly overspend their budget every year.  For the amount of money the public puts into this institution Sexton believes they should be getting a greater return.  He believes that maybe some of the private sectors could do better.  Even with these assaults on NASA by Sexton in the press however, current President Zach Herney has continued to be a great supporter of NASA even though it is ruining his chances for reelection.  When Rachel is called to the White House to meet with the President, she doesn't know whether she is being called on for her analytical skills, or if as her boss director William Pickering had warned, that since she wasn't getting along well with her father since her mother's death, that the President might try to use her as a pawn against her father.  When Rachel arrives however, to her surprise, the President seems like a nice guy and only wants her to verify the authenticity of a find NASA has made in the Milne Ice Shelf of the Arctic Circle, a discovery that if true could justify all of NASA's spending and ultimately guarantee Herney a second term in the White House.  She is then whisked away to the Arctic along with a group of independent scientists to verify the finding.  One of the independent scientists is an oceanographer named Michael Tolland who has his own television show like Jacques Cousteau, and he develops into Rachel's love interest over the course of the book.  One of the other scientists, Corky Marlinson a biologist, is used effectively for comic relief.  While Rachel is in the Artic she and the other scientists unravels some disturbing evidence about the find and have to try to escape with there lives while the truth is being covered up.  The biggest question is then trying to figure out who has enough influence to be behind all of these cover-ups.  The suspects then start to build up.  The head of NASA it appears must be in on it, and the President's main advisor, the cigarette smoking Marjorie Tench also appears very guilty, but does the corruption travel all the way to the Presidency itself?<br />In this story Brown seems to play both sides of the fence on the issue of NASA.versus the Private Space Industry.  I believe the truth lies somewhere in between however.  I believe NASA should stop working at a loss, and that some of these private companies should be given some of the contracts.  The monopoly of space (if there really is one) should be ended.  We just need to regulate these things properly to allow for the private sector to safely go into space while maintaining NASA's main goals which should be in science.  Our future lies out there.  How we get there however is still open for debate.<br /><br />This book was only written in 2001, but already some of the information about NASA having a monopoly on space is a little outdated.  Just this past year (2004) I witnessed a new space race in the private sector that caught my interest.  I loved the $10 Million X Prize challenge that was to be given to the first private entrepreneur who can put three people into suborbital space and do it again with the same equipment within two weeks -- and do it by the end of this year (2004).  The X Prize is modeled on the $25,000 Orteig Prize that Charles Lindbergh won for crossing the Atlantic nonstop in 1927.  Practically overnight following this, the narrow public perception of the airplane as a weapon and a stunt device expanded to embrace air travel as something for Everyman.  The X Prize serves to \\"to create a business model,\\" to show that the private sector can fly to space for only a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars that it costs for a NASA space shuttle mission, or even the estimated $20 million that space tourists Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttlesworth paid to ride on the Russian Soyuz.  At the moment, the leading X Prize contender is Burt Rutan's team (Team Rutan), but there are a half-dozen others close behind, especially the Canada-based Orva Space Corp., who are the developers of the \\"Da Vinci Project\\" (I'm sure the Dan Brown fans will find this ironic).  It features a giant, helium-filled balloon that will release a rocket 80,000 feet above Earth for a burn into suborbital space. Burt Rutan, who gained widespread renown in 1986 when his Voyager became the first aircraft to circumnavigate the globe without refueling, estimates that commercial suborbital flights could cost $30,000 to $50,000 \\"initially,\\" and as little as $7,000 to $12,000 in a \\"second generation.\\"  The \\"prize model\\" has also drawn interest from NASA, which is now trying to use similar competitions to enlist private know-how in overcoming hurdles posed by President Bush's proposal for exploring the moon and Mars. \\"We see prizes as a good way to do that,\\" said Brant Sponberg, program manager for Centennial Challenge, NASA's prize initiative. The agency has asked for a budget of $20 million for it in 2005. Sponberg is contemplating contests including \\"land ten kilos [23 pounds] on the moon very cheaply,\\" and \\"develop a system to land very precisely on the moon or Mars\\" without a satellite navigation system. \\"I'm sure there's some genius kid out there who can probably figure it out.\\" he said.<br />In Washington Senator John McCain who is the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, has also had several hearings on the commercialization of space, and members of Congress are examining current legislation dealing with the commercialization of space and proposing amendments to it.<br />Another big topic in this book is whether or not life originated on Earth?  The book makes reference to a real NASA discovery in 1996 named ALH84004.  This a rock that appears to be from Mars that was found in the Arctic and has the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  This could be considered evidence of bacteria fossils, and they are much smaller than any found on Earth, and if verified could be considered Proof that there was Life on Mars.  According to the Panspermia Theory (or Cosmic Ancestry), which is the belief that life originated elsewhere (possibly on Mars), bacteria or spores were used to populate the Earth with amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, which then evolved into all the species.  If this finding could be validated it would lend great support to this theory.  Since the rock was in the Artic for 13,000 years the find is currently being dismissed due to the question of contamination.  We won't know for certain if it is proof unless another rock like it is actually found on Mars.  The next NASA trips to Mars are not planned until 2007 to obtain a sample.<br />Brown also touches upon a few other advances in technology in this book that were very interesting.  He mentions Nano Technology, which are tiny robots that can make other robots or perform a programmed function, and Biomimics, that imitate nature.  By studying how to imitate nature, scientists created Velcro, and are currently working to mimic spider webs, solar power, and limb replacement similar to that used by salamanders.  Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) which are Microbots, are also described in this book are some of the up and coming technology that supposedly will be used more prevalently in the real world.<br /><br />By looking up some of the topics in this book I also found some very cool sites.

Books	5	29	48	N	Y	Accurate, Honest, and 100% Scriptural	Mr. Sundquist gives a very clear and Bible-based answer to Rick Warren's Purpose Driven false gospel. In Galatians 1:8-9 we are warned about ANYONE who preaches another gospel (false gospel) other than the gospel of Jesus Christ. Rick Warren twists and manipulates different bible versions to suit his own purpose in his PDL and PDC books. Using scripture that is as clear as black and white from an original, trusted Bible version, the King James Version, he exposes Warren's false teachings and answers them with God's Word. He spends time talking about \\"The Message\\" one of Warren's favorite paraphrases, and shows how it is a total rewrite of the Bible that actually changes the whole meaning of actual Bible verses, robbing God of what He originally said and intended readers to know. In addition to that, it is shown very clearly that \\"The Message\\" is written in, sometimes thinly veiled, New Age terms and phrases, such as adding Pantheistic terms and character to God which are totally false. Words like \\"centered\\" in Christ are added where the original Bible texts never had anything that indicates that meaning. Mr. Sundquist shows where \\"The Message\\" as well as most of the paraphrases that Rick Warren uses do NOT align with the original Greek and Hebrew of the Majority Texts, which can be verified at [...] The only version that clearly aligns with the Greek and Hebrew Majority Texts is the KJV. Makes one wonder who is writing all the modern \\"Bibles\\" and what their real intention is in changing and perverting God's Word. Mr. Sundquist exposes lie after lie and false teaching after false teaching from Warren's popular books and teachings, using the irrefutable KJV, backed up by the Greek and Hebrew renderings. If you care about whether you've been decieved or not in reading Warren's books, and you love God's Word and want to be enriched and educated, please get a copy of this book. You will be so glad you did, and God will bless you richly with understanding. Another excellent book that will prove Rick Warren's New Age intentions of The Purpose Driven Life is a book by Warren Smith titled \\"Deceived on Purpose.\\" Mr. Smith was deep in New Age teachings and practice before he gave His life to Jesus Christ and his eyes were opened to the false gospel of A Course In Miracles and the universal New Age movement. Both of these books expose Mr. Warren's books from different angles. Both are tremendous assets for any discerning Christian who wants to be sure they are not being deceived in this age of false teachers and ravening wolves.	2005-02-13

Since this will be the 25th, 5-star review I gave it a serious thought and summarized the public opinion for the book, what makes it a masterpiece as well as its author The World's N1 Expert on Cruise Ship Employment.  <br /> <br />I was jumping for 5 minutes after the successful phone interview was over and after I told my mom we were both jumping for another 2 minutes! Believe me, if this author with his masterpiece was able to help a McDonald's waitress to get a job as a waitress in a 5-star restaurant onboard of Celebrity Cruises then he really knows the ins and outs of getting a cruise ship job! I have also bought 2 other books from this category and believe me this one is levels beyond the others!  <br /> <br />If it doesn't help you to get a cruise line job then none of the other can ever help you out. When Tony, my boyfriend starts talking like this- first, second, third, forth, fifth I hate it! However when it comes to winning a cruise ship applications war for a single position the author's approach and style are both perfect and unmatched! He is giving you just like a road map which you only have to follow and... you are there just like me. I did it and so many people with verified identity by Amazon are writing in the reviews for the book that they have already got a cruise ship job.   <br /> <br />My mother told me: \\"Sweaty, it is better first to have 1-2 years in a 4-5-star restaurant before you apply for the cruise lines.\\" I gave it a thought and I didn't agree. Thousands of waiters with years of experience in internationally recognized hotels and restaurants are NOT getting a cruise ship job. What happened with me confirms the author's most zealous target \\"focus and impact\\".  <br /> <br />Celebrity Cruises want to stand out from the other cruise lines. That's why they need people who want and can stand out on paper and during the interview. Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days helped me to achieve exactly this and the words of the Restaurant Manager confirm it: \\"If you are worried about lacking experience in a fine dinning restaurant relax. In general we prefer to take people with little or no experience and train them how to serve the guests the way WE want instead of retraining already experienced people.\\" I think that the author's zealous focus on the employer's wishes and needs is generating all these success stories in the reviews.  <br /> <br />The author knows exactly what and how the hiring managers at the cruise lines want to see and hear to eagerly offer you a contract. That's why if you want to be the next hired buy it quickly before your competitors have learnt about it and used it to outperform you in the competition. I didn't allow anyone to grab MY ticket to exotic traveling around the world and tens of thousands of dollars per contract! What about you?	2005-02-12

It also portrays the effect that the murders had on everyone living in the area, including Rule herself, her family, and law enforcement officials.    The victims were very similar in many ways. In nearly all cases, they had dropped out of school, were abused either physically or emotionally at home, had abused drugs, and had run away from home many times before they finally left for good.  They were exploited and abused by pimps, called \\"boyfriends\\", and led a lifestyle of living in one cheap motel after another. They had to use many false names to avoid being picked up by the police, and were out on the street in all types of weather, trying to pick up \\"dates\\" for very little money.  In nearly all cases, the pimps got the money, while the girls worked very hard and were exposed to a great deal of danger at all times.      The book is well worth reading, especially for those in the helping fields, who want to know more about reaching out to those kids in trouble; it has some good insights. That being said, however, I did find a disturbing shortcoming which I have to address in this review, which I am re-editing after initially posting it on here a while ago. Ann Rule puts no footnotes, endnotes or other reference materials in her work, making it impossible to verify what she's saying, and I did find out on my own that there are some inconsistencies and misleading information in there that she did not bother to check. For example, newspaper articles are often wrong and she did not check to verify the accuracy of the newspaper articles from the SEATTLE TIMES on some of the victims' lives and deaths.    In short, read this book for the portrayal of the victims and try to make a difference in the lives of troubled youth in your own community, but don't take everything you read as complete fact, if it has not been verified.	2005-02-11

In the parts I've seen, Brousseau maintains that it doesn't matter whether a particular proposed truth happens to be right or wrong, only whether it sytimulates more thought. As Brousseau puts it, you don't think to reach truth, you have truths to provoke thought. Interjecting a stylistic criticism, his articulation is repeated somewhat too often (in one or another variation, e.g.: The reason we do philosophy is to think, and results only have value insofar as they impel still more thought.). But what Brousseau does quite well is engage his argument as a nifty response to current attacks on Postmodernism (he doesn't dispute them but delineates their consequences for philosophy thereby outlining a sort of \\"after French Nietzscheansim\\"). Brousseau does remind us that the notion of philosophy as wanting truth is dated (the profession's rewards are reserved for those whose ideas stimulate the most debate, not those whose ideas are verified). Most notably his proposition that there exists a kind of counter history of philosophy that has valued thought all along is legitimately intriguing. It's further worth noting that Brousseau somewhat dramatically achieves, if that word is permissible here, the end of truth insofar as endeavors to weaken it (Vattimo) or make it more interpretive are replaced by simple disregard for the truth of any truth. While this reader withholds judgment for the moment, it certainly will be interesting to see whether the ideas get the same amount of (perhaps too) devoted attention now that they are no longer quite so subterranean.  <br />	2005-02-09

Nakagawa Soen's \\"Inka\\" (authorization to teach) came from a single Japanese master of the Sozan Genkyo line. It was never independently verified. Consequently those who studied with this magnificent eccentric and themselves teach Zen tend to pass on his unusual views.

They've made a very good stab at that goal, but realistically, I'd have to say that those who are professional programmers in other languages will find this book too long for their needs.  For beginners (and even those moderately versed in other languages), this is an excellent book.  I really have only three minor gripes about it:      - First, throughout the C portion, the book uses scanf as the default for getting user input.  Unfortunately, as my compiler warned me constantly (and I verified on the web), scanf has been \\"deprecated\\" (I guess that's a fancy way to say don't use it, use something else).  Unfortunately, the book talks about alternative IO in only one chapter near the end of the C portion and very rarely uses it.  So, this book teaches as a standard an input method that's been superseded.      - Second, and related to the first, the book clumps all IO except for printf and scanf into a single chapter near the end.  It would have been a lot better if they had introduced alternative IO a little at a time throughout the book.  As it is, my eyes just glazed over when I hit that chapter.      - And, finally, though this might sound weird, there are too many exercises at the end of each chapter.  I read through this book on my own and so had no way of choosing which exercises to do.  Some of the chapters have over 40 programming exercises.  I suppose this is great at a college where the instructors can select different exercises for years without repeating.  But, as an individual, I'd have preferred a handful of in-depth exercises focusing on the chapter material instead of a huge number of varied exercises (some of which don't seem to have much bearing on the chapter).    One note about the content of this book:  most of it (over half) is dedicated to C.  It covers C in detail.  The remaining half is equally divided between C++ and Java.  The level of detail in those chapters (and the exercises, too) comes nowhere near that in the C portion.  If you're interested in C++ or Java, those chunks in this book are good, but you'll really need to read dedicated books to get the full treatment.    Overall, a very good book.  Experienced programmers might prefer something more terse, but all others will be pleased.  I give it 4 stars out of 5.	2005-02-03

Science, as Galileo, Kepler, and Newton taught us in the seventeenth century, is the discovery of mathematical laws obeyed by nature. Those laws can only be discovered and then verified or challenged via systematic, repeatable experiments and observations, and to be 'believable' by the scientific community at large those claims must be verified by competent skeptics. Mendel's discovery of simple laws of evolution obeyed by garden variety peas falls into this category. Mendel's scientific discovery was the first step in our understanding of cell biology.<br /><br />There can be no 'proof' (or 'disproof') of Darwinism at the macroscopic size scale. ''Macroscopic' here means phenomena with sizes on the order of centimeters or greater, roughly speaking. This was explained by the great physicist Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger (who discovered quantum mechanics in 1925 parallel to Heisenberg) in his pathfinding 1944 monograph \\"What is Life?\\". In that book, Schr&ouml;dinger reviewed all that was known about cell biology up through 1944, and then suggested the idea of the existence of a 'genetic script' in chromosomes (long linear molecules, roughly speaking). Schr&ouml;dinger's speculation motivated Crick and Watson to discover the helical molecular structure of DNA and thereby also discover the genetic code, the code that explains how evolution proceeds at the molecular scale mutation via mutation. We can never hope to understand quantitatively how a fish evolved into a bird, but we have daily evidence of 'Darwinian evolution' in cell biology, e.g., in the rapid mutations of viruses and bacteria to new and unforeseen forms that current antibiotics and vaccines cannot defeat. This is 'complexity' at work, and the essence of complexity is surprises. For a very readable description of the 5-6 mutations required for a cell to evolve into a matastacizing tumor, see Robert Weinberg's \\"One Renegade Cell: How Cancer  Begins\\". It is cell biology, the 'reductionist science' based on Mendel's physically careful oberservations of evolution at work in the mundane growth of peas, that formed the basis for all later scientific work that has led to the amazing scientific breakthroughs that permit cancer treatment.<br /><br />In a word. 'creation science' is not science in any sense of the word, but 'evolution' is science. A scientific model or theory must be falsifiable, meaning that it must be possible to prove it wrong, if it is wrong, via repeatable identical experiments or observations made by competent skeptics (a first requirement for a 'competent skeptic' is that she has adequate scientific training to carry out the required experiments or observations). Until 'creation science' can produce falsifiable claims, it is not science, it is mere ideology. Evolution, on the other hand is falsifiable: we see it at work daily in the effects of mutations.<br /><br />As for the notion of 'intelligent design', it is not needed. We understand from physics how the universe evolved into galaxies from the rapid expansion of a 'hot' gas of fundamental particles. We understand from physics how the solar system formed via condensation. We understand how life evolves via DNA. There is no need, at any point, to assume that God (if she exists, whatever 'God' might mean) intervenes at all. The notion of intervention by a god is not a falsifiable idea, is not science. One can legitimately and intelligently express lack of understanding about the details of how life evolved initially from the formation of complex molecules like RNA and DNA (scientists certainly do), but religious fundamentalism can only thrive in a society that is scientifically ignorant.<br /><br />What was there before the Big Bang? Where did the initial energy come from? Very interesting questions, but we don't know and can't find out. We don't even know if those questions make any sense. There is quite a lot that we don't understand, and with good reason. Science doesn't answer all questions, it only answers falsifiable claims. And hard questions can't simply be answered 'on demand' but require years of smart, dedicated effort, the hardest questions will not be answered in our lifetime or in many lifetimes. We do not yet understand the details of fluid turbulence very well, e.g, and turbulence is not a complex phenomenon. You can believe what you want about religion, but unless your claims can be tested then don't try to pass them off as 'science'. One thing is certain: where science may leave gaps in the description of complicated details of the evolution of the universe and life, religion or other ideology cannot provide us with any competent or reliable answers.can't simply be answered 'on demand' but require years of smart, dedicated effort, the hardest questions will not be answered in our lifetime or in many lifetimes.

US	47014068	R2XIGI4WT4AJNF	1565840399	418055365	Japan at War: An Oral History	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Fascinating, informative, nightmarish, essential reading	This book should be read by anyone with an interest in Japan, military history, or the extremes of human behavior.   <br />  <br />The book is structured chronologically, with each section introduced by an overview of the military and political situation.  The interviewees are introduced and described with tact and skill, and great effort is made to present the people objectively, allowing them to tell their own stories.  The interpretive comments are brief but very helpful.  The summaries of the military and political situations are skillfully done. <br /> <br />The credibility of the content of the narratives varies.  The Cooks provide enough background material to judge where many of the weaknesses in each narrative lie, but some of the more contentious episodes may never be objectively verified.  There is no reason to think they COULDN'T have happened, but that isn't the same as saying that they DID happen.  Much objective information has been lost or destroyed in the \\"fog of war\\" and post-war collective amnesia. <br /> <br />I suspect the Cooks just barely scratch the surface of the Japanese war experience with this book.  The Japanese historically have viewed defeat as shameful, and therefore not to be spoken of.  While Japan has changed greatly since 1945, I doubt that such basic Japanese attitudes have changed all that much.  The Cooks raise, but do not begin to answer, questions about the complicity of the Japanese military in atrocities, the concept of war \\"crimes\\", \\"victors' justice\\", etc.  No doubt the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March, the building of the Siam-Burma Railroad with prisoner labor were war crimes, as defined by the Geneva Conventions.  Were the firebombing of Tokyo or the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki therefore justifiable war tactics?  Would the path to victory envisioned by the American Naval Plan Orange, blockade and starvation of the Home Islands, for years, if necessary, have been a more acceptable alternative?  Of course these issues are beyond the scope of the book, but they lurk in the background for anyone reading it. <br /> <br />The Cooks do not directly address the issue of the culpability of Emperor Hirohito in the war and the manner in which the Japanese military prosecuted it.  Several of the interviewees comment on it in passing, but there doesn't seem to be a consistent view.   <br /> <br />\\"The Pacific War\\", as the Japanese call it when referring to the conflict with America and England, was a complete disaster for Japan, a total defeat of an intensely proud and patriotic nation.  The responsibility for the military defeat rests squarely with the Japanese High Command, their strategic blindness, arrogance and incompetence, their lack of insight into their own military weaknesses, and their complete underestimation of the military capacity and determination of the Americans.  The responsibility of other sections of Japanese society, the businessmen and financiers, the politicians, the average soldier, the Emperor himself, the fanatically indocrinated civilian population, is more difficult to parcel out.  All played a greater or lesser part, but the guilt and shame attached to any one participant's actions are for the most part difficult to judge.  The Japanese collective decision to keep silent and hope everyone forgets about it, while unrealistic, may be the best they can do under the circumstances.   <br /> <br />The confusion of the average Japanese participant comes through very clearly in these stories.  The Cooks put it very well:  \\"Japanese narratives of the Pacific War often descend precipitously from brief tales of victory and joy (or relief, or even anxiety) into a shapeless nightmare of plotless slaughter.\\" <br /> <br />Japan is now democratic and free, and has the fourth largest military establishment in the world.  No doubt Japanese forces will someday once again go to war.  The memory of The Pacific War, \\"The 15 Year War\\", if the war in China is included, how it was fought, the suffering inflicted on all civilian populations save the Americans, the devastating and complete defeat of Japanese forces and the destruction of the Japanese homeland, will no doubt influence how those forces are used in the future.  The  Cooks, particularly Haruko, deserve great credit for addressing this difficult subject, and for having the skill and resourcefulness to conduct these interviews, to save these memories for future generations to learn from.   <br />	2005-01-29

After seven other novels, this is a long-awaited sequel to those featuring detectives in a college town in North Carolina where a luxury resort is built to look like one back in the Twenties.  Does the South have a fixation on that time period -- here in Knoxville, after many months of commotion the major movie theater has been transformed back to the Twenties with all its garishness and frivolity but definitely old fashioned appearance.  An attempt at glamor by using four large chandeliers in the long, slanting lobby make it bright, but the addition of a well-stocked bar where a small concession stand had been previously, plus one downstairs where they modernized the ladies' room with mirrors and more lights, make it more like a brothel and nothing like it was meant to be.  They even removed the movie screen so that the stage could hold the full Symphony and Opera characters, took away its character completely.    At Hillston, the author claims, the South has not only forgotten the past, it has forgotten the whole idea of the past.  Not so, here -- as the entire downtown has gone overboard in making the place look old.  Everything is the past, as certain people with selective memories would have you believe.  There's nothing beautiful about the past in this town, only old crumbling storefronts good for nothing except being \\"the past.\\"  All the good memories of growing up here were dashed by omission -- what a shame.  The Twenties here were not exceptional, though there were a couple of vaudeville theaters (not reputable)  for the crude, rude men about town.      This is the South, though there is no gentility or upper crust per se.  Here if you make the Sunday paper society page, you have money and it doesn't matter how you came by it.  The women here are not beautiful (even when dressed to the hilt), the men simply self-important.    A lady in red appears along the horse trail near the luxury resort to cast a spell as she dives naked into the lake.  There was a killer in this town, though not the usual low-life type.  This one is educated and associated with the college.  He's verified by his prolific e-mail to one of the victims, over a 4th of July no one cared to celebrate.  He'd already killed his wife and parents (leaders of the town's social elite) among others.      His compulsive 272 e-mails were a Rosetta Stone of research for profiling the sociopathic personality and had attracted the coverage on CNN, MSNBC and Fox networks.  The city council took advantage of the media coverage as the prof had given the Southern college town a black eye.  The mayor and council wanted the fame and fortune anyway they could acquire it to promote the old-fashioned \\"peace in the valley.\\"    The first lady proclaimed the chielf of police deserved the medal for apprehending the criminal.  As they prepared for the Independence Day fireworks (nothing like the extravanganza this town throws), the police creed is that freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.    The lady in red had been a rock singer who made a profound effect on him.  Just human, he'd say, but as he spoke of his broken heart and shed some tears over his loss, as small town life tries to return to normal after this foray into criminal notoriety, he has some problem with fantasy wishes and down-to-earth reality.	2005-01-29

US	28307182	R21LYW0NPUWWXL	0865715408	218947445	Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil	Books	4	41	44	N	N	Law & Order: 9-11 Unit	One of New Society Publishers' latest offerings asks an odd question. What would happen if Dick Wolf adapted the September 11th terrorist attacks? The answer -- Law & Order: 9-11 Unit, AKA Crossing the Rubicon.  <br /> <br />In Rubicon former LAPD narcotics investigator Michael C Ruppert adopts the hybrid role of Sherlock Holmes and Winston Smith to investigate `the day that changed America', attempting to raise reasonable doubt in the reader regarding the official 9-11 narrative. Structured similar an episode of Law & Order, Rubicon adds to the original list of suspects (Osama and Al Qaeda), expanding it to include foreign intelligence agencies and elements of the US government, specifically naming Dick Cheney as a key suspect.  <br /> <br />Normally such a controversial thesis would seem absurd, but Ruppert steers well clear of overly speculative conspiracies and is very meticulous in his documentation. Past Rubicon's 594 page case, which features an assortment of maps, graphs and letters, is 3 document appendixes and 1,000 endnotes. Each of these endnotes, writes Ruppert, should be viewed as an exhibit in a court case.  <br /> <br />And some of the `exhibits' are jaw-dropping; including, but certainly not limited to, the documentation of how evidence in the Enron case was purchased out of the FBI's hands, the over 4.6trillion dollars that went \\"missing\\" from the US economy, or how the US military is planning to provoke terrorist attacks in the future.  <br /> <br />However not all of Ruppert's case is thought-provoking. His introduction lacks an inviting quality and his lengthy conclusion could have been split into two parts. Some chapters, like the two detailing a man named Delmart Vreeland and the main chapter on PROMIS software, might repel readers who can't verify the information as easily as they can the rest of the author`s claims. And though Rubicon features incredible documentation, there are a few lines which would be enhanced by an endnote or two.  <br/> <br />An excellent microcosm of Rubicon's strengths and weaknesses is chapter 12: The weaker arguments seem all the more flimsy when juxtaposed against other, incredibly strong elements.  <br /> <br />Other sections that proved strong despite their brevity were those concerning Wall Street, the global narcotics trade, the CIA, the official 9-11 commission (which Rubicon unquestionably rips to shreds and renders void) and, most importantly, the world's dwindling oil supply.  <br /> <br />For Canadians Ruppert's case could prove especially eye-opening as one of the important figures mentioned within, Ralph Eberhart, now holds a frightening amount of leverage over Canadian sovereignty.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, Ruppert makes an imperfect but very strong case. And after reading Rubicon, if you still disagree with the thesis, you'll have not only a more broad and complete view of the world around you, but also a treasure trove of additional information pertinent to everything from 9-11 and geopolitics to finance and geology.  <br /> <br />Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil is a must read. Highly recommended.  <br /> <br />Personal and overly anal observations:  <br /> <br />Every endnote I attempted to verify checked out, all were incredibly revealing and expanded a great deal on the info in the book, even the stuff that seemed completely insane.  <br /> <br />I would have preferred an endnote on the price of rice in Haiti (pg 24); the background on the Dulles brothers, especially the info about work with the Nazis (pg 53); the origin of Allen Dulles' quote on page 54. Though I'd already heard about it, some folks might have liked an endnote regarding Dyncorp and Lockheed Martin doing some accounting work for the Pentagon (pg 79). The mention of `numerous papers in Europe' should have been followed up with documentation (pg 229). I'd like to know where the author got his history and etymology of Judaism (pg 254/5). Though I'd already seen it, some might have trouble with the Secret Service occupying space in WTC 7, so an endnote would be handy (pg 433). I would have liked to have seen an endnote or direct quote of the press conference question asking about Clinton's involvement in drug running (pg 453). `I can't do everything myself' is a cop-out, especially for historical purposes and the info about Flight 93 should have been fleshed out a little or supplemented (pg 589).  <br /> <br />There's an error -- the only one I spotted -- on page 255. Chris Matthews does not and has not, as far as I know, worked for FOX news. Though the claim was mentioned second-hand, Ruppert should have verified it. <br />	2005-01-22

According to Palestinian educational television, Islam is a lie based upon lies. Of course they never actually say this, but if one extrapolates the absolute 'truths' they present, this is the only conclusion that can be drawn. Below are just some of their illogical or damning teachings (depending upon your point of view) that can be drawn from these latest diatribes. But first, some facts.    It is undisputed fact that Islam regards Jesus as a prophet.    It is undisputed fact that Jesus was Jewish.    Let's start with something very, very basic -- something even the two esteemed historians who presented the material, Dr. Jarir Al-Qidwa, Head of the PA Public Library and Arafat's Advisor on Education, and Dr. Issam Sissalem, Senior Historian and Educational TV host, former head of History Dept. of PA University, can understand.    (...)    \\"He (Jesus)and his followers used to worship in the temple which other Israelites used. The message of Jesus was to call people back to the religion of Abraham and Moses from which they had gone astray.\\"     and    \\"Based on the statements of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.), Muslims believe that Prophet Jesus will return to earth at a time when Muslims will be in a dire need of a leader.\\"    and    \\"The Holy Quran also gives a detailed account of the mission and lives of Jewish prophets like Moses and Zakarea (Zechariah).\\"    Meanwhile, both Dr. Al-Qidwa and Dr. Sissalem state that there is no such thing as Judaism nor that Jewish King Solomon's Temple existed:    Al-Qidwa: The Temple is the fruit of their (Jewish) imagination.     If what these two 'learned' individuals claim is true, then Islam, which claims Jesus (who was a Jew) as one of their main prophets and future saviors, is based upon a lie.     At the same time, the statements of Dr. Al-Qidwa and Dr. Sissalem fly in the face of facts proven by legal expert and erstwhile Judaism researcher, Dr. Nabil Hilmi, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Al-Zaqaziq. In the August 9, 2003 edition of the Egyptian weekly Al-Ahram Al-Arabi stated that he takes as fact the Bible's account of the Exodus: \\"...is based on what is written in the Torah. It can be found in Exodus, [Chapter] 35, verses 12 through 36...\\"     That Dr. Hilmi tried use these facts as the basis to sue every Jew on the planet for gazillions of dollars is immaterial. That he clearly stated in his interviews that he had verified the factual aspects of the Bible, even using the Egyptian police to do the detective work is significant. Dr. Hilmi has stated that the Hebrew Bible is fact, and that the Jews of today are absolutely the descendants of the Jews of yore. This alone flies in the face of what Drs. Al-Qidwa and Sissalem present:    Sissalem: \\"I want to point out that we should not focus much on what is called the [Biblical] Hebrew tribes, who are in fact Bedouin Arab tribes. There is no connection between them and these Khazar Jews [of Israel today]. Those [Hebrew - Arab] tribes were erased and ceased to exist and no traces were left of them...\\"     If nothing else, Dr. Sissalem has negated Dr. Hilmi's lawsuit against modern-day Jews by saying that we have no relationship to the Jews enslaved for hundreds of years by the Egyptians. It also implies, by extension, that if the Egyptians want to sue for return of goods ostensibly stolen from the ancient Egyptians, they should be suing the Bedouins. Unless of course, Drs. Sissalem and Al-Qidwa are wrong...    Further along, a very damning statement comes from the esteemed Dr. Sissalem:    \\"...the Bible expresses a tradition of legends, that has no connection to history.\\" (emphasis mine)    Notice how he didn't state 'little connection,' or even 'only partial connection.' Dr. Sissalem stated very clearly the word 'NO.' Yet if one reads the Koran, it clearly states that Abraham settled, by God's command, in the place of what wouldbecome the Ka'ba (22,27).    Since Dr. Sissalem stated that the Bible has \\"...NO CONNECTION TO HISTORY,\\" any mention of certain individuals and even groups from the Bible must be false. Therefore, since the Koran mentions Abraham, it must be a lie too. The same holds true for other individuals and groups mentioned in the false piece of literature, the Bible, as well as the Koran. Such people as Ishmael and Moses, and groups such as the ancient Egyptians. Therefore, the words of Mohammed, as written down in the Koran, are based upon a lie.    This aforementioned statement even negates the rest of these learned men's arguments that the 'Palestinians' are the descendants of the Canaanites and therefore entitled to take away Israel's land from the Jewish people and claim it for their own:    \\"...when our nation or our Canaanite forefathers came to Palestine.\\"     Since the Canaanites are extensively written about in the Hebrew bible, according to Dr. Sissalem, there is no such thing as Canaanites since the Bible has \\"...no connection to history.\\"     This means that the Palestinian claim of being the ancient Canaanites is a lie.     In essence, Drs. Al-Qidwa and Sissalem have not merely proven that the Koran is a lie, but that their very own contemporary scholars and statesmen are citing falsehoods when they quote the Koran, since it frequently mentions people and places which are mentioned in the Bible, and, as they will tell you, has no connection to history.     So instead of discrediting the Israel and the Jews, these two distinguished Arab experts have proven that Islam is a lie based upon lies. Bravo --	2005-01-21

Just last night I was tickled to find Sehnde on a MapQuest map, just a few miles west and north of the area some of my german ancestors are from!! The detail and careful connection to geographical reality just keeps you knowing where you are in space there while learning a detailed story about people from certain areas and towns, and more general history about social movements as a whole.  Two maps help orient you also, but the author apologized for them saying that's all the publishers would allow her.  You won't be disappointed in this Michener-type book if you want to know how old Germany developed from way back and \\"who\\" developed her!!  For instance, just now our main characters are trekking with their horses and retinues south over the Harz mountains to participate in Diet of Worms about the Inquisitional happenings during the early \\"reformation\\" of the church. We learn as we go thru specific towns who is on which side and how much!!  We learn where the dangerous areas were.  The detail would even tickle ardent neo-pagans!! Detail on the \\"old religion\\" before conversion at the point of the swords of Charlemagne's men and the henchmen of the Catholic church is fantastic!!  The book is just highly recommended for history and wonderful, mostly true, novel detail!!!  Alot of philosophical analysis is also bantered between the novel's characters.   Her grasp of history and philosophy is just exquisite, and probably quite unique to that area of historical development.  You won't be disappointed; even some great real-life scenes and concerns!

US	14894277	R25J2YKTUP96GL	047146502X	312680518	The Case for Israel	Books	5	30	61	N	N	Ignore the Critics	A couple of reviewers here would have you believe that author Norman Finklestein proved, during an interview on \\"DemocracyNow\\" that Dershowitz's book is plagiarized from Joan Peter's 'From Time Immemorial'.  They also claim that Finklestein has shown Dershowitz's book to be filled with factual errors and misleading information.  So in the spirit of open-mindedness, I read the entire transcript of the debate between Finklestein and Dershowitz.  In fact, what it showed is that Dershowitz was able to counter every claim made by Finklestein.  The so-called plagiarism was nothing more than Dershowitz and Finklestein quoting some of the same authors.  For example, they both quote Mark Twain on his observations while travelling through Palestine.  The Twain quote is authentic, and both author's credit Twain in their footnotes.  That is simply NOT plagiarism.  In fact, when asked by Dershowitz to define plagiarism, Finklestein was unable to answer.<br /><br />What, you may wonder, was Finklestein's strongest argument against Dershowitz?  In 'The Case for Israel', Dershowitz tries to show that a large number of Palestinians left their land in order to clear a path for the invasion of Israel.  He cites a source that puts this figure at 2000-3000.  Finklestein counters that the source in question actually put the figure at 200,000 - 300,000.  Therefore he concludes that Dershowitz has misrepresented the facts.  This accusation is nothing short of bizarre.  Remember that Dershowitz's point is that a large number of Palestinians left their land to facilitate Israel's destruction.  If he wanted to misrepresent the facts in order to bolster his theory, he would seek to inflate that number, not reduce it 100-fold.  As Dershowitz points out, this may have been a typographical error (omitting two zeros) or it may have been a reference to just one sub-phase of the migration (i.e. just one settlement or town).  If Finklestein is correct about the number, then he has actually added moresupport to Dershowitz's thesis.  The bottom line: Don't believe those who would have you to dismiss this book as a fraud.  Dershowitz has gone to great pains to have every fact in the book independently verified.	2005-01-16

McLean (Assistant Professor of Film Studies, University of Texas-Dallas) strives to answer the question \\"Who was Rita Hayworth?\\" Exploring the creation of this popular movie star's persona, beloved in movies such as \\"The Lady from Shanghai\\" (1948) and \\"Affair in Trinidad\\" (1952), Being Rita Hayworth takes an especial interest in her appeal to other women of the day who were struggling to navigate the demands of family and work outside the home. Careful research of Hayworth's life frames the chapters, which meticulously pick apart fabricated image and propaganda from what can be verified as truth. An excellent read for anyone with an especial interest in not only Hayworth's career, but the ripple effect her star persona had on the hearts and minds of a female generation.	2005-01-12

Anyway, I spent a whole evening enthusiastically (at the beginning) perusing it (the English version), but was left with more or less joy. <br />Many people in Amazon.com have praised this little book presumably without any reservation. I would also first congratulate the author's great effort to write a novel on scientific ethics, and in particular for the psychoanalysis of scientists. However, in terms of literature and science, I would say this book is not worth much attentions. <br />The plot in this novel is too simple. A serious professor had a brilliant idea (which is flawed based on biology, by the way), two worked experiments (probably), and the Nobel prize, but suffered by unverified experiments due to suspicious manipulations of his postdoc. It surprised me that he won the prize within a year. This oversimplified the reality. If the professor didn't publish his experiment details and furthermore the experiments couldn't be replicated in other labs (officially), it is impossible to get the Nobel prize, let alone within a year. It would be better that the professor didn't get the Nobel prize and was constantly suffered from unverified experiments, rumors of data fabrication, and science politics. The deft handling of these crisis is more interesting for future academic seekers.  <br />One of the key components in this book is about research ethics. We have heard many rumors about research ethics. This book talked about a similar situation occurred in the Noble Laurel David Baltimore's lab, in which a postdoc was involved some manipulations of data. I like the author's way of presentation: hinted but never gave a definite answer whether the postdoc did something wrong with the experiment or not.  <br />In terms of science ethics, I would like recommend people reviewing one of the most horrible studies in modern history: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. This study was initiated by the United States Public Health Service, together with the Tuskegee Institute in 1932. The study recruited 399 black men diagnosed with syphilis in Macon County, Alabama to determine the effects of untreated syphilis. The study would last until 1970, way after the discovery of penicillin in 1943, which is the most effective drug to treat syphilis. Unfortunately, these black men, with the highest education at 7th grade, were only treated by aspirin and an iron supplement. It was till mass media caught this horror that halted this experiments. By then, many had died of complications of syphilis.  <br />Although the book spent quite some length talking about trust, responsibility, authorship , lab rules, and in particular the peer pressure and jealousy, advisor seeking, tenure system, and gender discrimination, the author barely scratched the surface of publishing process, grant application and management, and other important research activities. It is possible that the author thought his intended readers are most likely undergraduates or beginning graduates. However, beginning graduates are eager to know how these research activities are like so that they can decide whether they want to seek academic jobs or not. Most time advisors are reluctant to talk about these issues with new graduate students. <br />The author also devoted some pages on sex, especially on teacher-student type of sex. I am not sure why he blended sex in this book but it did add some vintages in it. The depicting of female scholars in this novel is too optimistic. That a fresh female chemistry PhD can get an assistant professorship in Harvard, Cal tech, and Wisconsin is amazing, if not shocking.  <br />In terms of writing skills, the author seemed to have adopted a film making style. However, sometimes background events cut into flow of story too abruptly.Furthermore, the author lacked the ability to write juicy words when he was describing romantic events. His view of sex and romance was also old fashioned. <br />I think the ending is the worst part of this novel. As we all know, academic people are good at insinuating things. A famous professor will never write a blunt insulting letter to another professor. I guess the author tried to give solutions to all problems left in the novel instead of giving some hints. This reflects his lack of confidence to his readers, which are at least college students ( I doubt a not prepared high school student can understand many concepts discussed in his book). <br />In summary, if you don't know much about scientists, this book will give you a good kick start. If you are a graduate student who talk with your advisors very often, this book may be too simple to you. If you are a seasoned researcher, it is probably wiser to use your time on other amusements.	2005-01-12

David Rehak is a name to watch and though this book is my first exposure to his output, there is enough idea base here to merit exploration of his other novels and poetry.<br /><br />Placed in Abbeville, France in 1870, a time when the Prussian army is besieging France, this story begins with a young woman who is pregnant with her first child, alone because her husband is on the warfront, who is beaten and abused by the Prussian soldiers resulting in a slightly premature birth of her young son Alexandre.  As the child grows his parents realize he is crippled and surround him with love and caring.  In time another child Gustave is born and matures into a fully normal, handsome, athletic youth who easily captures the eye of the town beauty Marie-Anne.  From his wheelchair and bed Alexandre watches his altered life with sadness, then anger, and then rage against God for allowing him to be a cripple.  He becomes a recluse, only occasionally accompanying his mother to church to hear the words of the priest attempting to reconcile each individual's plight and sanctity of soul.<br /><br />Alexandre reaches his twenties and sees Gustave courting Mare-Anne, resorts to reading portions of the Bible that celebrate sensuality and other books that speak of sexual fulfillment until he finally resorts to visiting a brothel where he succeeds in finding satisfaction of his desires yet realizing sex without love is meaningless.  His brother loathes him, flaunts his physical acumen, and eventually announces his betrothal to Marie-Anne, the very person with whom Alexandre has also fallen in love! Tragedies occur, each one seeming to drive Alexandre further toward his nihilism, until he once again seeks the wisdom a priest and the purported comfort of the philosophy of religion.  Still fighting to understand his plight he has a powerful conversation with his mother over the his soul:  \\"Oh mother, how much longer do you plan on being drunk off the wine of self deception?  It's a cozy escape....You must realize that scientific positivism is the safest avenue of belief. All we know, all we ever hope to know about anything, is completely represented by observable phenomena and scientifically verified fact......Science does have its limits. I suppose you're right.  But so does religion.  I suppose the limits of science begin where religion begins, and the limits of religion begin where science begins...what if, perhaps, the truly profound answer lay outside of both science and religion?...I believe that God is an enigma whose existence can be proven no more than it can be disproven....mankind ...becomes disillusioned...He turns to art or literature, or friends, and the good things in life without which many of us would turn suicidal.\\"<br /><br />As the story winds down, the events that take place result in Alexandre's ultimate changes that prove to be the fine reason for writing this story.  One may quibble with the contemporary phraselogy and dialogue misplaced into the timeframe of the 1870s. One may find sections of this book to be a bit preachy, or of a religious zealot nature. One may long for more lingering on written descriptions of place, of characters, of atmospheres - all the things that grace fine writing.  But no one can deny that for an author this young, he has a fine talent for creating memorable people and stories.  I think his other skills will easily expand as he lengthens his stories into novels.  He is a refreshing talent.

It's a fun romp which mixes elements of McMahon's other widely acclaimed novels with the sexual daring and wit of someone like Vladimir Nabokov.  The hero is Ira Foxglove, a memorable name which signals the author's intention to write a not=quite=realistic book.  His wife has left him, and he's trying to re-establish a connection with his lovely young daughter.<br /><br />He's not much of a stylist, and some of the racier elements of the 70s seemed to have bored a hole in McMahon's libido.  As Foxglove watches a play rehearsal, he notices that: \\"All three were in faded blue jeans like Henley's, but through a split in one of the men's pants it was possible to verify that he wore no undershorts.\\"  And a few pages later, \\" Her arms were thin and languid in the long sleeves.  Certain kinetic effects verified that she wore no bra.\\"<br /><br />His ingenue snaps, \\"You big mother-grabbing bully.\\"<br /><br />\\"You said it,\\" Wolf came back.  \\"Grabbing you is like grabbing somebody's mother.\\"<br /><br />I don't remember \\"mother-grabbing\\" as a word with any currency, but maybe in the scientific community it had a sort of lingua franca that escaped laymen.  \\"Peaches lay still and breathed deeply.  She held the wrist of my anal hand in a tight grip.\\"  It's almost as though it was a translation from some other language--\\"my anal hand\\"--excuse me?<br /><br />That said, IRA FOXGLOVE is a romp through autumnal ardor by a respected author, and will please many.	2005-01-10

For one, it is the best written book about the Amityville circus that I have read to date (and I have polished off the books by Anson, Holzer, and two by Jones - with only two more to go) and, unlike the others, it is filled with easily verified facts.  Whenever Kaplan sites an article or a particular program, he gives detailed information wherein determined readers would be able to track down the material for themselves.  I have seldom seen this level of honesty in paranormal books before, where most articles seem to be referenced as being in \\"local papers\\" and with independently researchable data kept to a minimum.  I know that detractors like to insult Kaplan, but read the book - his detailed analysis of the escalating differences from the first press conference, to the magazine articles, then to the book (which changed from edition to edition as the 'credible sources' complained at the fictions author Jay Anson attempted to pass off as true events) and then the movie(s) is humorous and show just how easy it is to simply tell a willing audience what it wants to hear.  I doubt very much that an event such as the one in Amityville could be replicated today - though some have tried, because people are going to believe what they want to believe, regardless; and they want to believe in Amityville, demonic pigs, and bogeymen of sorts.  This book is still in print and available from its publisher, Toad Hall Inc, for an affordable price.  Highly recommended to both paranormal and Amityville fans (for whom it should be essential reading).	2005-01-09

Before you can make your way through the maze of teachers, students, courses, and cliques, you learn that the police have charged your 78-year-old immigrant grandfather with war crimes. Before you can make your way through the resulting maze of new emotions, questions, public scrutiny, and hearings, you learn that the government will deport your grandfather if it makes its case.  To make its case, the government need not present incontrovertible proof or even strong circumstantial evidence. Tenuous innuendo is sufficient, for all the government must do is establish a remote probability that your grandfather lied during the immigration process about his activities in his former homeland. This probability can never be verified one way or the other, for the government has destroyed all the records. <br /> <br />This is not another account of a Kafkaesque cold war regime or a cautionary tale about a twisted brave new world of the future. The powerful story that unfolds before teenager Kataryna (Kat) Baliuk's eyes in \\"Hope's War\\" is today's threatening reality for naturalized Canadian citizens who emigrated from Ukraine after World War II. (Naturalized U.S. citizens who emigrated from Ukraine live under a similar cloud.) <br /> <br />A talented art student, Kat faces challenges of her own as she begins the 10th grade at the Cawthra School for the Arts after a stormy ninth-grade year at St. Paul's Catholic School. Her new classmates, with their diverse loyalties and cliques, already know about the incident that forced her to leave St. Paul's. <br /> <br />Her grandfather Danylo has recently moved in with the Baliuk family after the death of his wife Nadiya (Hope). When Kat arrives home from her second day at Cawthra, she finds two RCMP officers from the department of immigration's war crimes unit interviewing Danylo about the forms he filled out 50 years ago. <br /> <br />Multiple story lines intertwine in \\"Hope's War:\\" Kat must discover who her true friends are as she tries to fit in at school; Danylo must force himself to revisit the horrific days of the German occupation when 2.5 million Ukrainians--600,000 of whom were Ukrainian Jews--were liquidated by the Nazi regime; the Baliuk family must pull together in the face of glaring headlines, protesters, hate mail and the impending deportation hearings to support a Danylo they may not know. <br /> <br />Early on, Kat sneaks into her parents' bedroom and finds the official notice from the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration: \\"Kat dropped the paper back on the bed as if it were dirty. What did this mean? That her beloved grandfather was a war criminal? The paper talked about atrocities committed and collaboration and thirty days to respond.\\" <br /> <br />Did Danylo collaborate with the Germans occupying his Ukrainian village in 1943 and 1944? And if not, why is the RCMP claiming that he did? Author Marsha Skrypuch is in no hurry to weave together loose ends and the answers to such questions. Instead, she allows the story time to unfold naturally with grace, passion and building tension before Kat and the reader learn the truth and for whom it matters.	2005-01-09

Gordon Smith is a well-known medium from England who has denied, questioned, tried to hide, and then developed his abilities to communicate with the spirits of the dead. Now he devotes his time to helping people who are in great distress of grief have consolation or directions from the Other Side. His powers and abilities have been tested in many different ways scientifically and he has been verified each time as being authentic and not a fraud. He cannot explain how or why he has this ability, but through the deep questions he has asked through the decades he has gleaned much valuable information which is comforting and enlightening and dispells the fears we have about the after world. The documented accounts in this book are fascinating and will give you pause to question your own fears and perhaps to look more deeply at your own denied abilities.  A very interesting read that helps us learn about our consciousness, to overcome fears and doubts, and to accept what once seemed beyond belief, knowing that it just might be everyday normal.	2005-01-08

The majority of this book is replete with contradictions, mistakes, and unsubstantiated speculation. There are so many gross errors and inconsistencies in the text that it is impossible to mention them all in this short review.<br /><br />  Neurogenic Shock<br /><br />  Dr. Mary Case, a board-certified neuropathologist and forensic pathologist with the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's Office and the St. Louis University School of Medicine, Dr. Michael Graham, a forensic pathologist with the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's Office and the St. Louis University School of Medicine, COL. Charles Van Way, a general surgeon with the U.S. Army 325th General Hospital, and Dr. Thomas Helling, the Director of Trauma Surgery at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, reviewed Chapter 2, \\"A Neurologist's View of `Stopping Power'\\". These well qualified scientists are unanimous in their condemnation of this material.<br /><br />  The absurd claims made in this chapter, as well as the similar remarks on pages 6, 7, and 176, regarding the ability of a bullet to remotely stress and shock the central nervous system (CNS) are grossly inaccurate and completely unsupported by any accepted scientific evidence according to Dr. Case. This pseudoscientific speculation is presented as verified scientific fact, yet allusion to G&ouml;ransson's discredited data is the only scientific reference the authors cite to support their unjustified claims.1 Dr. Helling remarks that this material: \\"...relates to anecdotal experience and pure hypothesis,\\" while Dr. Van Way states that it: \\"...would seem not only to be without supporting evidence, but to contradict common sense.\\"<br /><br />  A thorough review of the scientific literature relating to wound ballistics has failed to identify any valid research papers which demonstrate that projectiles can exert a remote effect on the CNS.<br /><br />  Street Results/One-Shot-Stop Percentages<br /><br />  Throughout the text, Marshall and Sanow offer \\"street results\\" which purport to show the \\"stopping power\\" and percentage of \\"one-shot stops\\" that particular handgun bullets have produced in actual shootings. On page 47 they write: \\"These street results are the heart and soul of this book on stopping power.\\" Accurate, documented field data of bullet performance in actual shootings is a crucial adjunct to laboratory test results; unfortunately, valid information is very difficult to acquire. Their \\"field data\\" appears to be based on anecdotal \\"war stories\\" which are incomplete and unverified, as illustrated by the example below.<br /><br />  On page 121, Marshall and Sanow state: \\"The following five Glaser shootings come from Gene Wolberg, Senior Criminologist, San Diego Police Crime Lab.\\" Mr. Wolberg, an author of this review, testified that only the third and fifth incidents described are fully documented and verifiable cases. Mr. Wolberg states he is only casually aware of the fourth incident and emphasizes that his second-hand information is undocumented. Mr. Wolberg denies all knowledge of the first two shooting reports Marshall and Sanow attribute to him.

They also ignore the crucial fact that many adversaries are incapacitated due to psychological rather than physiological reasons: they decide to stop, but are not forced to stop. While the degree and rapidity of any physiological incapacitation produced by a given bullet is predictable based on what anatomic structures the bullet disrupts and the severity of the tissue damage, psychological incapacitation is an extremely erratic, highly variable, and completely unpredictable individual human response which is independent of any inherent characteristics of the bullet. An eloquent critique analyzing the flaws of these \\"street results\\" and \\"one-shot stop\\" statistics is presented by Patrick.2<br /><br />  A typical example of the contradictions in this book is the following quotation from page 161, which indicates the authors are fully aware of the meaningless nature of these irrelevant and misleading \\"street results\\" and \\"one-shot stop\\" statistics:<br /><br />  \\"To make matters worse, all shooting results are anomalies, or single cases, unique to themselves.

Too many celebrity biographies, sadly, are little more than tabloids, reporting every bit of gossip as undisputed fact, even if there's zero evidence, repeating the same old unverified or exaggerated anecdotes, and giving credence to misinformation provided by questionable sources, many of whom have some sort of agenda.  Ms. Leider's book is nothing like the type of sleaze churned out by people such as Geoffrey Giuliano and the late Albert Goldman.  It's easy to fall into a trap of writing a sensationalised account when you're dealing with a star about whom there's been so much misinformation, gossip, and outright slander for so many decades, but she rises above that and reports only the truth (though of course people who have long cherished and believed in said gossip aren't going to be too happy their longtime fantasies are discredited).<br /><br />There were a couple of tidbits in this book I found to be a little too much information, but even those things were presented in a tasteful and respectful way, not just put in there to be to shocking or sensational.  There were also a lot of great pictures, and a LOT of sources listed in the back to go to for additional information (books, magazine articles, websites, etc.).  Having heard that this book was very positively and heartily endorsed at the annual memorial service on Valentino's Jarhzeit (death anniversary), I was sold on reading it.  And since this book has been written, happily, 'Beyond the Rocks' is no longer a lost film as it's reported in these pages.  It's the perfect combination of scholarly research, lively storytelling, and genuine respect and love for the biographer's subject.t.	2005-01-06

I am a Christian counselor, and I am disappointed with this book in how it evaluates Christian counseling.  This book is intended to be a textbook, but it is full of bias, bad logic, and wrong assumptions toward Christian counseling and Christian psychology. <br />  The author claims that Bible is sufficient to deal with every kind of emotional and psychological problem.  Therefore, psychology, especially those developed by the anti-Christian psychologists, should be expelled out of churches.  Psychology will only degenerate the power of the Holy Spirit in the realm of healing the emotional problems.  The author attacks Christian psychologists, saying that they made a compromise.  They replaced biblical wisdom with secular wisdom.  Yet I don't know any Christian counselor or psychologists who do not uphold Bible as their ultimate authority.  The author assumes that ALL Christian counselors think that secular psychology is superior in dealing with emotional problems.  This can't be further from the truth. <br />     The author also attacks secular psychology as money-making business.  It encourages people to pay money to get years of counseling only to be addicted to it.  This is a very obvious bias.  It is very clear that NOT ALL psychologists are business-oriented.  Many of them are sincere in trying to helping people.  Saying that they are all going after money is an INSULT. <br />     Also, the author assumes that psychology is not true science, therefore is psudo-science.  It is true that a lot of concepts of psychology cannot be verified by scientific method (How can you prove the existence of id, ego, and superego by science?), but it does not mean that every kind of counseling cannot be proved effective.  There are many researches that evaluate the outcomes of certain counseling techniques.  Some of them are ineffective, of course, but many of them do have positive outcomes.  The author ignores these researches and say that all counseling methods are ineffective and cannot be scientifically verified. <br />     Many of the counseling techniques used by Christian counselors, according to the author, are strange and unbiblical.  The author then gave several examples of such techniques that I don't know any Christian counselor would use.  I wouldn't use those techniques either, and I am a Christian counselor.  This is a bias. <br />     The author wants this book to be a textbook in counseling class.  I believe that it's not objective enough to be a textbook.  Sorry.  Only one star.	2005-01-05

I had studied the Napoleonic Wars for a long time before reading Unsworth's book and I thought that I had a good idea of the fighting conditions and the psychology of that period. \\"Losing Nelson\\" proved me wrong and opened widely in front of my eyes a wonderful history of a facinating personality. Unsworth uses his main hero, problematic Charles Cleasby, as a fanatical admirer of lord Nelson and builds a story where Cleasby's miserable and monotonous life is interwoven with that of the near mythical hero of the seas. Although Cleasby's psychological profile is revealed and explained in a masterful way, I regard Unsworth's presentation of Nelson's life and battles as the real gem of the book. Cape St Vincent, West Indies, Santa Cruz, the Nile, Copenhagen, Trafalgar and above all, the Naples controversial issue, are described in a terrific storm of literature. The words are carefully selected, the scenes are vividly described, the historical characters are painted in an unforgettable way. I couldn't stop reading the book and I devoured the pages until the strange finale of crime and catharsis. The book fired my interest to the Nelsonian period of naval battles and made me buy no more than five books on the subject, through which I verified Unsworth's excellent details. \\"Losing Nelson\\" is historical fiction in the most powerful form and I heartily recommend it to every history buff.	2005-01-03

Books	4	55	63	N	Y	Well written	This book reads much like Gone With the Wind and Jackie Kennedy's character, personality and upbringing is eerily similar to that of Scarlett O'Hara herself. Although the book is dated it is a fascinating and engrossing read.  Kelly's an excellent writer and story teller and aside from the speculation about the book's reliability, it is nonetheless, immensely readable. Moreover,  there is nothing in this book that is not consistent with facts which have been verified in the years since it was published.<br /><br />If you are a Kennedy worshiper you will not like this book. It is not flattering to Mrs. Onassis nor should it be. From all accounts Jackie Onassis was a self absorbed, materialistic and psyopathically arrogant bully of a woman.  You will not come out of this book liking her. But even under the harsh glare of the truth, Jackie Onasis is fascinating. She was a pivotal figure in this country's history regardless of her shallow, ruthless and self serving ways. You also might come out of this book profoundly resentful of the unconditional genuflecting she enjoyed from American society at large. How someone like this could move through life with absolutely no accountability and with unconditional reverence makes the book even more thought provoking.	2005-01-03

You helped us where we kept getting swept under the carpet by the 'specialists'.  ------------------  If your children or you have Sensory Integration Dysfunction or PDD, please read this book.  My son has both as well as digestive issues and after trying diet changes with no luck, I literally stumbled upon this book and gave it a whirl.    YES..it does work.  My son has regular bowel movements now, his tantrums have significantly decreased, his attention span is much better, his speech has blossomed and I could go on and on.  Ths information in this book is verified (as I did a lot of research researching the book and sources).      This is a natural remedy to try and it cannot hurt you in any way.  At the very least read it to understand about the leaky gut and how it affects development.    In the book she mentions her group on yahoo which I have been a part of after reading the book.  You can post messages there to get information about getting started, anything, anything, anything.  I cannot tell you how relieved we are to have found this book and try her suggestions.  We had been to a pediatric gastroenterologist who told us our son would grow out of it by the time he started school.    You have nothing to lose.  This book is well written, divided into logical chapters and you can start implementing the enzymes into your diet even before you finish reading the book (but I would recommend finishing the book).	2005-01-03

And there were some shocking suggestions that rubbed me the wrong way from my own previous research.  Some of the stuff is solid and sensible - but anyone who cared about their health and researched it and went to the health food store, and/or dealt with alternative health practitioners would know this stuff. I was ready to give it the benefit of the doubt(perhaps he had mended his ways and was trying to do something good by promoting 'freedom of information') and go do further research at his website. As a website professional myself, I was shocked and appalled to see such staggering membership fees for a site that hasn't even been completed, (as I would be for most any site, for that matter - who the heck pays (...) for lifetime access a website that might go down any day??)  And there are no example pages, no contact information - nothing viable about the site - why would you give them your money for nothing tangible??  And it just seems wrong that it costs anything, when the website URL is used repeatedly instead of giving information in the book.  Fine, it's not in the book because of freedom if information problems - fine, I have to get a membership to the site to see stuff - but I have to pay AGAIN? That's just wrong.  Give the info from the book, guy - get people signed up -- and then, if the info is good, they can get a subscription for a fair price. Of course, with there being NO contact info on the site, there is no way to give him some valuable feedback (or complain).    He also mentions the use of Dianetics - scary (not to put down Scientologists, to each their own, but it is NOT the first recommendation of dealing with emotional trauma and other issues to just latch on to a quickie cure - you have to find a psychotherapy that will work for YOU specifically) -  and he also mentions using the Gentle Wind Project tools(which is a load of tripe), also some other 'snakeoil' items - but saying the FTC has hidden these things -- whatever, they haven't hidden that kind of stuff - it's crap, pure and simple.  I mean, if you really want to spend lots of money for placebos, that's your deal, I guess. Personally, I don't like being misled.  He also goes on about 'organic' foods, when research shows that organic doesn't always mean 100% organic - and that 'organic' can be used as a 'lie' as well. He also does not mention garlic, onions or roots - which are well known as 'natural cures'.   You would think with all this information, he wouldn't miss some of this simple stuff.  Many of us who are interested in health and do our research could write much better books on our opinions of what would be good solutions to achieve balance and health in our lives. In fact, we could all put up a forum, add our own cures that have worked and have much better information than what is in this book. If you want a book about the government stopping free flow of information when it comes to alternative therapies, this book might be your thing.  However, it seems very convenient when he is not allowed to sell anything other than information (which is non-returnable, by the way), that he says he gives money to lawsuits and charities, etc. etc. - blah blah blah - it sounds like he is making himself look like he's a good-guy as best he can.  He is giving money to lawsuits against the government agencies - ie. his own lawsuits. This guy is no better than a criminal - can he not stop himself?  Perhaps he is just addicted to scamming people with whatever he can come up with.      So that sad thing is that with his horrible reputation as a scammer, and the fact that there are a few empty and/or scam solutions in his book might take away from the fact that there is a lot of good information in the book - though all of which you can find on the net or at your local library for free(plus more in-depth, verified, testimonial laden, photos, expert supported info with how to information!).  So, I guess, if you need somewhere to start researching, you could get the book and go from there, even though there are other much better books on the subject out there.  But don't be paying for his overpriced website - there is NO information that costs that much - you can go get the information for (...) (or less) from a session with your local Chinese medicine practitioner or a homeopath/naturopath, etc.    I'm glad I didn't actually buy the book, but I feel sorry for my Mom who bought the books (1 plus an extra one as a gift for me) and got talked into CDs she didn't want to the tune of (...).

I just wanted to urge those of you who are interested in this book, but are turned off by such negative reviews, to use the \\"search inside\\" feature and see for yourself. <br /> <br />For example: <br />1) The advice is much more deep and varied than \\"6-8 inches, perhaps more.\\" Look at the section for acoustic guitar, for instance. There are miking positions described all over the guitar, even under it and behind it. <br />2) There is plenty of information to suggest why to use one position over another. In the previous example, the book describes the effect every position has on the quality of the sound, noise pickup, and sometimes even the effect on the performer.  <br />3) It's true there's no examples of records that use particular approaches (how is the author supposed to know this, anyway?), but nothingreally must have missed the CD that comes supplied with the book which demonstrates every single example position described in the book. Not only do you get examples of the sounds, but this emphasizes point number 2 by letting you decide which position would work for you. <br />4) The examples given are not presented as the only options, and the book constantly urges the reader to experiment and try variations. Guidance for variations is presented not only along with the instruments, but also in the form of basics and fundamental guideline chapters. <br />5) There is more than one paragraph for the bass. In fact, about a page for the acoustic (upright) bass, and a litle over a page including a diagram for the electric bass (ie, miking the amp plus DI). One can also go to the electric guitar section for more amp miking advice. <br />6) And guess what, the hammered dulcimer section does *not* suggest to put the mic 6-8 inches in front of it. Go see for yourself. <br /> <br />This was all easily verified by actually looking at the book for a few minutes. I urge every other interested amazon customer to do the same, and to all but ignore nothingreally's misleading review.	2004-12-28

The book is well researched (although there are errors present) and despite not having spoken with the band directly, it does contain various interviews of people close to the band (and some of them fairly involved with the band, like John Marshall who was a roadie and filled in for James on guitar after several accidents).  So it does go into a lot more depth than say a book created solely from magazine interviews would (Chris Crocker, Im talking to you). The errors do creep in here and there, but a number of them are quotes from individuals and therefore not really the authors fault (such as Flemming Rasmussens admission that the band was embarrassed that fans would find Trapped Under Ice to poppy, when I think its clear that he meant to say Escape), although perhaps McIver should have clarified these a bit more in the teaxt. Some other mistakes are inexcusable (such that Cliffs tattoo was for Samhain, when actually its the Misfits Crimson Ghost logo  something easily verified), but considering how much is correct, Im not going to nit-pick. Up to the point of the Black album (and including the section on the Napster debacle towards the end  the authors opinion with which I am in total agreement with), this book is a really decent and engrossing read.<br />What I do find a bit odd is some of the books structure. In the early part of the book, there are tons of interviews of other bands that were on the scene at the same time as Metallica was starting out. While I do feel its important to give context of the bands place in history and a sense of what it was like in music at that time, these sections are too long and dont really add nearly as much insight as would be expected. Also, the authors obsessive need to define and categorize different styles of metal is distracting. I guess (in a misguided way), its his attempt to shed light on how older/earlier fans would be horrified by the growth that Metallica has displayed over their career because they no longer fit into the category of what they once were. Who cares? Its this childish need to fit a square peg into a round hole that really makes the latter half of the book come across like adolescent whining. True, Load/Reload and St. Anger are not great albums, but the authors reasoning for this is like a petulant child thats had his favourite toys taken away from him. Save the subjective opinions for the internet  and keep them out the book.<br />And this is also why the latter part of the book fails. Discussing Metallica in the context of heavy metal works for the early part of their career, but after the Black album, Metallica have become sui generis and really need to be looked at in larger terms. Their contemporaries are no longer Anthrax and Slayer etc., but U2 and REM etc.  bands with long, successful careers that have also changed shape and form since their inception, and in the process have also alienated fans of their earlier work. Its this refusal to accept Metallica in larger terms and deal with it in the book that, to me, narrows the target audience of this book to only fans of the band and of little interest to anyone outside of that circle. Metallica have had a major impact to music and the industry (not just metal), and not addressing this is a major failing of the book.	2004-12-28

Lewis is riddled with groundless guesswork in place of innovative research or thoughtful interpretation. In describing Lewis's early life,for example, he refers to Lewis's \\"overactive imagination,\\" and comments that Lewis listened to \\"pointless, meaningless\\" sermons when he was taken to church as a boy. On what, exactly, does he base such conclusions?  These are the sorts of unverified, opinionated comments that even a freshman English student would be expected to avoid in his research, and they are peppered throughout the book. Further, the prose itself is colorless.  One wonders at the sheer lack of vocabulary.  The book offers nothing that might flesh out the intellectual context of Lewis's best known works. This biography is a waste of time.	2004-12-28

This is not the case with Jackie French Koller's undistinguished fantasy series.  Colorful, brisk, easy to follow, and featuring a brave young heroine of just eleven years of age, A Wizard Named Nell has qualities that may recommend it to very young fantasy readers.  However, reduced down to basics, it is the tale of a princess on a quest to save her world from an all powerful Dark Lord-- a tale that is very familiar and has been told, rather better, many times before. <br /> <br />Originality never once rears its head in the tale of Nell's quest to become the next apprentice to the Keeper of the Light, whose job it is to hold the Dark Forces (capitals absolutely required) at bay.  The extent to which A Wizard Named Nell falls into fantasy cliches can be verified by looking at entries for \\"Dark Lord,\\" \\"Missing Heirs,\\" and \\"Minions of the Dark Lord\\" in Diana Wynne Jones's mercilessly satirical Tough Guide to Fantasyland, published in 1996.  Nothing is actually wrong with using a few fantasy tropes, but Koller slaps these in her story without ever pausing to fully explore any of them.  Eldearth feels like a movie set rather than a full realized world with its own history and rules.  Incongruous bits of modernity in what is otherwise a generic, quasi-medieval fantasy world are particularly apparent in the dialogue.  Raechel, the sweet, terminally ill child (see \\"Plague\\" in the Tough Guide) remarks of Nell's inevitable dragon sidekick, \\"She be so cute.\\"  Thankfully, the writing isn't always that bad, but some of it, combined with some very sloppy copyediting, is worth a cringe or two. <br /> <br />Good characterization might compensate for some of the book's other flaws, but Nell and her supporting cast possess little depth.  Adults, as in Harry Potter, tend to be either totally ineffectual (ifwell intentioned), or narrow minded, incompetent, and ultimately obstructive to the execution of Good by the young protagonist.  Nell herself is irritating in her perfection.  She is alone in being progressive, compassionate, and clear-sighted, but there is never any doubt that the conservative adults who surround her are uncomplicatedly wrong in their views.  (Most of them, however, praise her bravery and kindness.  Often.)  Koller's messages are perfectly sound, but the repeated emphasis on the need for social consciousness between different species, classes, and genders comes across as heavy-handed and unnecessarily didactic.   <br /> <br />There is no reason why children's fantasy cannot be original, intelligent, and profound, as well as entertaining.  Unfortunately, the Keeper series, despite its attractive covers (kudos to artist Rebecca Guay), isn't really any of the above.  There are, however, plenty of books that are.  Young fantasy readers are much better off with Sherwood Smith's Wren books, Tamora Pierce's Magic Circle quartet, or Diana Wynne Jones's Chrestomanci books, which all feature more interesting young protagonists and thoughtfully crafted magical worlds.	2004-12-26

In all fairness, it is a good introduction to all the presidents and has some interesting facts.<br /><br />Now, here are the problems I have with this book.<br /><br />First: Under the description of Richard Nixon, there is no mention of China, the END of the Vietnam war and the END of the draft.  Instead, the authors chose to speak ONLY about the Watergate scandal.  There was much more to the Nixon Presidency than just Watergate.  If they are going to speak about the negative, at least mention some of the positives to show a little balance.<br /><br />Second:  Under the description of Bill Clinton, the book states that \\"[t]he 1990s were good years for the country - fewer people were out of work and the U.S. was not at war.\\"  HELLO!  Do the authors not remember Kosovo, the situation in Somalia (i.e. Black Hawk Down), the first bombing of the world trade center, the situation in Haiti, constant activity in the Persian Gulf, planes being shot at in the no fly zone over Iraq, the Oklahoma city bombing, the U.S. bombing of an asprin factory in Africa, the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, multiple U.S. embassy bombings, etc?  While these were not full-blown wars (of which we have not technically had since WWII - only Congress declares war) they are still significant military endeavors and the infancy of the \\"War on Terror\\" that began post 9/11.  The Clinton Administration deployed our soldiers more times than any other President, albeit the majority of these actions were \\"peacekeeping missions.\\"  Additionally, the nation's unemployment reached its lows in 1997 through the latter end of 2001.  After 9/11, we saw unemployment hit 6.4% in June of 2003, but has since returned to a level of 5.4%, which is where we were from 1994 through early 1997 (This information can be verified at the bureau of labor website: [...]  So the point that I am making is that the authors paint a picture that everyone had a job and the whole world was holding hands during the 1990's, which simply is not true.  I'm not going to touch (no pun intended) the Lewinsky affair - it is mentioned.<br /><br />Third (And Final):  Under the description of George W.

However, as it is mentioned under the section on John Quincy Adams, if there is a tie, then CONGRESS votes and decides the outcome.

Maybe a section should have been added to the book to describe the electoral process.<br /><br />I am still debating whether or not to give this as a Christmas present.

It's just that one becomes rather frustrated with reading such fascinating conceptualizations of the nature of different aspects of the cosmos only to read in the end that \\"of course this can't be verified as of yet, maybe never.\\"  After a while, one is overcome by this creepy feeling of rereading a slightly less whimsical version of \\"Through The Looking Glass\\"-Lewis Carroll had a degree in Mathematics from Oxford as well.<br /><br />The physicist Richard Feynman (whom Greene clearly admires) once described theoretical physics as \\"imagination in a straight jacket.\\" Greene seems to have cast off the straight jacket and decided to chase after what may turn out to be, after all, white rabbits.	2004-12-18

Current President Zach Herney also gets a political boost for his pro-NASA campaign but he is waiting for the results to be verified by many sources before he goes public with the information.  Meanwhile, Sedgwick Sexton's rolling campaign keeps on attacking NASA and their spending and they appear to be headed on a one way road to the White House.  He deals with personal scandals while trying to help his ailing campaign.  President Herney sends intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton, Sedgewick's daughter, along with a team of experts to verify the find.  After a long journey to the arctic the discovery seems to be the greatest achievement of mankind when a subtle clue sends Rachel and the scientists on an frantic expedition.  What they find is the unimaginable: evidence of a scientific scandal.  One that could send the United States and the rest of the world into controversy.  Who is behind the scandal?  Why did they do it?  How did they do it?  Rachel becomes confused and tries to tell the president but she is attacked and is forced to flee.  Forced out onto an unforgiving landscape, she and two other scientists run for their lives they embark on an adventure for their lives and the truth.  She knows that she must survive and give the info to the President before he goes public with it.  Together, they find out the truth, but the truth is the most shocking deception of all.	2004-12-17

The semantic web is an intelligent web, that is, a web that can be intelligently used by computers.  There are two things you need to know about the semantic web.  First, it doesn't exist.  Second, it may never exist.  If this isn't enough information for you, and you want to look at what the future may hold in the area of an intelligent web, then I can't think of a better way to get an introduction to the technologies and ideas that may be part of the semantic web than by reading this book.<br /><br />The author of the book takes the layers of the semantic web as proposed by the W3C and looks at each one in turn, skipping over the familiar XML and XML schema layers.  The author starts with the RDF layer and gives one of the best explanations of RDF and RDF schema that you will find.  RDF is the potential meta-data language of the semantic web and the author makes it clear and understandable.  Other than XML, RDF is the most real layer of the W3C layer cake so this section is also the most accessible.  The next chapter delves into ontology which is vaguer and less clearly defined.  The chapter on web services seems a bit unnecessary except as how they fit into the semantic web.  A chapter on how intelligent agents may work is included.  The last section deals with how information may be verified for truthfulness and authenticity.<br /><br />If you are interested in RDF then you may want this book just for that section.  If you are interested in what the semantic web might look like then this book may be of interest.  If you are looking for practical programming samples or ways to build intelligent agents then this isn't the book for you.  This is an explorer's guide for those having no fear to tread into unknown waters.  This part of the web is still uncharted but this book will help you learn what technologies may be used to fill in the missing pieces of the map.	2004-12-17

This is part spiritual memoir, but it is also the 'blending of thoughts, ideas, experiences, and lives' of those he writes about in this guide.  This was his first books and very well received; he has followed up with REACHING TO HEAVEN and HEAVEN AND EARTH.  He appears to be a 'medium' as in the book, ROSE RED. <br /> <br />He discovered he was a psychic in the first grade of a Catholic school.  He writes, \\"We are all born with some level of psychic ability.\\"  At the age of eight, he had his first clairvoyant experience when he saw the illuminated hand of God coming from the ceiling.  Though the impact was impressive, he did not tell anyone.  He did not feel afraid, quite the opposite: peace, love and joy.  \\"I began to understand that there was much more to life than what I had been taught and what I could see through my physical eyes.  It was my secret\\" -- this revelation from God, as he felt that no one would believe him anyway. <br /> <br />He gives meditations to follow the relaxation exercises, which must be standard procedure for psychologists.  I learned the basic relaxation concept from Dr. Gregory Forman, PhD, to help with a chronic nerve pain.  It is similar way except for this addition: \\"As you exhale, imagine any negativity, stress, or anxiety that has been pent up in your body slowly leave...\\"  I like knowing that, as I used the basic inhale,exhale prior to a recent foot surgery.  I learn something useful from every book I read, it seems. <br /> <br />For his meditations, you need to use the visualization technique as well.  If, however, you just want a quick way of relaxing from a day's stress, you can do the relaxation exercise by itself.   His three major meditations are: Saying Goodbye to Loved Ones and Sending Them on Their Way, Forgiveness and Reegrets, and Rediscovering Your Power. <br /> <br />Love celebrates life, an emotional expression of the human heart.  We should be aware of what we were, what we are, and what we are yet to become in a never-ending journey.  Rich Levine reminds you that 'dreams are not a waste of time; your imagination is where your future begins.\\" <br /> <br />Since I've been against the death penalty for a long time, I was interested in his 'take' on capital punishment.  Like me, he believes that the confined person suffers more from the loss of freedom and being treated as less than human.  He advises everyone to look at the situation from a spiritual point of view and not from an emotional standpoint.   <br /> <br />His thesis, which I find frightening, is that \\"when a spirit of an individual is forced out of the body by capital punishment, the personality of the criminal remains exactly the same as it was prior to execution.\\"  According to him, the soul roams endlessly throughout the lower astral world with other like-minded souls; these tormented ghouls (my word) carry a mind-set of anger and hatred, seeking revenge for their untimely deaths and search the earth for weak humans whom then can mentally influence to kill or hurt others.  This is a scary thought, but I'd rather not dwell on this possibility. <br /> <br />Sylvia Browne expounds the 'life after death' part as a happy experience and has many devoted followers.  I sent one of her books (in audio form) to Ken Young for his birthday last year -- when he was going through a rough time -- which he said he would share with his mother, a devotee of the psychic. <br /> <br />Guess I'm a skeptic as I read for the information and not the consolation.  This I found very interesting: Psychic energy in plant and animal kingdoms.  Plants are extremely sensitive and often thrive when they sense a gentle and friendly environment where they feel loved and well-cared for.  Once, while visiting a friend, he \\"heard\\" a high-pitched sound and \\"felt\\" a screaming vibration.  He noticed that the house plants were dried up and dying, screaming for water.  It was verified that they had not been watered in over two weeks.  Maybe he saved some of them by being there.  The magic of life comes in all forms, shapes and sizes, even plants. <br /> <br />Animals have a sixth sense and can sense a disaster before it strikes, often hiding in a closet or underneath furniture.  They are highly sensitive to human anxiety as well.  It's not a coping mechanism but an inborn instinct they use to protect themselves. <br /> <br />Sometimes, humans need this instinct.  So often in life it is our desire to be loved and we tend to fall victim to our own making.  Because we believe it is what is expected in order to have the love of someone else, we compromise who we truly are.  We create a false image.  When I read the book BEEN THERE DONE THAT, I lost faith in my \\"first love\\" (I was president of his fanclub in Knoxville.) and was told by Chick Watkins, \\"You believed in his image.\\"  We have given our power and a piece of ourselves to the person we love.  We have left our centeredness and given away a part of our self-wholeness.  We can never be truly happy until we live our own lives. <br /> <br />This book has something for everybody.  Since we are all distinct individuals, we seek different interpretations in books like this.  It has certainly been a popular item.	2004-12-15

For those who find drinking one's own urine revolting, then why do you eat meat products which have rotten blood (urine comes from blood that is alive) and bacteria from the animals intestines (beef and pork) which permeates and \\"ages\\" the meat and makes it taste good?  <br /> <br />Urine is liquid which has been flowing through your veins in the past few minutes and is filtered of impurities by the liver and passed on to your bladder as antiseptic and has no bacteria in it as does the blood and meat of the beef, pork, chicken and other animal products you eat.  Urine has no connection to the fecal material that is processed in a different manner and those who try to connect the two are unable to reason correctly. <br /> <br />Ingesting urine was a very difficult decision but after doing a lot of research I finally took the plunge, so to speak.  Within three weeks the athlete's foot condition that I've had for 60 years disappeared (yeah, I tried the oral prescription medicine for six months, and had toenails removed, and that didn't work), pre-cancer conditions have both disappeared and receded (as verified by a dermatologist), burning eyes and night sensitivity to light - a 70+ year condition - are totally gone.  There are also many other benefits I could mention but these are just a few, and this is after just two months of using it. <br /> <br />For those who want to upchuck at the thought of drinking their own urine, then why has it been done with significant benefits with no adverse effects for thousands of years?  Our Western view of \\"dirt\\" has produced a sick, antiseptic, antibiotic world which is producing super disease that the drug companies can no longer keep up with. When you lose your health (which many who read this will eventually do) you will kick the MD's in their wallet and seek real healing modularities of which urine therapy is but one. <br /> <br />This is by far the best book there is on the subject of urine therapy. <br /> <br />	2004-12-14

But the actions of some are so incredibly mindless that they boggle the imagination. With some people, the supreme acts of stupidity they have committed has either led to their demise or to the inability to spread their tainted cells to future generations via reproduction. Those who have succumbed to stupidity in this manner are proud recipients of a Darwin Award, named after Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution and natural selection.<br /><br />This book divides it winning entries into those that have been confirmed, those that are honorable mentions, and those that have been proven to be urban legends. Confirmed entries have been verified as true. Honorable mentions are given to individuals who committed gross acts of stupidity but didn't actually die or lose the ability to reproduce. .And urban legends are those stories which are known to be false but have been included in this book anyway because so many people believe them to be true.<br /><br />The humor used in this guide is a little bit on the morbid side, and this fact could turn some readers off. The book talks about these people and the things they did and, in many cases, it seems to be making fun of the incident, even when people died as a result. It is all meant in good fun, but it could be objectionable to more sensitive readers.<br /><br />As far as the stories themselves go, I found that many of them are quite humorous, particularly those that involve a man's private parts. It's shocking to read some of the outrageous things than men will do in order to get off. Some can be chalked up as lapses in judgment, but others are so weird they defy any sense of rationalization. (...)<br />A book like this may not be to everyone's liking, both for its callous sense of humor and for the briefness of many of the entries. No story is more than two pages long and some are only a single paragraph. This isn't always enough to adequately describe an event thoroughly. Still, this book is a pretty good one, filled with plenty of funny incidents of natural selection taking place, adding proof to Darwin's theory that less intelligent members of society are gradually eliminated from the gene pool each and every day.isn't always enough to adequately describe an event thoroughly.

Would the FDA try to squelch the doctor's findings and try to prevent him from practicing?  Cancer treatment is a huge industry for big pharmaceutical companies and cancer treatment centers.  Would they go out of business if there was a simple, nutritional protocol with excellent results against cancer?  What if simple nutritional methods to nourish the body's own immune system and prevent cancer's spread are much better than the expensive, toxic radiation and high-priced proprietary toxic chemo drugs dispensed at today's oncology centers?  What if the cancer drug your doctor dispenses depends on which drug company's pharmaceutical rep takes him out to lunch?  This book tells you that \\"what if,\\" in detail, and in real life.  It details various government agencies' attempts to harass Dr. Binzel through \\"enforcers\\" and the legal system.  Binzel presents an astonishing record of 85% 5-year survival among his patients with primary cancer and 60% survival for those with metastatic cancer.  These results can't be verified, because of the privacy of his patients' medical records.  But some of the survivors agreed to let their names and medical histories be released, and they are shown in this book.  The book also shows you the 3-part treatment system Binzel used - 1. Vitamins and enzymes, 2. vegetarian diet, and 3. nitrocilides, or vitamin B17, which is found in everyday foods like millet, lentils, alfalfa sprouts, garbanzo beans and apple seeds.  This is an enjoyable read if you suffer from cancer, or know someone who does.  It is not the promise of a cure.  The basic idea is to support and enhance your body's own natural defenses against cancer.  Highly recommended, whether you support today's cytotoxic chemotherapy methods or not.  The FDA would never try to lie to you, or manipulate the results of drug studies funded by big drug companies, would they?  Drug companies contribute topolitical campaigns, but that doesn't influence laws about our health, does it?	2004-12-12

It chronicles the search for pyramid power and the struggle to find out just what makes the pyramid so awesome.  According to Schul the pyramid can do all the things listed on the inside flap/book description.  There are practical ways to apply this to your life.  Food may be kept in custom made pyramid shaped containers, and will keep fresh longer.  But to harness the full effects of pyramid power one should live in a pyramid shaped house.  A section of photos in the center of this book provides diagrams of the King's Chamber in the Great Pyramid, our best template for maximum power, and diagrams of a hypothetical pyramid home. <br /> <br />Throughout the book Schul refers to experimentation by himself and others into pyramid power.  Experiments with plants grown in pyramid shaped enclosures have produced some suggestive results.  There are also chapters on the effect on solids and liquids of being stored inside pyramids.  Here the evidence is vaguer.  Case studies replace studies and it more describes an area that could be researched than a conclusive discovery. <br /> <br />The book is overall soft science.  To be fair Schul often gives the name of a book, article or person and inserts enough information into the text that the sources could be verified.  I prefer to see footnotes or endnotes. <br /> <br />Overall this is an interesting book.  It is a bit kooky, but it does raise some interesting points.  From the cover illustration showing a naked girl floating inside a mystical pyramid to suggestions on building you own personal pyramid tent for meditation this book is a conversation piece.	2004-12-10

He has a certain view of Islam and for that reason he cannot achieve to be neutral. However, if one sincerely wishes to know what real Islam is all about, there is obviously one source to look at: QURAN. Not what people say, not what people do in the name of Islam, but only Quran. If there are acts, expressions done and said by people that are in contradiction with Quran, then it means they are wrong according to the Quran. In other words, extremely wrong, brutal acts and words of some people, even if they are majority, cannot be considered Islamic and Islam cannot be judged based on that. It wouldn't be fair. You cannot judge a teacher by looking at his student's acts and say that the teacher must be really bad and he must have thought such bad things to him. That could be true, but to find out that, you should first talk to the teacher, and see what he really says and teaches.  <br /> <br />Why doesn't anybody do the same thing when it is Islam in question?  The world 'Islam' means peace, Allah calls people to  peace. Quran summons people to peace and love and says if you kill one innocent person you will be considered to have murdered the entire humanity and if you help survive one person you will be considered to have helped the entire humanity. (Think about the situation of those according to Quran that kill thousands of innocent people in the name of Islam).  And jihad means the struggle to be a better person. The other war (Jihad) is unwanted and undesired and is the last resort and Muslims shall be fair even to their enemies. Quran praise those Muslims who give their foods to prisoners of wars when Muslims themselves are hungry, and when those prisoners killed their brothers a few minutes ago. Islam orders peace, compassion and tells Muslims to treat well to everyone, commands them never to force anyone to believe. It orders rich people to help poor.  <br /> <br />Except for the last two centuries, Islam has always been the greatest civilization of the world, in science, in art, since its beginning. Muslim scholars' works led the way to Renaissance in Europe. Their works on medicine, mathematics, geography were used as textbooks in universities across Europe for a long time. They were the highest civilization because they adhered to Quran, because Quran praises peace, modernity, art, highest moral values.  <br /> <br />Although crusaders slaughtered numberless innocent Muslims and Jews (this is not to say Christianism is bad, because Bible tells Christians to love their enemies, it is because those people were wrong) Muslim commanders never responded the same way, forgave those commanders that killed innocent women and children and never did any harm to anybody. Ottoman Empire accepted Jews fleeing from slaughter in Spain and provided a safe haven for people of various religions and nationalities for 600 years, because they ruled according to Quran. Jerusalem, which is now the place of tears, used to be a place where Jews, Christians and Muslims lived peacefully together under Ottoman rule.  <br />These are facts and can be verified by looking at very basic text books.  <br />ALL INTELLECTUAL PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, I REQUEST ONE THING FROM YOU: DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF JUDGING ISLAM BY LOOKING AT THE ACTS OR WORDS OF SOME PEOPLE. TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT SAYS BY LOOKING AT ITS SOURCE: THE HOLY QURAN	2004-12-08
US	50487699	R2L0PUONZWT74C	0131008250	380979331	Bioinformatics Computing	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Comprehensive Introduction to the filed of Bioinformatics	Bergeron wrote this book such that if you have a computer background, you can relate to the topic at hand, and if you have a biology background, you can pick up the material quickly.  He uses one to teach the other, and does so rather comprehensively.  Major topics and areas of interests in bioinformatics are covered, such as: <br />* Databases <br />* Networks and the Internet <br />* Bioinformatics search engines <br />* Data mining techniques <br />* Statistics <br />* Pattern Matching <br />* Simulation techniques and modeling <br /> <br />Any of these topics deserve a volume of books dedicated to them, but the author gives the readers enough information that can be useful in determining where to go next.  Even though the topics are mostly computing related, the author takes a great care at talking about these topics in the context of Bioinformatics.  He even lists the specific applications of each topic at the beginning of each chapter to aid the reader in relating to the topic at hand.  For example, after reading the chapter on modeling and simulation, you would know that modeling is used to determine the efficacy of drugs and to determine drug side effects during the drug discovery process.   <br /> <br />Databases are probably one of the most important and well known tools in Bioinformatics.  The enormous amount of data available for analysis requires large and fast databases.  In fact, the amount of data in bioinformatics doubles every eighteen months, so databases and database design is an integral part of bioinformatics computing.  In addition to the vast amount of raw data (sequence data and protein data for example) that is stores in databases, the analysis such as pattern matching, simulation and visualization of data requires constant access to databases.  The author talks about what are know as primary databases, databases that are used to store raw data, and other value added databases, the one's that store analyzed and/or verified data.  One thingthat reader gets out databases is the realization of what the data life cycle is in the bioinformatics world, and how it affects all the application areas of bioinformatics. <br /> <br />The databases around the world are either somehow integrated together ease the task of data discovery and data mining.  Due to the vast amount of information available, various data mining techniques have been developed over the years to assist in finding the data that a researcher is looking for.  Tasks such as data enrichment, missing value analysis for sequence data, data characterization and data distribution analysis mark some of the tasks that data mining techniques needs to accomplish.  A number of data mining techniques such as hidden Markov Models, Decision Trees, Neural Networks  and Genetic Algorithms are talked about and the pro's and con's of each one is discusses in detail.  A bioinformatician needs to be at least aware of the various data mining techniques and should have an overview how they work and why they work in general.   <br /> <br />After the data has been discovered, a method of visualization that can get the point across, per se, needs to be used.  Visualization and simulation techniques are talked about to show the reader what a bioinformatician needs to do with the information found.  There are a number of graphical tools available out there, some free and some not, that are used heavily in this business to aid the understanding of the vast amount of information that is available.  Various modeling techniques are being used today to aid with the drug discovery process and figuring out the side effect of newly developed drugs.  I would say that this area of bioinformatics will see the most growth in the coming years, and the author, Bryan Bergeron, does a great job discussing this topic.   <br /> <br />Statistics is another technique used heavily in bioinformatics computing.  Even though most of the statistical tools, Matlab and many others, have been usedfor a number of years, one must know the theory and reason behind using numerous statistical techniques in Bioinformatics.  These techniques are integrated into bioinformatics search engines and the software applications for modeling and simulations, but one still needs to know how they work.  Bioinformatics is a new field of study, and not by any means been perfected, so there are still a number research track and advancements that are still untapped, thus making the theory behind how some of the available tools work very important in this field.   <br /> <br />Bryn Bergeron in Bioinformatics Computing gives the necessary background for anyone interested in the field of bioinformatics.  After reading this book, a reader can get a good idea of which area s/he wants to pursue further.  The topics are broken into logical units that can aid the reader in realizing what specific field of bioinformatics is more interesting than others.   <br /> <br />Even if you don't decide to pickup one of many advanced books in this topic, you should know about an industry that is growing rapidly, and Bergeron's book can aid you to do just that.   <br /> <br />	2004-12-07

By his own admission, he put her before his own wife and children which strongly hints that this was not a healthy relationship at all.  By all accounts, Diana's private world was very different than her public image.  She was emotionally warped, probably due largely to the complete lack of emotional stability in her childhood which carried on throughout her adult relationships as well. <br /> <br />And while the Queen was roundly criticized for not revealing that Paul Burrell had told her that he had some of Diana's personal items for safekeeping, I think there's far more to it than that when you look at it more closely.  If this conversation did in fact, take place (which I doubt it did), then why didn't he tell his lawyers this after he was arrested?  His absolutely RIDICULOUS response was that he \\"didn't think it was important\\", either shows him to be a total moron or a liar.  If I was accused of robbing a bank at 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon, the first thing you would do is to give the name of SOMEONE---anyone, who can back up your claim that would prove your innocence. <br /> <br />All he would have had to say was \\"I told Her Majesty that I was taking these items for safekeeping\\".  His lawyer would have contacted the Queen's Private secretary with this information and the Queen could have either verified it or not.  Had she verified it then and there, the charges again Mr. Burrell would have been dropped immediately.  The only reason for someone not to provide this vital information to their lawyer would be because the conversation never happened. <br /> <br />Even giving Mr. Burrell the benefit of the doubt here and say that he did have this conversation with the Queen, by his own admission he told her he was taking \\"a few\\" of Diana's possessions.  When the police raided his home, there were literally hundreds of her personal items---not \\"a few\\".  I don't believe he planned on selling any of these things, but it is a strong testament to his completely warped obsession with her---an obession that he still seems to have to this very day.  I think the Queen saved his sorry ass from a prison term, not because of this fictional conversation, but to prevent him from revealing royal secrets that would inevitably come out in court. <br /> <br />I would suggest that Mr. Burrell seek professional counselling in order for him to get beyond Diana.  She's been gone for 7 years now and it's certainly time for him to let go and move on. <br />	2004-12-02

Moose's exposition of the first six chapters of Genesis is necessary reading for two audiences:  serious students of Genesis who already believe the account and the self-styled enlightened who have outgrown the ancient legend (as they might claim).  The believer should study this \\"midrash\\" to appreciate the \\"adult\\" version of the text.  The skeptic should study it to realize their instincts were correct, in so far as they rejected the \\"simple\\" translation (noting the simple translation should not be asked to defend itself at a scientific level, but that's a digression); they should now hurl their intellect against the \\"adult\\" version of the text.  This exposition is profoundly satisfying to the scientific mind.<br /><br />This is an important work to return to as science uncovers more and more of \\"how\\" the universe works, especially at a sub-atomic level.  No matter how well our science can explain \\"how\\" thinks work, science is profoundly clumsy and clueless in addressing the \\"why\\" of things.  This expert narrative is very satisfying on both counts.<br /><br />The ancient Jewish sages taught that the more one knows of how the universe worked, the greater one's ability to influence and, in certain narrow ways, directly manipulate creation.  Undertaking such direct measures required a greater understanding of the purpose of everything within creation, for to misuse or abuse creation is profoundly evil; one must possess a verified level of holiness.  These concepts were very closely held. It seems a little bit of Torah knowledge is a dangerous thing.	2004-12-01

In order to keep the scarcely maintained world peace, the role of the continued Japan-U.S. friendship and alliance is unshakable. Throughout the Cold War era and up to the present day, there has been some serious friction recorded, especially in the area of trade relative to the export of textiles and steel, also in the area of discussions as to increasing Japan's defense capabilities, and to restructuring of Japan's economic system. However, these items of discussion have been, without exception, items of national interest. Both nations, Japan and U.S., have tried to mutually resolve the problems and to reach the satisfactory resolutions and these efforts and achievements are universally recognized. <br /> <br />However, for the past few years, some peculiar anti-Japanese campaigns have been started in the U.S., and they have been escalated as the time passed. We are deeply concerned that the new serious friction between Japan and the U.S. has expanded as a result of these campaigns. The reason we express our concerns is that these anti-Japanese activities have been developed in the U.S., but aren't related directly to the national interests of either country. It is our assertion that there is someone of the third world trying to set them up from behind. <br /> <br />Specifically, Chinese-American Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking, which was published in July 1997 in the U.S., and the wave of anti-Japanese campaigns agitated by her claims are sitting at the center of this problem. The book's contents do not present verified facts, and furthermore, they represent the quite opposite. As a result, those Japanese who are shocked with such an injustice are not few. For this twisted representation of the historical facts of the 'Nanking Massacre', even a monthly Japanese magazine, called Sekai which has been a representative of the group which has admitted the 'Nanking Massacre', can't have helped but express its disagreement and published an unusual explanatory statement. <br />	2004-11-29

Celina Sanchez is a private consultant to the wealthy with personal problems and isn't at all used to having visions of a serial killer in action.  Eve isn't convinced that hiring Sanchez as a consultant will be worth the money, but she will take all and any offers of help.  <br />  <br />The public would be mightily freaked out if they knew all the details of the latest killing in the park.  The removal of the eyes, for instance.  Is the killer seeking recognition or are the victims more personal targets?  There's a man out there with serious problems with the fairer sex, and Eve is convinced that the way to flush him out is to present him publicly with the faces of his hunters - all women. <br />  <br />This great future police series starring New York police lieutenant Eve Dallas has been right up there in the best seller's list for the 18 books prior to \\"Visions in Death\\".  There had to be a flat one eventually, and this is it.  The series may at last be running out of puff as there isn't anything new to offer in this latest installment in the life and times of the snarly but brilliant Eve and her too perfect husband, Roarke.   <br />  <br />All the usual suspects feature with all their familiar and lovable quirks, but this novel is really only a time passer.  Still a good book, but compared its predecessors, \\"Visions in Death\\" is only average.  Good twist there at the end but it seems more of an afterthought in a rather pedestrian plot, saved by its characters and the updates for what's going on in their relationships.  Is there an end in sight for this series?   This book would seem to indicate we are due for the big wind up. <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-28

Skinner Reprint Series)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Cover Description From Actual Book	The contingent relationship between actions and their consequences lies at the heart of Skinner's experimental analysis of behavior. Particular patterns of behavior emerge depending upon the contingencies established. Ferster and Skinner examined the effects of different schedules of reinforcement on behavior.  <br /> <br />An extraordinary work, Schedules of Reinforcement represents over 70,000 hours of research primarily with pigeons, though the principles have now been experimentally verified with many species including human beings. At first glance, the book appears to be an atlas of schedules. And so it isthe most exhaustive in existence. But it is also a reminder of the power of describing and explaining behavior through an analysis of measurable and manipulative behavior-environment relations without appealing to physiological mechanisms in the brain. As en exemplar and source for the further study of behavioral phenomena, the book illustrates the scientific philosophy that Skinner and Ferster adopted: that a science is best built from the ground up, from a firm foundation of facts that can eventually be summarized as scientific laws. <br /> <br />Hope this helps.	2004-11-26

I have researched Lake Michigan shipwrecks for 20 years and I own several hundred books about Great Lakes shipwrecks and nearly 100 titles about Lake Michigan shipwrecks specifically.  Comparatively speaking, this book is very superficial.  The book treats a few hundred Lake Michigan wrecks and fails to even mention that at least 2000 other historically verified total loss Lake Michigan shipwrecks are known.  I also noted several relatively serious factual errors in the specific wreck accounts.  All the wrecks detailed in this book are already covered in existing books and it appeared that little original archival research went into the book's preparation, as evidenced by the book's bibliography.  The book would have benefited from some contextual historical material about the social and economic conditions that caused so many wrecks on Lake Michigan.  I believe any reader with a background in Lake Michigan maritime history will be disappointed by this book's lack of perpective, historical context and depth.	2004-11-23

Her main argument is that while many have claimed that tradition is merely invented, in Japan tradition is not so much invented as it is preserved in phantasmagoric images.  In order for modernity to persist \\"modernist nostalgia must preserve, in many senses, the sense of absence that motivates its desires\\" (10).  Ivy explores ways in which the objects of nostalgic desire are preserved, demonstrating how \\"elements of a revivified past operate as the amplified elements of the stylishly novel\\" (57).  She argues that Japan represents an aspect of what Jameson has called the retro mode: \\"the desperate attempt to appropriate a missing past is now refracted through the iron law of fashion change and the idea of the `generation'\\" (57).<br /><br />  Many have noted that Ivy's text, while very theoretically dense and reliant on Lacanian psychoanalysis, is very useful for a variety of other contemporary phenomena; there seem to numerous examples of persons \\"longing for pre-modernity, a time before the West, before the catastrophic imprint of westernization.  Yet the very search to find authentic survivals of pre-modern, prewestern Japanese authenticity is inescapably a modern endeavor, essentially unfolded within the historical condition that it would seek to escape\\" (241).<br /><br />  In examining this longing in Japan, Ivy presents the oral as both creating and fulfilling the desires for those objects of desire which are perceived as vanishing but not yet vanished.  In discourses about the production of knowledge as both local and oral (18), she argues that a \\"double inscription-as both superfluous and essential, marginal and traditional-is necessary for loss to emerge as recoverable\\" (25).  Through this process, the Japanese homeland becomes a place one was supposed to discover, as \\"Japan beckoned as something strangely familiar: the native remote\\" (47).  In the face of the changes following the opening of Japan and the rapid industrialization, the sense of nostalgia for the Tokugawa period gave rise to a situation in which the \\"surviving numinous became the romantic object of those caught up in the disenchantment of the world\\" (73).<br /><br />  Ivy argues that furusato is the concept that unites these two desires arising out of the experience of modernity merge: \\"the desire to encounter the unexpected, the peripheral unknown, even (and even especially) the frightening\\" and \\"a countervailing desire, pushed by an opposite longing, to return to that stable point of origin, to discover an authentically Japanese Japan that is disappearing yet still present\\" (105).  The modern longing for something new and exotic, by means of which Japan has itself been reinscribed as worthy of (re)discovery, is merged with the nostalgic longing to return to the way things once were, a longing that can only be experienced through their loss.  Ivy notes, however, that even in \\"authentic\\" rituals of mushi matsuri, \\"exemplify the modern desire to keep the uncanny at bay-to evoke the real without allowing its irruption into everyday life\\" (140).  Whereas these rituals are seen to represent authentic Japan, that which was and remains Japanese despite the loss experienced elsewhere as the onslaught of an otherwise welcomed modernity, they are in fact reshaped according to the cultural logic which renders the loss bearable by asserting its return to its place of origin.  Ivy asserts that this represents \\"the duplicity of `tradition' itself: a transmission that always contains the possibility of betrayal, of an arbitrary selection from the past\\" (187).  The irony is that in searching for an authentic, essential, immutable past a selective forgetting, remembering, and reshaping takes place.<br /><br />  This loss, however, is necessary to assert the permanence of such traditions.  Ivy argues that \\"onlyfrom the position of loss can one assert that nothing has been lost; only when the seamless, unquestioned transmission of custom has been interrupted, does `tradition' emerge.  The realization of loss is forestalled, denied, by an insistence that nothing is lost.  It is denied by an idealization, a memorialization of place, a bracketing of practices, an assertion of continuity\\" (188-190).  This very process is taking elsewhere.  Only by having experienced the loss of that for which they create a longing can many come to argue that that for which they long has never been lost.  Asserting that nothing has changed and that their institutions have weathered modernity without swaying course is the trope in which those who have experienced loss deny this loss.  Such desire, both in Japan and elsewhere, \\"sustains vanishing (but not yet vanished) forms of modernity\\" (237).  Just as taishu engeki and the trances at Mount Osore \\"exist as ghostly reminders, as potentially scandalous presences that, by all rights, should not be there-yet which must be there, vanishing, to act as constitutive reminders of modernity's losses\\" (243, emphasis original), so too do many of those who express a displaced nostalgia serve as a reminder of the losses incurred through modernity.  The worry, however, is that in ignoring the changes taking place about them, many who daily embody the type of nostalgia about which Ivy writes may follow the same path as those in postmodern Japan: \\"not only has the imagined object of loss vanished, but even the sense of loss itself.  All voices and forms of language seem equally present, equally homogenous.  Within this mass-mediated space, the very possibility of complex dialectical images is thus foreclosed\\" (246).  Ivy provides a language through which one may issue a warning to those who would simply cling to practices of an era gone by and likewise to those who would rather forget what we have lost in coming to modernity; a dialectic is necessary, a dialectic that recognizes both the future orientation of modernity and the nostalgic longing for tradition verified through dead ancestors.  It must not be forgotten, however, that both of these longing are the product of the experience of modernity.om the position of loss can one assert that nothing has been lost; only when the seamless, unquestioned transmission of custom has been interrupted, does `tradition' emerge.

Harding and His Administration (Signature Series)	Books	4	17	21	N	N	Harding Seen for the First Time	The Harding Era brought to the reader, for the first time, an accurate and fair account of the Warren G. Harding Presidency.  Harding had been (and in some respects still is) the most maltreated president in our nation's history.  His reputation plummeted soon after his untimely death in office, and misconceptions and lies soon became accepted as fact rather than fiction.  Murray's work shows some interesting aspects of Harding's two and a half years in office:<br /><br />· The myth of a smoke filled room does disservice to Harding, who through effective campaigning and a natural congeniality, was able to secure the 1920 nomination, and it does a disservice to the supposed power brokers, some of whom continued to vote against Harding until the end.  Uncertain times and two bull-headed front-runners more than party bosses pulling the strings of a puppet Harding made a dark-horse Harding nomination possible.<br />· Harding was able to bring governmental spending under control by creating, under the executive branch, the office of the budget.  As well, he championed and was able to accomplish the Washington Naval Conference, which set the stage for military size and ability following post World War One. His policies have been shown to be wanting, but in his day were seen as viable to an isolationist nation.<br />· The Teapot Dome scandal, which has historically been the Achilles heal of the Harding administration, is seen in the light of historical research:  it was only in the papers for a brief time and Harding, by transferring control of governmental oil reserves from one cabinet secretary to another was simply following what was thought to be the good advice of his cabinet.  He was not involved in the scandal nor could he really be faulted for what was for him an uncomplicated administrative transfer.<br />· The Harding era ended a recession and set the stage for republican dominance throughout the 1920s.  It is shown that both Coolidge and Hoover built on this base.  And, no matter how the slogan came about, \\"Normalcy\\" became the catchword of the era.  Few presidents have been able to define an era as the Harding campaign did.<br />· Both presidents Coolidge and Hoover have hindered Harding's reputation.  Both had served in the Harding cabinet and either could have spoken up for their deceased colleague to counter some of the hearsay that was accepted as fact.  Yet Harding was by then a political albatross, and they both stayed silent.<br /><br />Murray also clearly shows the weakness of Harding as a man and president.<br /><br />· His sexual prowess was less accepted, even to a roaring 1920s, than it might have been later on.  Although verified accounts of his exploits are less than the rumors and stories surrounding him, (Murray shows the idea of sex in the oval office closet to be basically another lie turned into fact), Harding was no moral beacon.  As the 20th century closed in the United States Harding was remembered as a 1920s Bill Clinton.  Harding could have only blamed himself for this.<br />· Personally he governed by consensus, weakness, and some executive planning.  The speeches during his Western and Alaskan tour seem to show a man growing into the office and wanting to exercise more presidential authority.  I personally think that had Harding lived he would have weathered the scandals, won re-election, and been remembered better.  Yet, his death and his many hidden papers, for many years presumed destroyed, allowed the various Harding myths to emerge.  By being a largely ineffective leader of questionable moral character, Harding is to be blamed for a good portion of this as his weak administration and legacy could not counter-act public perception.  Most notably in his mistakes was choosing the notorious Albert Fall to be in his cabinet.  Fall more that anyone helped destroy Harding's reputation.<br />· It is clear that Harding neither made the times, nor did the times make Harding.  Brought to officeby a country tired of war and wanting to be left alone without a League of Nations or similar entanglement  (and helped by a number of first time voting women who found a handsome Harding elect able), he brought with him an undistinguished political record and the nostalgia of and for a small town America.  Thankfully most political contests have brought forth a higher caliber winner than did the 1920 election.<br /><br />Murray concludes by stating that Harding probably should not have been president.  But that he was president.  This second part alone merits Murray's excellent book.  Years ago, when beginning a rather short-lived career as a high school history teacher, I visited the Harding Home and grave in Marion, Ohio.  The tour of the home was a bit comical and somewhat less than professional, as a rather obese guide meandered us around the house, at times blowing his nose and checking his handkerchief for contents. The Harding grave was closed to the public, but I got in and saw his grave covered by garden hoses and a soda bottle.  The tour was a metaphor for the Harding years.  It was not enough to strive to be America's \\"Best Loved President\\".  The administration needed more and could not provide it, and has strived since then to gain respect. Some Harding aficionados have suggested that Harding should not be considered America's worst president, but should be elevated to the row of bottom tier presidents (based on whatever scale is used in rating presidents). Overall this is not saying much, but it does say something.  Reading Robert K. Murray's The Harding Era might just convince the reader that this bump up to the bottom is justified.left alone without a League of Nations or similar entanglement  (and helped by a number of first time voting women who found a handsome Harding elect able), he brought with him an undistinguished political record and the nostalgia of and for a small town America.

The author meticulously  documents Palestinian demographic trends, Jewish efforts to purchase lands, and the effect of these efforts on Arab peasants. Its only drawback is that its dispassionate non-polemical style at times makes for dry reading   <br /> <br />A previous reviewer (\\"ramacat\\") claimed to have read this work, but then claims he could not \\"confirm\\" some of the source material, and that supporting evidence was \\"bogus\\" , \\"misquoted\\", \\"misreported\\" , \\"unverified racist ramblings\\", and finally  \\"often just patently stupid\\". These comments seem odd and it is clear this person never even gazed upon this book. <br />  <br />The author relies primarily on three types of sources. His demographic analysis relies on the work of a highly respected geographic demographer and academic; Prof. Roberto Bachi , as well as on British censuses conducted during the British mandate. The works of Pof. Bachi as well as British census data are both readily available at the research libraries in most major cities (they were at least at the 42nd st. research library at NYC). Thus for example he provides British census data to demonstrate Arab migration to Jewish settled areas by noting the dramatic increases in Arab populations in cities with a substantial Jewish populations or adjacent to rural Jewish settlements (i.e. Jerusalem, Haifa, Jaffa ect.) and the much more modest population increases (and at times decreases) in the Arab population of purely Arab cities or areas (i.e. Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah ect.). <br /> <br />In documenting Jewish land purchases he relies on archival records of the Jewish Agency. As these sources are in Hebrew and are located in Israeli archives, I doubt that the reviewer mentioned above attempted to \\"confirm\\" them seeing as he is writing from Thailand. <br /> <br />Finally the author relies on the reports of various British commissions and surveys  (i.e. Peel, Hope Simpson,Lewis French) to evaluate the effects of Jewish purchases on Arab peasants. Thus for instance he relates that in 1931, Lewis French conducted a survey of landlessness and eventually offered new plots to any Arabs who had been \\"dispossessed.\\" British officials received more than 3,000 applications, of which 80 percent were ruled invalid by the Government's legal adviser because the applicants were not landless Arabs. This left only about 600 landless Arabs, 100 of whom accepted the Government land offer. The Lewis French survey along with the Hope Simpson and Peel commision reports are readilly available at most research libraries, including the one in NYC mentioned above. <br /> <br />This books detractor \\"concludes\\" that all positive reviews come from \\"true believers\\". I think it is clear who the \\"true believer\\" is. <br /> <br />	2004-11-16

Other women begin to step forward, declaring that they were raped but later urged by the Jesuit brothers to keep silent.<br /><br />But is Eve's obsessive-even pathological-search for truth and justice a natural wish due to her being a journalist, or does it go deeper? Indeed, it goes much more deeper. For what is happening on campus is a metaphor for what happened to her beloved sister Tessa thirteen years ago. In solving the mystery of the cover-up, Eve will finally solve the mystery of her childhood, and her mind and soul will be in peace.<br /><br />There are two interlaced stories in this novel, both equally powerful and disturbing. Though the story begins like a traditional mystery, this is a mainstream novel and it should be read a such, keeping in mind that a formula-type ending doesn't apply here.<br /><br />The author uses present tense but this didn't detract me from submerging into the story.

Since then, western history of Persia has always been written from a Greek perspective, which was biased with a strong propagandist agenda.<br /><br />Pierre Briant has sought to overcome this long-ingrained Greco-centric view of the Persian empire through a very detailed & deeply analytical history which integrates all existing knowledge on the first full-scale Empire in Southwest Asia.  Writing originally in French in mid-90s, Briant approaches this history with 1) an analytical approach to the political narrative which seeks to lay bare the ideological elements ingrained in the Greek texts and 2) a sweeping overview of the politico-socio-economical organization of the vast Empire built on evidence verified on local levels.  What emerges clearly was the Persian Empire as a viable politico-economical super-structure that layered on top of deep-rooted local traditions.  The Empire infrastructure sustained for the 200 years that the classical Greek culture flourished, and that this infrastructure was inherited-- though not sustained-- by Alexander and his companions through conquest.<br /><br />This is a heavy tome as Briant tried to overcome a very deep-rooted academic historiographical tradition, so at times the writing can be tedious.  Also, this book does not seek to cover Zoroastrianism at all (beyond describing the royal Achaemenid ideology which the author neither identifies nor disscoiates with Zoroastrianmism).  However, the freshness in perspectives, plus the very well-rendered, top quality translation, makes the book a truly 'value-for-money' purchase in my view.	2004-11-15
US	49679088	R2LHJHQSSGBO1H	0812967852	448968193	The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Informative, independent of political inclination	Recently Lewis has been under harsh criticism. His critics contend that Lewis falsely and unnecessarily associated the conflict between the West and the radical Islam organizations of late as an extension of the medieval Christianity-Islam conflict. They also assert that Lewis had \\"missed-out\\" in understanding the impact of post-Ottoman developments to the dynamics of the modern Middle East. However in my opinion central to their criticism is the fact that Lewis had served the current administration as something of an advisor for the administration's Iraq policy (and \\"failed\\" at the war). Lewis, his critics claim, shares with Kemal Ataturk the conviction that Islam is fundamentally anti-modern, and asserts that a convincing display of Western power will accelerate the pace of the Middle East embracing democracy.    There are more than many things one can learn from this little book despite such criticism. To the eyes of a nonspecialist the book is found well organized, to the point, and extremely informative. I do not know for a fact whether Lewis associating the Crusade with the confrontation predates bin Laden's 1998 message to the world, but it was the title of this message (\\"Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders\\") that designated the Crusaders as the enemy of the World Islamic Front. Also mentioned in relative detail are the British and French occupations of the Middle East, the Soviet Union's influence in the region, as well as the stages in Middle East's formation of the perception of America.    The question of whether Kemal's way (total separation of religion from state) is the only way for Muslim countries to achieve democracy is in my view can only be verified through history. By this I do not mean (nor am I knowledgeable enough) to say that there cannot be a form of democracy that incorporates elements of religion. It is more to say that the world hasn't witnesses such system yet. And for this reason I find itdifficult to digest the criticism against this book. If the criticism were against the proponent of a failed policy it would be a different matter (I personally am against the intervention in Iraq). Luckily Lewis' such conviction is only mildly expressed in the afterwords of the book, and even then readers can decide for themselves.	2004-11-15

While his tone is sympathetic and humane, the author's case for critical thinking is urgent, firm and uncompromising.<br /><br />Early on, Sagan  addresses the seemingly paradoxical relationship between critical thinking and certainty.  He points out that science, the discipline most strongly dependent on critical thought, nevertheless thrives on doubt, error and revision.  Even mathematics, the scientific branch most likely to produce \\"eternal\\" truths, has to deal with controversy and uncertainty at its frontiers.  The strength of science is rooted in its error detection mechanisms and a willingness to revise its views if warranted by experimental results.  The net outcome is a structure that is messy at the edges ( the hubbub of today's findings) but solid at the core (a summation of results verified by feedback over time).<br /><br />From many different angles, Sagan argues that pseudoscience and religion fall short for very clear and simple reasons:  Pseudoscience either cannot produce enough data to allow proper judgments, or fails to evaluate critically the data it has.  Religion sets up arbitrary principles, declares them sacred, and enters a state of ideological paralysis about their veracity.  This pattern persists even when the \\"sacred\\" principles become readily testable (e.g. the configuration of the solar system, the origin and evolution of planet Earth, and the developmental history of living things).  Thus religions tend to converge on a structure which is the inverse of science.  At their outer edges, religions are strong in the sense that they provide social support and humanitarian services.  The closer one approaches core values, however, the weaker religions become because of their adamant refusal to test and verify claims which intersect with observable reality.<br /><br />Chapter 7, bearing the title of the book, traces the history of demonic phenomena from antiquity to the present-day exorcisms sanctioned by Rome.  In a rather startling quote, Plato blithely describes demons as something like divine city councilmen sent by Jehovah to watch over mortals.  The pathetic specter of demonology morphing into witch hunting still shocks with descriptions of persecution and execution via catch-22 rules that damn the accused no matter how they respond to charges.  The Taliban would have loved it.<br /><br />The only criticism I would make is that the book, written over nearly a decade, suffers a bit from sprawl and repetitiveness.  But this detracts only a little from readability, and not at all from the value of Sagan's message.  He really did see science as a candle in the dark that can help us learn to be skeptical, think critically, and use the priceless gift of intelligence wisely for the benefit of everyone.humanitarian services.

Unfortunately for Mr. Taubes, science eventually sorts things out and figures out what's real and what's not real.  Well, now fifteen years after the big Pons & Fleischmen announcement, it turns out that Cold Fusion is on the cusp of regaining legitmacy in the scientific community.  Not only has the U.S. Navy revealed a decade of clandestine Cold Fusion research, but numerous reputable labs around the world have verified that the Cold Fusion is real.   <br /> <br />While a well written, and fairly well researched book, Mr. Taubes' burial of Cold Fusion is going to more of a historical artifact in the long saga of Cold Fusion than the definitive last word for this controversal field of science.

Question to you guys:  <br />-Does someone with a science degree need to read a step-by-step book on how to mix baking soda and vinegar together jsut to see what happens?  <br />-Did you really think that the author would put the hundreds and hundreds of pages from the RFC's in the book?? HA!  <br /> <br />I'm VERY glad that the book was writin by a VoIP specialist and was verified by VOIP specialists and not an English Professor (i'm excusing the mistakes :P) <br /> <br />This book is a \\"Introduction\\" to VoIP with Asterisk. Not a VoIP bible!!! When you are dealing with Open-Source you are usually forced to scatter all over the net to find even basic documentation on what your working on.  <br /> <br />This book put Asterisk and all of its respective services into a simple, clear and informative reference. It helps you get an Asterisk box up and running with all its whistles and bells up in just a few days, and you actually understand whats going on!! It also gives you great ideas on how to market it as well ;). <br /> <br />Want to get into Open Source VoIP? Get this book!  <br /> <br />...for 50 bucks you CANT go wrong!	2004-11-05

In the sequel to CASTING THE FIRST STONE, Curtis has a new wife and a new church. Some habits are hard to break, as he will soon discover.  <br /> <br />Being out of the ministry for awhile after his disgraceful removal from Faith Missionary Baptist Church, Curtis feels the call from God to return. He receives an offer to pastor Truth Missionary Baptist Church, which consists of some of the former members, who did not believe the rumors that got him ousted from Faith. There is one condition to his new appointment. He must find a wife within a year. He chooses Mariah as his new wife; a sweet young lady he is dating whom deals with a few self-esteem issues and comes from a shameful background. She makes the perfect wife because she knows her place and knows nothing about his past transgressions.  <br /> <br />Curtis has developed a friendship with several prominent pastors who \\"school\\" him on how to manipulate the church to get what he wants to satisfy his lust for money. Curtis introduces these ideas to the deacons of the church, but is met with opposition. His pastor friends give him insight on how to deal with the opposition. Curtis is also consumed with the lust of the flesh. Mariah is the \\"perfect\\" wife in all areas but the bedroom. This causes him to reconnect with his former lovers Adrienne and Charlotte, the mother of his son. With the time it takes to run his church and romance two women outside of his wife, Curtis' relationship with Mariah and his daughter, Alicia begin to suffer.  <br /> <br />Alicia resents her father's relationship with his new wife. Her presence in his life means there is not a chance for her parents to reconcile and he does not have enough time to spend with her. She starts to act out rebelliously at home and at school. She finds support from her online friend, an older guy who she deceives into thinking she is older than she actually is. After Curtis breaks his promiseto Alicia, she agrees to meet her friend in person. The encounter occurs with traumatic results. Curtis' reaction to Alicia's ordeal shows her what he truly cares about.  <br /> <br />Mariah begins to suspect Curtis is seeing other women. Her suspicions are verified when she starts doing some investigating. She pulls her best friend in to help her figure out how to get out of her miserable marriage. The plan takes a different turn than they had anticipated and the results are truly explosive.  <br /> <br />Kimberla Roby has done it again. She has taken a real-life situation seldom talked about and has brought it before her readers for discussion. The follow up to CASTING THE FIRST STONE was pretty interesting. However, I would have liked to see more of what happens in the lives  <br />of the characters after the explosive climax.

One of the best ideas that was expounded in the book was the idea of BTN (better than nothing). Often in the dating relationships we form we settle for something mediocre because we believe it is better than nothing (which is probably true) and because of fears we all have of the unknown, but fail to realize that we could do better if we ended the relationship (as opposed to becoming stale in a BTN relationship) and looked to start anew with a different relationship. <br />Some other important ideas that author contributed was avoiding being unequally yoked (relationships of people of people of diametrically opposed politics and religious beliefs pretty much doomed, something which had been recently verified in my past two relationships), the important of marriage counselling (reduces divorce rates by about 70-80%), and how videos of prospective dates can be informative as to what kind of person they are. <br />However, despite the considerable amount of good info in the book there are some really dumb ideas. 1. Is the idea of waiting 2 years to enter into another relationship after a breakup (come on I only have so much time on this planet) as well as the waiting several weeks if not months to show any kind of physical affection (good luck getting any chemistry...) <br />     This book is a good book its just that some of the ideas she presents are irritating and others are pretty good (there are plenty which I haven't mentioned) and you have to be patient and discerning when reading the book.	2004-11-01

Bush, gave Dick Cheney the power and influence he has craved for so many years. This book, which to me was mostly very well researched and backed up by easily verified data, clearly illustrates what happens when a disengaged, unqualified president is \\"supported\\" by a stubborn, power-hungry ideologue. The danger that this pairing has put us all in, and the complete lack of accountability for the US's foreign relations status, economy, education and health-care systems, is described well by the author.<br /><br />The web of intrigue, the devious machinations of a man who has power that he is not qualified for, and the repercussions of his actions (and the inactions of Bush), reads like a spy novel. It is very worrying to see how one man and his cronies can drive a country in to the ground in just 4 years...<br /><br />Recommended reading - Democrats should be quoting from this book!	2004-10-28

The author himself wants to desperately believe that all this is true much like an evangelist wants to believe scripture. (A reviewer even found Biblical correlations!!)Physics is an experimental science and has to directly relate to observables. Physics requires mathematics as a means to an end. As Nobel laureate Dr. Sheldon Glashow put it \\"there are physicists and there are string theorists; conveniently string theory is perfectly safe\\" The mathematical curiosity that began it all should stay there. String theorists are very bright mathematicians, including Greene, but they seem to have sold something catchy and popular and this book is such an example. In the capitalist world that we live in today, that is not necessarily a bad thing but personally I expected more scientifically/logically even as a non-string theorist. The claim that the unifying laws of nature can be derived if \\"the string equations in multiple dimensions are worked out fully\\" is difficult to take as even approximate solutions may not exist (mathematically speaking). A new unifying theory has to come from elsewhere at least partially grounded both in General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics which have at least had experimental verification in their own domains. Maybe the string theorists can come up with something else.  <br /> <br />The historical developments of science are also covered better elsewhere.

It's interesting to note how criticism of this book has changed in 4 years.  When Mr. Barnes' book first came out in 2000, it was criticized because so-called experts claimed that Thomas Andrews could not have known about the quality of Titanic's steel (actually, how could he have NOT known?) or that Titanic would break, or that she'd overturn if the compartments were allowed to flood evenly.  Those people evidently failed to take into account that Mr. Andrews was one of the preeminent naval architects of his day, and was even called upon by rival shipbuilders to assist them in troubleshooting design flaws in their ships.<br /><br />It's interesting now to read critiques that say all one needs do is go to the Discovery Channel to get the same \\"secrets\\" that William Barnes speaks of.  I strongly suspect that Mr. Barnes' detractors have secretly hoarded his book over the past few years, researched and verified his past life memories, and then tried to take credit for things Mr. Barnes amazing past-life recall had long documented.  If people would only take the time to research a little about WHAT is now known, and WHEN it became known, they would realize that the information which came from Mr. Barnes' past-life regression (which occurred prior even to the publishing of his books and tapes) predates a great deal of now common knowledge.<br /><br />I credit Mr. Barnes with the courage to step out and tell his story, realizing that reincarnation is not yet accepted by many people in western culture.  As time passes, everything he wrote about Titanic's secrets -- down to the most arcane -- is being proved.  Others may give credit elsewhere to the information Mr. Barnes has released, but those of us who have followed his amazing story from the beginning (including the incredible synchronicities and even astrological verification between the Andrews and Barnes lifetimes), know that Bill Barnes is the genuine article.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book not only for its detailed account on the life of Thomas Andrews, but for the insight it provides to past-life researchers and those who themselves experience past-life recall.<br /><br />Kevin Doheny, BA, CHT, MBT<br /><br />Center Director<br /><br />Sound Mind & Body Healing Center<br /><br />Eagan, Minnesotaor its detailed account on the life of Thomas Andrews, but for the insight it provides to past-life researchers and those who themselves experience past-life recall. <br /> <br />Kevin Doheny, BA, CHT, MBT <br />Center Director <br />Sound Mind & Body Healing Center <br />Eagan, Minnesota	2004-10-19

Variously termed the Fourth Global War (the Third being the Cold War), the U.S.-Jihadist War, the U.S.-Al Qaeda War, or the U.S.-Islamist War, the very fact that three years into it that there is no agreed upon name is indicative of the ambiguous and divisive nature of the conflict.<br /><br /> Friedman traces the origins of Al Qaeda to the mujahideen of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, a force trained and supplied by the U.S., recruited and financed by Saudi Arabia (with Pakistan playing a vital role as well), a program initiated by the Carter administration and expanded by Reagan. While not condemning the operation, as Friedman believes that the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan was a key element in beating them in the Cold War, the operation did sow the seeds of Al Qaeda. These mujahideen were educated, battle-hardened, and very ideological - and not at all wanted back by their home governments (chiefly Saudi Arabia). Abandoned also by the Americans, incensed by the presence of Christian nations on holy Saudi soil during the first Gulf War, and increasingly intolerant of corrupt, American-supported regimes in the Islamic world, they sought to attack the U.S. chiefly because they wished to wound the country in such a way as to force it into intervening massively in the Islamic world. Such an intervention - preferably an invasion - would Al Qaeda hoped provoke a Muslim uprising, overthrowing regimes and ideally restoring the medieval Caliphate.<br /><br /> Friedman detailed the operational strengths and weaknesses of Al Qaeda. The original mujahideen were quite experienced with covert operations, largely from having worked side-by-side with the CIA, seeing first hand American covert operation tactics and technology. Al Qaeda expanded this knowledge by among other things continually testing U.S. intelligence in the 1990s, provokingthe system to see what responses were generated, checking for leaks in their organization, etc. Not only was this reflected in part by the African embassy bombings and the attack on the _U.S.S. Cole_ but also by the constant \\"chatter\\" that is heard worldwide (as an added bonus for Al Qaeda this chatter can also saturate the intelligence system, rendering it less sensitive to real threats).<br /><br /> The book details the entire strategic views of the United States, from pre-war to today. Friedman states that the U.S. was caught flat-footed by 9-11; not only was it tactically surprised, but it was strategically surprised (far greater than say Pearl Harbor, as the U.S. knew it was going to war with Japan). The U.S. early on in the war was forced to adapt Cold War plans the best it could to deal with the situation (such as protecting the President on 9-11 and waging war in Afghanistan) but continually had trouble grappling with fighting a global war against a non-state, elusive enemy, one that while heavily involved in Afghanistan was nonetheless not dependent upon on any one nation.<br /><br /> The war against Al Qaeda produced many problems for the administration. There is still a debate on whether to treat at least in some quarters the conflict against Al Qaeda as a law enforcement or a military issue. The FBI, one of the many agencies tasked to find Al Qaeda in the U.S. is primarily a law enforcement agency, not an intelligence agency, and by its very nature is often poorly suited to uncovering cells in the U.S. American intelligence has in the past few decades since the Bay of Pigs been obsessed with verifiable intelligence, everything needing a verified, documented source, rated arbitrarily he says on a scale of 1 to 5. If it does not, it might not make it into a final report or if it does it is severely downplayed.  Assumptions, unverified reports, and leaps of logic might not make it into final reports, perhaps written and filed away - which along with isolated bits of information \\"prove\\" to critics that the government \\"knew\\" something - but may in the end have no influence on decision makers.<br /><br />  Friedman states that the U.S. has two overall strategic goals in the war. First, it is to deny any possibility that weapons of mass destruction would fall into Al Qaeda's hands. The early days of the war saw Washington in a panic about this, particularly concerned with the status of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Second, the U.S. seeks to change the behavior of countries that for domestic reasons might support Al-Qaeda or otherwise be disinclined to work against them.<br /><br /> A large portion of the book is spent on the war in Iraq. Friedman maintains that the primary though unstated reasons were twofold; to end the perception that it was militarily weak and that Al Qaeda was going to prevail in the long run (in particular the U.S. was concerned with Saudi perception), and to provide a strategic base to fight Al Qaeda everywhere in the region; other concerns, though real, were secondary. Though the U.S. has achieved some strategic success in the war, the Iraq war showed many key intelligence failures; that Ahmed Chalabi (chief U.S. candidate for the Iraqi presidency) was an Iranian agent who fed the U.S. disinformation, the U.S. was unaware that the Shiites in Iraq had long ago been organized by Iranian intelligence after Desert Storm, and that Saddam Hussein from the very beginning had intended to fight a guerrilla war.<br /><br /> An interesting book, I liked how Friedman discussed not just military strategy but international politics, detailing  France's stance for instance on the Iraq conflict and American attempts to counter it as well as deals made with Iran and Russia in the fight against Al Qaeda, even Spanish politics following the Madrid bombings. The U.S got heavily involved in South Asian politics as part of the war on terror during the events after the December 13, 2001 attack on India's parliament, an event that might have resulted in another India-Pakistan war.	2004-10-17

Unless You Know to Ask	Books	5	13	13	N	N	I wish I could have read this several years ago	Medical Tests That Can Save Your Life: 21 Tests Your Doctor Won't Order... Unless You Know to Ask is exactly what as the title states.  Inside are nineteen conditions that are often not tested by doctors.  Each of the conditions gives a description of the physical condition, risk factors (separated by those that you can modify and those that you can't), your risk level, and tests you may want to request.  After the condition is explained in detail and the appropriate tests suggested, the book ends with a section that describes the tests including what the test checks for, how reliable it is, health risks, and approximate cost.  The final part of the book covers the standard treatment for the various conditions once they have been verified.<br /><br />One of the reasons these tests are often not given by doctors is because they don't show many symptoms until they are well advanced.  So how do you know you should request one of these tests?  The authors provide some of the circumstances under which you might want to request the test.  For example, hemochromatosis is most prevalent in people with a Celtic ancestry.  If you have a different ancestry you are unlikely to need to have the exam taken.<br /><br />Medical Tests That Can Save Your Life is a highly recommended book although I will have to admit that I am somewhat prejudiced.  I have several relatives whose lives would have been much better if someone had ordered the test for hemochromatosis earlier in their lives.	2004-10-15

US	49283720	R1KP2O8AHCF8WP	0201750392	85799644	Solaris Systems Programming	Books	2	30	42	N	N	Not a substitute for Stevens' APUE	Despite the claim on the back cover, the book is far away from the tradition of Richard Stevens' &#34;Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment&#34;. In contrast to APUE, which truly enlightens the reader with all sorts of historical, portability, and background information, Teer's book is not much more than a Solaris API description. <br /> <br />Many of the examples in it will not work unmodified on Linux, BSD, or other platforms. It will thus not be of much help to a novice Unix programmer unless he actually wants to write Solaris-only programs - not a common scenario in the Unix/POSIX world. But a more experienced programmer can just use the Solaris manual pages to get most of the information contained in the book. <br /> <br />Also the book contains one of the most stupid code examples I have ever seen: an snprintf() emulation that works by calling vsprintf() first, then checking its return value to see if the buffer size was large enough, possibly exiting with an error message: <br /> <br />int snprintf (char *buf, size_t n, const char *fmt, ...) { [...] <br />len = vsprintf (buf, fmt, ap); [...] <br />if (len &#62;= n) <br />    err_quit (&#34;snprintf: \&#34;%s\&#34; caused a buffer overflow&#34;, fmt); <br /> <br />But when such an overflow is actually exploited on the stack by an attacker, vsprintf() may not return at all, rendering the check useless. The code thus gives a false impression of security. This might be regarded even more dangerous than code that does not perform overflow checks at all, especially in the context of a book. <br /> <br />I have to admit that I did not look at too many examples, but I would recommend to be cautious with the book until somebody has verified that this is the only fundamental security error in its code.	2004-10-14
US	20641627	R10C37EIPXAQXH	0465001769	492085239	What Liberal Media?: The Truth About Bias and the News	Books	4	12	26	N	N	Pointing out the elephant in the room	The myth of \\"liberal media bias\\" is one of the most useful propaganda tactics that conservatives have. However, as Alterman indicates early in the book, even they know that it is false. Unless they were irrational, they would *have* to know that it is false, just as, aside from a few religious hysterics, Creationism & \\"Intelligent Design\\" proponents *have* to know that the actual scientific evidence overwhelmingly refutes their claims. However, they don't care. Their favored interpretation of their favored translation of their favored religious book says \\"God did it,\\" and that's that, for them. To a totally unwarranted degree, though, they are allowed to get away with espousing things that are obviously false (of course, only a \\"god-hater\\" would say that is due to the USA's deeply-ingrained pro-Christian bias).    Alterman does an excellent job of dissecting the myth about \\"liberal media bias,' although it does at times get quite dry, as has been noted. Even so, it is necessary that the information be presented. Quote after quote after quote from conservatives themselves provide a mind-boggling display demonstrating the elementary reality that conservatism in practice is nothing more than a rationalization for greed, malice, and deceit. One of my favorites is from \\"Joseph Farah, a columnist for Worldnet,\\" who \\"warned his readers in October 2002, 'The Democrats--far too many of them--are evil, pure ans simple. They have no redeeming social value. They are outright traitors themselves or apologists for treasonous behavior. They are enemies of the American people and the American way of life.'\\" The spin doctors who spout the \\"Rush is an entertainer\\" nonsense might try to do the same with Farah, but it is clear enough that Farah, Limbaugh, et al. are in fact thoroughly unprincipled political propagandists. Comments like Farah's are quite common from conservatives. I see plenty of that sort of thing in the supposedly \\"liberal\\" local daily newspaper. In common with the broadcast media, this newspaper displays a glaringly obvious double standard where conservatives and everybody else are concerned. Conservatives are allowed to spout inflammatory and obviously malicious bilge, whereas everybody else is supposed to be \\"responsible\\" and not say nasty things.    Certain events occurring after this book was published are relevant to the subject.    First, all the hysteria over CBS's use of documents relating to Dubya's National Guard \\"service\\" has obscured the unpleasant reality that the *content* of the documents has been verified. The supposedly biased \\"liberal\\" media has barely been able to bring itself to mention that.    Second, the Sinclair network is demanding that its stations preempt their schedules to broadcast a particularly crude piece of anti-Kerry propaganda.    Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the conservative bias of Fox News always has been and still is painfully obvious. It is, in effect, a propaganda arm of the Republican Party.    I concluded years ago that conservatives don't just use the \\"liberal media bias\\" Big Lie because it is useful and they can get away with it. They use it because they are *infuriated* by the very existence of non-conservative opinions and actions. Their \\"narcissistic self-pity\\" drives them to treat any sort of disagreement or, heaven forfend!, opposition as a heinous affront, thereby inevitably creating a very real \\"us or them\\" situation in which this country simply is not big enough for conservatives and for self-respecting non-conservatives. I only gave the book four stars because Alterman seems too inclined to give conservatives credit for some sort of warped \\"sincerity.\\" The local \\"liberal\\" daily does the same thing. Time after time after time, they whimper about the \\"sincere religious beliefs\\" of Creationists, homophobes, etc., as though religious belief could possibly justify bigotry!    All in all, though, not a perfect book, but a useful and valuable one.	2004-10-13

John R. Kohlenberger III and James A. Swanson took on this task and have made several improvements.  The first thing they did was to fix several minor errors in previous versions.  Then they included words that were italicized in the Cambridge King James Version.  This is important because these represent words that were not in the original text but were supplied in translation to help the reader understand the text.  Finally, they computer verified the accuracy of the text.  Because of this they state that this is the most accurate Strong's concordance to ever be published.<br /><br />Really nice features include sensitivity to translational problems such as the need to sometimes use multiple words to translate a single word because the destination language doesn't contain a similar word.  Because of this problem these multiple words are included as a set and matched against the Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek word.<br /><br />The Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek dictionaries have also been updated from previous editions to reflect current Biblical scholarship.  At the back of the book are some additional reference materials that are pretty unusual for a concordance.  These materials include things like a Hebrew calendar, sacred days listing, weights and measures information, and a harmony of the gospels.<br /><br />Still the best King James concordance available and the best value for your money The Strongest Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible is highly recommended.<br /><br />I've read some of the reviews here that indicate problems with this concordance including the one that complains that it does not have the reference to Luke in Philemon 1:24.  Please take the time to note that this is a concordance of the King James Version and so it says Lucas and not Luke in that passage, etc.	2004-10-10

Dannion Brinkley writes an extremely compelling book on the NDE (near death experience). This is the fellow who got struck by lightening and was clinically dead for 28 minutes before being revived, met by a \\"Spirit Being\\" both times he died. His interactions with Dr. Raymond Moody, who studies NDE's, make for excellent reading. He also comments on accounts of others who've died & come back to talk about it. (Dannion can speak with authority on this subject, having experienced it first-hand!)<br /><br />One of the most interesting things are the predictions given in the book, the \\"Boxes of Knowledge.\\" Since it was written in 1994, many of them couldn't be verified as accurate. I mean, how do we know he really had these visions back in 1975. Maybe he conveniently remembered certain things after they happened and pretended to predict them.<br /><br />In any case, this isn't the major thrust of the book, but I'll briefly touch on it: He mentioned (in his book, which, let me emphasize again, was written in 1994) that he sees people flooding over the boarders from South America by 2000 due to civil wars, socialism, and a breakdown of the Mexican economy. These problems and the resulting flood of Hispanic immigrants, both legal and illegal aliens, have all happened to some extent as predicted (immigration being a major political issue nowadays). However, his prediction that Egypt would collapse as a democracy by 1997 seems to not have happened. This nation is considered to be a moderate Arab nation to this day. No one likes a false prophet, so it's a good thing he mentions that the \\"Beings of Light\\" (angels) told him that these predictions weren't definite, that \\"The flow of human events can be changed.\\"<br /><br />Dannion, however, does good: He claims the main point of these predictions was that we must make a change. True!<br /><br />The many accounts of his ability to read other peoples' minds, however, MUST NOT be taken lightly, for there is NO rebuttal that I could find on the Internet of his allegations, and I did search deeply. Thus, neither his predictions nor his books should be discounted offhand: He seems like an authentic psychic, a gift he says he gained from his NDE.<br /><br />In a later book, \\"At Peace in the Light,\\" Brinkley says his mission is to go to hospices and help with the dying process to let these people know that what they're about to face isn't scary. He tells them his story, assuring them they'll have a life review, asking them to do good so they won't feel regret.<br /><br />However, his main point in this book is to simply tell people what happened to him, and to share his vision for making these healing \\"centers\\" (aided by education in electronics and math in classes during his visions). The purpose of the centers is to let people attain their higher self, help people forgive others, and do good, for he claims that in the life review where your life flashes before your eyes, you get to feel the pain or pleasure you've caused others, and even the pain and suffering or pleasure that results from THEIR actions, downstream, so to speak.<br /><br />This is the authentic, redeeming quality of the book; he brilliantly captures the law of sowing and reaping. (Plus all those angels and visions don't hurt either!)<br /><br />Brinkley mentions religion & God in passing, citing, in particular, experiences of people in the Bible that may have been near NDE's. His theme of doing good for others because we're all connected and his message of people taking responsibility or being \\"in control of their lives through God\\" (page 60) is certainly in line with mainstream Judeo-Christian philosophy. However, there are nagging omissions that are as wide as a canyon!<br /><br />On page 202, for example, he says there exist many paths to righteousness, instead of Jesus as the only way. Yet, he doesn't address Jesus' role. He makes absolutely NO mention of Hell, even though it's clearly a topic about which Jesus spoke numeroustimes. Is there a hell? He doesn't say.<br /><br />Lastly, his plans for the stress reduction \\"centers\\" worries me: On page 60, he mentions one of these rooms has a bed with \\"musical components\\" to help a person relax deeply enough to leave his body. This is strictly forbidden by the Bible. See e.g., Ex. 22:18 & Lev. 19:26. My review is only of this particular book, but it must be taken in context with recent actions by Mr. Brinkley: More recently, he's featured on programs in which he assists people in contacting dead relatives. Being a \\"necromancer,\\" one who talks with the dead to predict the future or doing sorcery or magic, is also Biblically forbidden: Deut. 18:11. Could the \\"Beings of Light\\" be fallen angels, demons masquerading as God`s Holy Angels? \\"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.\\" II Cor. 11:14-15<br /><br />Bottom line? I have pressing concerns about possible departure from or omission of certain truths that Judeo-Christian readers, such as myself, may hold true. For this reason I can't give it five stars, but I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT, for there is much good in this, if the reader will read with a critical eye.

Some of it brought tears to my eyes.  I haven't verified everything in the CD, but President Clinton's commentary on events in his life ring true with the newspaper reports and government reports I have been able to find even if he did polish his version in a certain Clintonesque way.  I don't doubt that there are people who have trashed this because of party policy, but if you really give this book (CD) a chance you might find that the character is as familiar as what you may see in your mirror.  I think it is as well written as Bragg's \\"All Over But The Shoutin'\\", and has similar charm to other Southern writers I have read.   <br /> <br />I felt the pain of loss and betrayal as he read certain words.  I was not proud of the person whose story I was hearing and who brought about Monica-gate, and I thought his conduct with the intern was disgraceful.  I felt he reported his behavior during this scandal fairly if sparingly even to the point of admitting his lying.  Still Clinton's lies did not put a damper on the US economy during that time or cause any global catastrophe, so the upshot is that his indisgressions were little more that a media frenzy (and some political bark with little if any bite). <br /> <br />The president's account of his time in DC brought the tears.  What the politics did (and are doing) to our country is disgraceful.  The only antidote is a heck of a lot of education for everyone.  Get yourself educated, get involved, and help start the revolution that Thomas Jefferson recommended so many years ago before it is too late.	2004-10-07
US	16939388	R2EX9F10LI4TZN	1840462639	833025191	Introducing Time	Books	5	13	23	N	N	Proof that "Time" is interpretive, thus not understandable--	I purchased this book because I hoped to gain a deep or profound insight about Time from educated, intellectual minds.  And while I did in fact achieve this goal, it was not thru the manner that I expected. <br /> <br />I support the entire \\"Introducing...\\" series by Totem because their illustrations along with genuine, serious educational content make the books highly appealing, attractive and inspiring.  And this one was no exception -- in terms of doing its best to present, primarily chronologically, what informed minds from involved and associated fields had to say, or present as theory, about \\"Time.\\"  But -- and this is meant to have a dramatic impact -- BUT...  it was through reading what these thinkers and scholars had to say about time that verified to me that nobody knows what it is.  Which is a good thing; a great thing!  To me this means that a little boy or girl living out in the middle of nowhere has just as much right -- and is equally \\"correct\\" -- in whatever they feel or suppose \\"time\\" is.  After reading this book, I realized that nobody can 'know' what Time is, but rather they attempt to define it in ways, that when one looks at it clearly, should come to see as solely based on the way 'time' is measured.  Again, time is not definable; it is open to interpretaion; one must be wary of definitions that purport to define, but really do nothing more than present notions based upon how 'time' is measured.  A person who sees \\"time\\" as seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years is no more correct than a person who experiences time as an independent, deeply-personal intuitive experience. <br /> <br />The best part of the book is the brief area where Einstein's theories of relativity are introduced.

US	51990995	R3ABUWF3CIDDWY	0786713666	234440150	In Search of the Greatest Golf Swing: Chasing the Legend of Mike Austin, the Man Who Launched the World's Longest Drive and Taught Me to Hit Like a Pro	Books	5	19	19	N	N	A Happy Coincidence	This book is a delight on such a number of levels it is difficult to decide where to place the emphasis. It really should be in the library of every golfer, at least those that read more than simply golf instruction manuals, although this book is a little bit of that too, which I will get to.  <br /> <br />It is first, a fascinating short bio about Mike Austin, a professional tour player in the 1930's, 40's, 50's, and later, who possessed one of the more incredible swings in golfing annals. What spices the book though, is that Austin was also truly bigger than life. Some of the stories about him are enough to have caused some doubt even in the author, Phil Reed's,  mind, that is until he verified many of them. In his time Austin hung out with celebrities (Errol Flynn among others), was a boxer, an actor, a linguist, and had a doctorate in kinesiology and so on. The stories about him are legend and the book is richly supplied with them. <br /> <br />Austin could hit the ball 350 yards in his 60's and 70's. He actually hit it 515 yards at age 64, and it was in a sanctioned PGA tournament, not a long drive competition, and not with the modern technology that the pros use today. This distance is about 200 yards father than Tiger Woods averages. <br />  <br />One of several interesting characters in the book is a fellow by the name of Danny Shauger. Danny is a teaching professional in the Studio City area of LA, and was (is) more or less Austin's protg. He worked with Austin for years parsing out his swing and reducing it to a description of its basic parts that an average golfer could understand, if he worked on it. Danny, I was to personally find out, is a bit of a Mike Austin himself, but that is another story. <br /> <br />On yet another level, Phil Reed's book is a memoir of sorts about the author's occasional feelings of inferiority around other certain types of guys. You know the type, guys who are natural athletes or otherwise bigger than life. This is an admission that many men could make,most probably, but very few do and I admire Reed for his courage. <br /> <br />Anyway, by happy coincidence I picked Reed's book up this summer while browsing a book store for some reading to take on a vacation I badly needed but hadn't yet planned in any detail. I say happy coincidence, because at that point I had never even heard of Austin, described in the book as a generally irascible Scotsman. Austin by the way is 94 now, and although suffering from the debilitation of a stroke still occasionally teaches, albeit from an armchair. He also apparently remains, even in old age, a bit angry and a lot outspoken, but apparently a genius in general, and of the golf swing in particular.  <br /> <br />A week or so after I first read Reed's book,  I called Danny Shauger on an impulse to see if he could work with me, at least on the rudiments of Austin's swing, if I flew out to LA. As I said, I needed a vacation anyway. Danny had the time and so off I went, with no small amount of skepticism about what I would find.   <br /> <br />What I found was incredible. I ended up working with Danny for a solid week. In my experience, Danny is light years beyond anyone teaching the golf swing today. Not just in his knowledge of the Austin swing but in his intensity and concern for his students. Danny himself is about 64 and I witnessed him hitting ball after ball, 350 yards. The distances I myself was hitting the ball after several days of Danny's intense tutelage are unbelievable to me (a 62 year old duffer). Perhaps  I can say it best though by admitting I am no longer at all impressed by the distances a professional golfer can hit an iron shot because I was doing it myself within a couple of days of starting work with Danny. <br /> <br />Reed's book itself briefly describes the Austin swing, so does Danny's recent book; \\"The Mike Austin Method, How to Kill the Ball\\".  But Danny's book is a thorough instructional manual on the Austin swing. As with anygolf instruction though, this swing will take some real work on the part of the golfer, and probably months to become consistently ingrained in his muscle memory.  Working directly with Danny was a definite short cut. <br /> <br />PS: Don't think \\"Natural Golf\\" here, because it isn't anything like that somewhat inelegant, in appearance at least, swing. Austin's swing is definitely different, beautifully smooth, quite effortless and highly effective. Except to the trained eye, it is visually indistinguishable from the standard PGA swing, and prettier than most. <br /> <br />I guess you can tell I liked this book.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-01

Certainly it is history not forgotten but repeated none-the-less in sweeping rehearsals across 7,000 years. Edwin Black brings people to life with crisp reality, from our goose bump inspiring contemporaries struggling to keep the peace, like Lt. Col. Chris Hughes, to Genghis Khan, whose only interest was retaliation and retribution which he meted out with gruesome methodical dispatch. Iraq's history is that not only of those who began life there, but often of others who sometimes accidentally and sometimes deliberately became entangled there--sometimes as a cross roads and sometimes as a destination. Award winning author Edwin Black brings an exacting demand for verified and original source materials -- indisputable facts -- together with the richness, complexity and idiosyncrasies of the major players into a comprehensible and well founded look at what it is that we are doing in Iraq today, within a 7,000 year understanding. Both the scope and detail combined to make this a very special experience. What better way to prepare for thoughtful consideration of our nation's future relations and role in Iraq?	2004-09-30

The reviewer, Nemesis (Washington D.C.), demonstrates a rather appalling lack of knowledge of the current state of cross-cultural research. The original studies of Geert Hofstede were in fact carried out in English within the IBM Corporation, as Hofstede was an IBM employee at the time. However, since then a considerable number of studies have been completed, with the survey administered in English and in local languages, demonstrating the usefulness and consistency of Hofstede's cultural value constructs. Most responsible cross-cultural research today that uses surveys is carried out with data collection in local languages. The reader is referred, for example, to the extensive body of work on values across cultures based upon the Shalom Schwartz value survey. You can look it up.<br /><br />In the social sciences, of which business is one, a theory is a model or framework for understanding phenomena. The term generally is taken to mean a framework derived from a set of basic principles capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category in a system. Humans construct theories in order to explain, predict and master phenomena (e.g. inanimate things, events, or the behaviour of animals). In many instances, it is seen to be a model of reality. A theory makes generalizations about observations and consists of an interrelated, coherent set of ideas. A theory has to be something that is in some way testable; for example, one can theorize that businesses progress from local to international markets by always implementing a certain set of processes in a fixed order. Then the process of internationalization of businesses is studied, and the theory is confirmed or revised in a continuous feedback system.<br /><br />According to Stephen Hawking, a physicist, in A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, \\"a theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations.\\" He goes on to state...\\"Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory. On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory.\\" This also applies to business theories, including Hofstede's, from which one can make definite predictions that have been verified. Theories are not facts, but tools.large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations.\\" He goes on to state...\\"Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; you can never prove it.

Based on fully developed, productive sub-systems (biologic systems, weather systems, solar systems, ecologic, geologic, social, etc.) within the universe's Natural Macrosystem currently in-place and their successful processing of input into meaningful, measurable output, it can be categorically demonstrated that this is the way it happened to happen, NOT was \\"supposed\\" to happen, both intra-system and inter-system for each and all, separately and in toto; <br /> <br />6. EVERY ONE of these presently observed and tested sub-systems and ALL their attendant essential micro-systems and their successful interplay to accomplish measurable results, can be demonstrated to have developed naturally in the same \\"unsupposed\\" fashion to arrive where they are today as a survivable, stand-alone fitting component as well as fully incorporatable as non-superfluous into the universe's Natural Macrosystem; <br /> <br />5. There was a time when NONE of these presently operative and integrative sub-systems existed in its own right either due to lack of necessity or opportunity or both, yet it can be demonstrated as scientific utmost probability that at some point ALL came into being in the universe's Natural Macrosystem due to some eventual overarching necessity AND opportunity (each is minimally required but insufficient condition for development from non-existence to existence); <br /> <br />4. Specifically, there was a time when Eyesight was unnecessary or non-opportune among living entities. Life developed fine without it. Yet at some point ALL Eyesight began to come into being in an environment that had to create its own necessity AND opportunity for the phenomenon, where before there was ABSOLUTELY NONE WHATSOEVER. It wasn't \\"supposed\\" to happen; it can be demonstrated by scientific method that it just happened to happen when completely uncalled for; <br /> <br />3. There was a time when there were no micro-systems, no sub-systems that are observed today, such as the specific visual system of organisms: brain, necessary connections, neural pathways, transmitters, electrical energy, blood/tissue support, optic nerve and all minimal required components of the eye itself and its housing (socketing, head vs. foot placement for optimal optics and observation, skull accomodations to welcome the newcoming device, esthetics, lid & lash & accretional browbone  protection, cleansing apparatus: tears, sand, etc.) operating in cumulatively increasing concert and competency even for \\"primitive eyesight\\". Yet, though not \\"supposed\\" to happen, it can be verified by scientific proof testing that at some point it happened to happen as the requisite preconditions of opportunity and necessity consummated a partnership. Somehow non-eye body parts of the organism migrated from prior utilitarian functionality and maturation to generate daughter material and previously undesired, unnecessary, nonopportune subsystems with their requisite microsystems into an entirely new mechanism that wasn't \\"supposed\\" to, but happened to benefit the organism, so that whereas sight was once nil in the animal kingdom, sightlessness is now the exception of rarity; <br /> <br />2. There was a time when there was only the universe's Natural Macrosystem, perhaps in proto-development staging without any subsystem or any systemization toward anything, let alone evolution, selection, adaptation, survivability, organic necessity or opportunity. It wasn't \\"supposed\\" to happen, but it can be validated via scientific verifiability that it just happened as brute fact by brute force from brute_____(you fill in the blank). <br /> <br />1. There was a time (pre-time?) when there was no Natural Macrosystem at all. But it can be demonstrated by the rigors of lab & in-the-field tangible science that it naturally developed by the simultaneous/spontaneous development of both necessity AND opportunity, without which nothing, macro or micro,would happen or be. Unless, allowing for the remote possibility under the Intelligent Design scenario, it was supposed to happen all along, from Beginning, throughout Continuum, to now to the future. <br /> <br />Why didn't the writers address the issue of Pre-existing operating systemization in their exposition of evolutionary theory contra Intelligent Design? The advantage of ID is that issue is fully taken into account, but omitted in this critique.      <br /> <br />	2004-09-29

I especially liked the brief section about Guatemala that is found within the larger section on Iran-Contra.  Alterman recounts the facts often overlooked by so many:  That in 1954 the CIA overthrew the democratically-elected Arbenz government, installed a dictator, and for decades thereafter supported dictators who killed 200,000 Guatemalan civilians. He even briefly mentions that the CIA overthrow resulted in major-league blowback in the form of radicalizing Dr. Ernesto Guevara, who was in Guatemala in 1954 and witnessed the overthrow, and as a result came to believe that only armed revolution could help the poor.    The irony of course is that those who are currently most vociferous about installing democracy in Iraq were those who had no problem with the U.S. support in the 1980s of Guatemalan dictators who directed the genocide of the Mayan Indians.  It is the same cast of characters-- with Cheney leading the pack.    Alterman also impressed me in the Guatemalan subsection of his book with his reluctance to overstate.  Alterman states that \\"one\\" of the reasons the CIA overthrew the Arbenz government was to please the United Fruit Company, which opposed Arbenz's economic policies.  Well, that really was the main reason.  United Fruit Company complained to two of its former lawyers who were high up in the U.S. government--the Dulles boys, John Foster who was Secretary of State, and Allen who was the head of the CIA.  The result was quite helpful to the United Fruit Company.    The second area where Alterman pulls back a little is where he comments that because so many records are still being kept secret by the U.S. government, we don't know, beyond some verified CIA involvement, the extent to which the U.S. was complicit in the mass killings of tens of thousand of Mayans in the 1980s.Well, again, we do know a lot based on Department of Defense memoranda, State Department cables and CIA documents, which have been secured in part through the Freedom of Information Act.  And the conclusion is not pretty.  Of course the U.S. officials in the Reagan/Bush administrations knew about the butchery and yet continued to fund and train the butchers.     Alterman has convinced me of his evenhandedness.  His incisiveness is wonderful to read.	2004-09-29

Griffin, and the others he calls \\"critics\\", pose possible theories of a governmental wide conspiracy that includes the FAA, FBI, CIA, NMCC, NORAD, Secret Service, the presidential cabinet, WTC workers, NYC police, military personnel, Pentagon officials, TV commentator Barbara Olsen (who was listed as a passenger on Flight 77) and her husband Solicitor General Ted Olsen, eyewitnesses, fighter pilots launched from Air Force Bases after the attacks, the media, the 9/11 Commission, Osama bin Laden, Congress and the President of the United States (just to name a few).  Griffin in the end intimates the ultimate question:  Did President Bush help plan the 9/11 terrorist attack?         Whether you are a believer of a possible 9/11 conspiracy or not, one should look no further of the validity of David Griffin's book than in the introduction.  Griffin writes, \\"And, although I have repeated only evidence that seemed credible to me, I have not independently verified the accuracy of this evidence.  As the reader will see, this evidence is so extensive and of such a nature that no individual -- especially no individual with very limited time and resources -- could check out its accuracy.\\"    Say what you want about President Bush, but I do think the president deserves at least an effort from his pundits to \\"independently verify the accuracy\\" when intimating he is a serial killer 3,000 times over.      One of my personal favorites in a book filled with twisted facts is the way Griffin and the other \\"critics\\" make the claim one must discount eyewitness accounts of flight 77 (which flew into the Pentagon).  Griffin and the \\"critics\\" claim it wasn't a hijacked airliner, as we've been told, but a missile launched by the U.S. intentionally intothe Pentagon.  To explain why he thinks people mistakenly say they saw a plane headed for the Pentagon, he comes up with a theory called, \\"Social Psychology of Perception and Memory\\".  Basically he says witnesses understandably would think they saw an airliner overhead because that's what the person would expect to see.  In reality, they actually saw a missile shot by our own government, even though their testimony says otherwise.  This is unbiased?      Right.  I thought I saw my dog sifting through the trash last night but come to find out it was actually the Easter Bunny.    How about how Griffin and the \\"critics\\" defend Mohommed Atta's (identified as the ringleader in America by the 9/11 Commission) trip to Las Vegas with fellow conspirators?  Griffin argues that stories of Atta and the others behavior in Vegas doesn't add up.  \\"...they drank alcohol, gambled and frequented strip clubs and had lap dances performed on them.  Is this something that true believers would do shortly before going on a suicide mission to meet their maker?\\"    Huh?      Yes, Mr. Griffin, I do think these men were capable of having a woman bump and grind them while downing a shot of Wild Turkey.  According to Griffin and the \\"critics\\", my way of thinking is obviously irrational.  I mean, how could someone plotting to destroy the WTC have a beer?  That's crazy talk.      I would think a book of this importance and weight would call for a little more than 256 pages.  He's admitted he didn't verify facts (who has the time for that?) and later, he writes that two of the main \\"critics\\", Nafeer Mosaddeq Ahmed and Thierry Meyssan, say their own work does not present a \\"conclusive case\\" and \\"cannot be taken as the definitive truth\\", respectively.    I was asked to read this book with an open mind.  I did.  I hope everyone else will as well.	2004-09-24

Bush, the Media, and the Truth	Books	3	12	15	N	Y	Good record, boring read	The first thing that should be said about this book is that it's really thin on spin. What it accomplishes is outing many out and out Bush administration lies. Spin is when you're selling an old couch that your dog used to lie on and call it \\"shabby chic\\". Most of what's here are lies. The tax relief plan paid for itself? That's not spin, that's taking something that's not at all true and saying it's fact. Saddam and Osama? No evidence, but for months it was the administration's war gospel. There's no spin where no shred of truth ever stood. <br /> <br />So, about the book. I'll tell you straight up: It's boring. Without much insight, the book walks through the different scandals of the presidency and describes how facts are altered as a means for saving face and never admitting fault or defeat. Starting with the tainted election and working to a point I can't stay awake to read about, they're all there. <br /> <br />What's missing? Analysis and insight. This book is a fact checker's delight. The sources are verified and the twists on said sources are identified. I expected that in this book, but I also craved commentary and insight that was just absent. I'll give the authors their due respect for uncovering subject matter that was intentionally shrouded, but their impartial nature turns eloquence to evidence, and really detracts from what could have been a vindictive, poignant read for an election year. <br /> <br />One part that earned these authors my stingy stars was their steadily pointed finger at a lazy lazy press corps. It's clearly an issue with dedication of resources, but the press really doesn't do anything to dig into the statements that politicians make unless someone outside of the press goes to them with proof of intentional deceit. In the book, this is noted everywhere it's appropriate, and I'm scared to say that the problem is likely far worse than the book could express. <br /> <br />Regardless, this book is not the flashy scandalous read I hopedit would be. It's an awesome reference, however, and will likely be used to source data for volumes upon volumes of (hopefully) more compelling future efforts.	2004-09-23

I got exactly that.  It wasn't a real page turner though.  In fact, I had to force myself to continue reading it about half way through.   <br />Mrs Brodie seems to have done a lot of research and presents it pretty well.  There were a couple of instances where I thought she was reaching a bit, but she indicated herself that these instances were only theories, or possibilites, so in that regard I have to give her a lot of credit.  These instances were also very trivial matters, in my opinion.  The more substantial claims, such as the \\"translation\\" of the plates, and the polygamy can be verified through LDS sources, and are much more damaging to the church's credibility than this book could ever be. <br />In fairness, I attempted to read \\"No Ma'am, that's not history\\" by Hugh Nibley.  I say \\"attempted\\", because like most apologists, Mr Nibley seems to dance around issues rather than addressing them directly.  I got tired of waiting for him to make a point and quit reading. <br />In conclusion, if you want to learn about Joseph Smith, and read a very credible explaination for the circumstances regarding the foundation of the LDS church, read this book.	2004-09-22

Many times he went back to interview the witnesses a second or third time to clarify facts. All the facts are documented with names, locations, details and some re-enactments.

Mr. Coleman includes only verified facts, no undocumented evidence is precluded as the \\"truth\\". There are no allusions made to the paranormal as the \\"answer\\" and only answer, leaving no other options as some writers utilize. If Mr. Coleman found a resolution to the case, he resolves it also for the reader. I have found other writters will \\"leave it open\\" as to suggest again paranormal tendencies and there are no answers. A very good read, with physically researched facts.	2004-09-22

Unfortunately this book is marred by a heavy-handed \\"I know all the inner work\\" approach, all the more troubling when we consider that it was written decades before Hall became a Mason. Hall asserts facts about ancient Egypt that cannot be verified by evidence. However, this book represents a distinct philosophy of Masonry that has been very influential in the United States and should not be overlooked by completists or those particularly attracted to trascendentalist / magical interpretations of the Craft. Please bear in mind, though, that esoteric Masons are the first to tell you how important real initiation into the tradition is. That being the case, it would have to be the most supreme coincidence if Hall as someone who had never experienced the degrees other than by reading copies of them, had come to grasp their absolute essence (as suggested by other reviewers here). Also, I would like to think the the finest interpretations of Freemasonry would not rely on fabribated historical information, such as many of the \\"Egyptian\\" practices mentioned throughout the text and depicted in the illustrations, for example, in the frontispiece.	2004-09-12

It's hard to get full and you know you that you really shouldn't finish the whole dozen. But you do.  (The author uses an analogy with jellybeans, but I don't care for sugar in that density.)<br /><br />The author, Wendy Northcutt, recognized this pitfall, and even stated \\"These stories aren't meant to be read all at once.\\" But putting this collection of tales on the table top proves harder than expected. . .just one more, you think, then another, and well, you see how it goes.<br /><br />Ms. Northcutt prefaces this collection of tales-some true and verified; some unverified submissions; some personal accounts; and, for fun, some relevant urban legend-with a synopsis of Darwin's somehow still controversial \\"theory\\" of evolution (when will we collectively abandon the notion that evolution is a theory; how the Internet shaped her work in collecting and verifying submissions for the Darwin Awards; and the criteria for determining the winners of this dubious honor.<br /><br />Some may consider Ms. Northcutt's rather biting humor mean-spirited and cruel. Others find great humor at these mostly fatal tales marked chiefly by stupidity---those a measure of these doomed souls no doubt were ignorant of the potentially lethal consequences of their actions.<br /><br />Regardless, \\"The Darwin Awards\\" might find a home in a beach house, on a book case in the basement, or even a treehouse.

The reason this is so is because over 60 years ago, a very similar situation occurred in World War II.   <br /> <br />     If anyone is interested in a historical precedent to John Kerry's apparent behavior, the book \\"Attack on Yamamoto\\", by Carroll Glines, offers a good example (although I am sure there are many others).  This book documents not only one of the most historic aerial interceptions ever to occur, but also the apparent efforts of fighter pilot Thomas Lanphier to falsify records and perform other deceitful acts in order to claim official credit for shooting down the legendary Japanese admiral who planned the Pearl Harbor attacks, and thus assist his own anticipated post-war political career.   <br /> <br />     Mr. Lanphier claimed to have personally shot down the bomber carrying Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and without soliciting any input from others involved in the mission, he himself wrote and submitted the official military documentation attesting to that version of events.  When the person who most likely actually did shoot down Yamamoto, Rex Barber, attempted to determine the truth and bring to light his own version of events, Mr. Lanphier would point to the \\"official records\\" as the only trustworthy source of information on this landmark event in military history.  Subsequent visits to the wreckage of the bomber at the location of the shootdown have verified Mr. Barber's account and contradicted Lanphier's version. <br /> <br />     The evidence is now overwhelming that in order to paint himself as the hero in this epic shootdown, Mr. Lanphier falsified the official records, and transmitted to newspapers and other media a fraudulent version of events.  He performed these acts because he had an overpowering ambition to someday become the President of the United States, and assumed that being known as \\"The War Hero Who Shot Down Yamamoto\\" might enable him to ultimately achieve that goal. <br /> <br />     Among other relevant issues, the Yamamoto shootdown controversy points out the potential problems that can occur with \\"official\\" military documentation.  Because these records are often the only reference materials for a given military action, they tend to be trusted without question.  However, the defensive words of the Kerry campaign, issued to counter the evidence presented in \\"Unfit for Command\\", echo those of Thomas Lanphier himself almost verbatim, and should arouse suspicion in any American who is honestly seeking the truth.	2004-09-08

The clarification of some of the events that Kerry has put forth were solidly refuted using many eyewitness accounts.  The only way I would be convinced that Kerry's version was infact the true one would be to review the military file that to date he has kept a closely gaurded secret.  Since I have started the book two of the claims have been verified by the Kerry campaign (cambodia christmas and first purple heart) and I am sure that one by one the allegations will prove more and more true.  I say don't run on the horse if you know the horse has a lame leg.....but what domestic record does he have except anti-war protester and anti-military ultra liberal.   <br />Read the book and decide for yourself.	2004-09-07

I'm delighted to see that it is still available, since I recently loaned my copy to my teenaged son, who was seeking an accessible translation of the I Ching. I was loath to let it leave the house until I verified that it could be replaced at Amazon.  <br /> <br />The other reviewer is correct that the introduction is rather short for someone not already familiar with the I Ching (or at least divination systems in general), but it is sufficient to allow the user to dive right in. Each hexagram is given interpretations in modern English for the three critical areas of life that three quarters of all divination is done: \\"artha\\" (work), \\"kama\\" (love), and \\"moksha\\" (spirituality). Here's my only complaint then, for one on health would have covered that last quarter! <br /> <br />Despite the use of the three Sanscrit terms, the book is faithful to the Chinese cultural context of the I Ching and neither talks down to nor over the head of the reader. Anyone over the age of 14 should be able to read and use this book with success, though those under 30 may refuse to believe some of the practical but not-much-fun advice the oracle will dispense. It's like talking to a reasonably hip Chinese American grandfather. But I'll stop now, before I wax on and wax off too much....	2004-09-02

You will find that this Gospel commentary is at least equal to if not superior to anything written to date on this subject.<br /><br />There are a number of things that make this work especially qualified to represent the true teachings of Jesus the Christ.<br />(a)The author Himself actually lived the life described in these gospels- Paramahansa Yogananda was a modern Christ in every regard. If one cannot see this in the Second Coming book, this fact can be further verified through a couple of more years study of the Masters life and other teachings. Plus there are still a few living witnesses to His divine stature.<br />(b)Yogananda goes far beyond other academics/clergy and theologians. he not only gives a spiritually potent and convincing explanation of Jesus teachings, but also the full and clearest methodology on how to reach that high state of self-realization. He takes you on the actual journey and explains every step of the way. You would not get more or better instruction even if you were in the presence of another physical teacher.<br />(c)the proof and value of the spiritual instruction in the second coming have already been effectively verified by Yogananda's divine lineage and many successor disciples-it works!<br />(d)His approach that he is not attempting to prove the authenticity and factualness of the Early Gospels [see Page 69] is very telling of His foresight and wisdom. This very area, is where many embarrassed and presumptuous previous writers made their first mistake. Assuming that everything in writing is the unadulterated \\"word of God.\\" This caution alone sets him apart and speaks to his humility.<br />(e)He uses the mystical path of Yoga Sciences and Vedic spiritual wisdom as the background to share with us the inner/fuller meanings and purposes of Jesus the Christ's teachings and mission. Whereas various other commenters on these same documents have been attempting to show the origins of many Gospel passages as originating in Buddhistic and Egyptian traditions.<br />(f)The value and veracity of a true revelatory spiritual message rests in part upon its useful and original ideas for the spiritual seeker. Here Yogananda gives us a cornucopia of valuable and refreshingly original approaches to many of the heretofore mysteries of the bible. He fills in a lot of the blanks that were left when other writers on these subjects attempted to come up with similar concepts.<br />One can clearly see herein the difference between previous \\"attempts\\" to explain subtle matters and Yogananda's finished product.<br />(g) And above all, the author avoids the greatest of all pitfalls so many others got tripped up on - the true meaning of Christ's second coming. You will find in the gospels that the reason why JEsus says \\"no man can know the day or the hour of his return\\" , is simply because he will not be making a public earth shaking appearance. His second coming occurs in the lives of those who become one with Him or God and is happening to a few souls continually. All others who have attempted to claim the other idea of a public return have ended up looking like fools and frauds. They were all lost in popular belief systems. PY instead supports his universal Christ Consciousness theory with ample evidence and conviction. Freeing all seekers and faithful from the blind opportunism that has victimized them in the past by the popular doomsday Jesus return concepts. It gives credit to this Gurus way ofreturning the power from bad leaders to the individual devotee. It further demonstrates how obedience to the Master results in the greatest freedom and god-realization for all who make the effort using the right means. Then one becomes truly free.<br /><br />This work seems to truly represent the Jesus of Judean times. Before time, men and politics distorted and/or lost so much of the beautiful wisdom that Jesus taught back then. And some that was kept so secretive, as was required in the mystical customs of old.<br /><br />It is truly fitting that after the attempts of so many other well meaning but ineffectual claims of other prophets who claimed credit for restoring Jesus true teachings, it is a prophet from India [where Jesus spent almost half of his life] who is able to finally reveal the true light of that ancient and holy teaching. A light that has already given new hope to millions of spiritual seekers around the globe for the last hundred or so years.<br /><br />This book tells us about some of Jesus amazing connections with India that have been verified through history.<br />It goes into great detail on spiritual practice and healing, the Master -Disciple relationship as the door to heaven before death, and the value of the spiritual life to the fulfillment of ones every other goal of life.ther demonstrates how obedience to the Master results in the greatest freedom and god-realization for all who make the effort using the right means.

But in my opinion the book's practical value ends there, with 2 stars. <br /> <br />The mathematical arguments are solid, but they are only tools for converting assumptions into consequences.  I will not be so presumptuous as to judge the assumptions (although the fact that I assign only 2 stars is indicative of my OPINION that the assumptions are subjective and questionable); that task is for you as the reader.  Rather, my intent in this review is to encourage you to focus on the author's construction of the ASSUMPTIONS.  The mathematical calculations that follow are easily verified as completely sound; please be careful not to artificially inflate the value of the assumptions because of the correctness and elegance of the math. <br /> <br />Unwin starts with 13 core assumptions. I won't be specific with them, because I believe the specifics deserve to be consumed in their appropriate context, in the book.  But here they are in basic terms: <br /> <br />1. As a starting point (representing complete ignorance), the probability of the existence of God is X1. <br />2,3. The recognition of goodness has a relative Y2 amount of evidence and offers a relative Z2 amount of support for the existence of God. <br />4,5. The existence of moral evil \\"\\" Y3 \\"\\" Z3. <br />6,7. The existence of natural evil \\"\\" Y4 \\"\\" Z4. <br />8,9. Intra-natural miracles \\"\\" Y5 \\"\\" Z5. <br />10,11. Extra-natural miracles \\"\\" Y6 \\"\\" Z6. <br />12,13. Religious experiences \\"\\" Y7 \\"\\" Z7. <br /> <br />All of these X, Y, and Z variables are assigned numerical values by Unwin.  Then the mathematical principle of Bayes' Theorem is applied (correctly) to calculate the CONDITIONAL probability that God exists given that ALL ASSUMPTIONS ARE EXACTLY TRUE.  I won't ruin your or the author's fun and reveal the answer, but I'll at least mention that it's not precisely 0 or precisely 1. <br /> <br />So, my suggestion is to read this book ONLY if you are willing to approach it with caution and use it as food for thought.  You will be sorely disappointed if you are seeking a weapon to defend your pre-existing opinions.  Please be aware that the author's conclusions should be measured based primarily on the validity of his assumptions. <br /> <br />If you're interested in learning how to better interpret assertions (like Unwin's calculated probability of God) in an objective way without being swayed by subjective or emotional persuasion, then I recommend the following books: <br />Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists (by Joel Best, 2001); Trust Us, We're Experts!: How Industry Manipulates Science and Gambles with Your Future (by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton, 2000); and an oldie but goodie, How to Lie with Statistics (by Darrell Huff, 1954). <br />	2004-08-31

It was entertaining, interesting, and will foster pride in America in those who read it, if they are open to having such pride fostered. I am, and I loved it!<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the book offered intriguing insights into why those on the left are so angry.  The reasons are not too flattering, so they probably wouldn't be appreciated by those folks who are already pretty enraged.  To be fair, the author contrasts psychological insights about the left with those of the right, and they are not the most flattering either.  In my experience, however, they rang true, though, and I did agree with the authors.<br /><br />This would be a great book for those who love America and who are looking for even more reasons to love her.  It would also be good for those who are discouraged and who wonder if there is hope for Americaa's survival as a free and good country.  If you are a reader who thinks America is not free and not good, you probably are not going to like the book--it will just make you angrier and I would suggest you pass on it.<br /><br />****	2004-08-29

It's a must read if you are considering giving Kerry  your vote especially if you currently regard him as sincere and honest.  I found it interesting that Kerry after touting his service in Vietnam as part of his 2004 election bid, is now trying to \\"tone it down\\" and blames the Bush camp for the allegations his \\"brothers in arms\\" have brought up.  Didn't President Bush just say that he considers Kerry's service in Vietnam a noble effort?  (Maybe G.W. should read this book!) Most damning is the fact that Kerry received his first Purple Heart for self-inflicted wounds after he exaggerated/falsified incident reports.  As of today,  Rear Admiral Schachte, who trained Kerry on the \\"skimmer boat\\" and was present during this incident, has  verified this.  The other fact that bothers me is that many U.S. soldiers were tortured in North Vietnamese prisons as the VietCong played tapes over and over again of Kerry's testimony which labelled all soldiers baby-killers and murderers.  It makes you wonder how many U.S. soldiers languished in those prisons while listening to Kerry's voice?  The Communists essentially thanked Kerry for his testimony which helped them win the war.  Anyone who reads this account should have serious questions about electing Kerry to the highest office in the land.	2004-08-29

Few of these people show any record of previous reviews, or the ones they have submitted are mostly with a far left wing point of view.<br /><br />One might debate whether Kerry was a \\"hero\\" for one of his awards, (and it could be only one of them at the most) but no one can debate that Kerry is a self-admitted war criminal. It is obvious that Kerry was someone who knew the \\"three purples\\" and you are out policy and it pretty obvious from eye witness accounts that he did not deserve at least two of them since they were self-inflicted and did not occur under enemy fire. But to me the most important parts of the book are not the specifics of who shot (or didn't shoot) John. Most telling are the Senator's own words which have changed so many times over the years as to make him someone who could never be believed. His testimony in front of the Senate in 1971 is based upon unverified and undocumented accounts of so-called veterans, most of whom never wore a uniform. He denied still being a member of the VVAW when that group was advocating the assassination of Congressmen, and only changed his story when the FBI released their records this year. When he was given his draft notice, he asked for a deferment to be able to study French for a year, but was turned down. Rather than be drafted, he joined the US Navy Reserves, not the US Navy and was unlucky enough to be activated. (The navy reserves were the Navy equivalent of the Air National Guard that Bush is so derided for joining.) Instead of having two tours of Vietnam as he claimed, his first \\"tour\\" included 5 weeks in the Tonkin gulf, not even within sight of Vietnam on a large ship that spent most of his one year tour off the coasts of California and Australia. When Kerry volunteered for Swift Boat duty, it was the safest tour in the Navy since it was really a taxi from big ships to safe harbors. He vehemently objected to reporting for duty when the mission changed. His first purple heart was awarded mysteriously after the attending physician said he had seen worse scrapes from a rose bush and refused to recommend him for one. It is no wonder that Kerry has refused to release all of his records. Especially since Kerry was the one who fired his weapon too close to shore and his \\"wound\\" came from a tiny piece of shrapnel from his own weapon, and there was no hostile fire that night anywhere near his boat.<br /><br />But the book is not just about \\"he said, he said\\" versus his fellow vets. It is a story of someone who took his own movie camera and \\"reenacted\\" fights which never occurred so that he could be, as he said himself, the \\"Next JFK\\".<br /><br />It is the story of a very flawed man whose record in the Senate could be predicted by his actions in Vietnam. If you really want to put someone in office who has no moral compass, than you couldn't find anyone better than Kerry, with the possible exception of the draft dodger the Democrats nominated when Kerry said Vietnam service shouldn't be a consideration for electing someone as President. But of course the imperious senator would brook no dissent from those opposed to him, as we see in his attack on the first amendment rights of his fellow Vietnam vets who happen to disagree with him about his qualifications for service as president. As Senator Edwards requested, the American people are spending \\"three minutes\\" with Kerry's fellow vets to find out what kind of man he is. Kerry's problem is that the \\"conversation\\" isn't limited to just the five he wanted us to hear from, we are hearing it from the hundreds who served on his boat, or within 50 feet of him, and saw him in action during his short four months in Vietnam before he finished manipulating the systemand ran for cover just as soon as he could. Now that those brave men who stayed for their full tour of duty (including many who could have left after they got their purple hearts) are speaking up, they are attacked by the same people who found no problem with multibillionaires funding their \\"527\\" sleaze machines against President Bush.ver just as soon as he could.

This is a good book that deserves both your consideration and some serious criticism.   <br /> <br />I am amazed at the length of time we have been concerned about proper nutrition and the lack of consensus we have achieved.  I have had my weight fluctuate up and down for 20 years now and, as such, have experienced most diets and programs (Weight Watchers, Nutri System, Lean Bodies, Atkins, Pritikin, The Zone, Blood Type).  My experience (and my family's, as they have always participated, either due to my \\"hard sell\\" on the latest \\"unassailable information\\" or just as a sympathy act to encourage me to be healthier) can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br />1) Calories matter.  No matter the program, a proper balance of intake is required for optimum health.  Nutri System/Weight Watchers were far too calorie-restrictive (I am 5'11\\" with an ideal weight around 200lbs) -- NS had me on 1200/cal/day -- causing fatigue that limited my exercise.  An extreme, but \\"permitted\\", use of Atkins stopped my weight loss (it's easy to consume 5000+/cal/day when you put mayo on everything!)  Figure out your caloric output and try to limit your intake to something reasonably approaching your output.  If you're active, the margin for error can be greater. <br /> <br />2) White flour/refined sugar are bad.  Nothing more needs to be said here -- if your diet calls for it, only 100% whole grain breads should be consumed.  Refined sugar is to be avoided. <br /> <br />3) Blood type matters.  My wife and I tried Atkins together.  It worked for me, but made her ill.  Then we read Blood Type.  She is 'A' and I am 'O'.  Precisely as D'Adamo describes I irritated my bowel with too many grains and she had the same experience with red meat.  My father has MS and his diet has been a great struggle.  Since we adjusted him to a better mix of sprouted wheat bread, chicken and fish, he has not only lost weight (which put a tremendous strain on his atrophying legs) but he has regained some strength. <br /> <br />D'Adamo loses a star for his lack of scientific method in presenting evidence (it seems to me much of what he claims could be easily verified by clinical studies); linking diseases to blood type which the medical community seems to reject out of hand; and, confusing presentation of some \\"Beneficial\\" or \\"Avoid\\" food items that don't make sense (e.g., Sparking water is beneficial for me -- why?  I suspect it is beneficial only if I am replacing cola with sparkling water, but this goes unstated.) <br /> <br />Get this book.  Read the others (there is overlap in Atkins' discussion of ketosis and the role of insulin in fat metabolism; calories need to be restricted in some fashion) and reject the resistance of doctors and dieticians to be open to new evidence.  Their inability to admit they may have been wrong is damaging to YOUR health!	2004-08-26

O'Neill, regarding John Kerry's time with the Swift Boats in Vietnam and later in reference to and about Kerry's time spent as an executive/official spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War [VVAW]. <br /> <br />The 1st part of the book mainly details the Kerry 4-month-tour in and near Cam Ranh Bay--the supposed safe spot to be in Vietnam. An already decidedly self-proclaimed \\"anti-war\\" propagator from an elite Ivy League school, young John Kerry immediately polarizes at least some of his fellow comrades with his anti-war bent. Before \\"reporting for duty\\" then, Kerry had tried & failed to obtain a student deferral.  <br /> <br />To me, It seems Kerry had/still has an affinity for spinning delusional lies of his Vietnam experience; why else would one tote an 8mm camera to war & stage film footage of earlier battle scenes--with Kerry the war-hero filmed in his restaged battle scenes showing John Kerry impersonating a war hero in these films now being used for political gain on the campaign tour. <br /> <br />O'Neill does an decent job of using his source material and of weaving the events discussed back & forth between Kerry's grandiose 'lies' & as O'Neill puts it: \\"What really happened\\" allegations (I won't say \\"truth\\" because the truth: that is between God and Kerry, now. We all can only speculate now. With regards to views stated by other Swifty's pro & against Kerry--war can decidly cloud reality.)--after portraying yet another Kerry spin on things. <br /> <br />Maybe, Kerry wants the public to believe he was some sort of \\"rebel with a cause,\\" going on--portraying himself in a radiant light of one who openly challenged and questioned his superiors at every alleged wrong-turn. According to the author, Kerry was quite \\"complacent\\" amongst his superiors & further says that some of Kerry's superiors even sent him notes of \\"congratulations,\\" regarding his sterling military actions. He got \\"Bravo\\" letters for killing so many VC-- (ghosts, it would seem to some who served with him--since it is written that Kerry made them up). The author even writes of Kerry writing up a field report of a \\"wounded baby\\" (that O'Neill implies is a result of Kerry's incompetence {sleeping below deck, while patrolling a river}) as a captured VC prisoner in one report, according to O'Neill. <br /> <br />It seems (from my interpretation of descriptions in \\"Unfit for Command\\"), Kerry would have us believe that while in Vietnam he questioned all the war atrocities that he--Kerry even admits to committing war atrocities, later, in his VVAW years--and his fellow soldiers were \\"commanded\\" (from commander in chief on down) to perform routinely. Historical data--Kerry speeches, writings, etc--shows that Kerry's main issue, while fighting against the war through VVAW channels (was on his alleged perception, though \\"probably\\" inaccurate, description--in VVAW speeches/debates/testimony to the Fulbright Commitee) was of charges of Kerry & others in VVAW's data of alleged daily, routine military-ordered practice of constant commison of war atrocities. <br /> <br />The author says many of Kerry's comrades refused to go on patrol with him. Allegedly, some of their reasons mentioned in \\"Unfit for Command\\" Include: 1.) Kerry was \\"dangerous\\"  in that he exercised no fire control & that Kerry would shoot at anything in the river. 2.) Kerry was \\"a coward & only care about his own self-preservation-- example written about--Kerry routinely \\"fled\\" upriver at the first hint of \\"enemy gunfire\\", thus, leaving the other boats/personnel less protected.  <br /> <br />O'Neill states that some Kerry \\"labels\\" by his comrades stationed with him include: \\"perpetual whiner,\\" \\"glory-seeking,\\" & \\"self-promoting.\\" <br /> <br />O'Neill charges that Kerry's own (implied) inepitude with grenades netted him two of his Purple Hearts--both listed as self-inflicted wounds. And that none of Kerry's \\"wounds\\" involved injury caused by the enemy--as is required to get the Purple Heart. Allegations bu the author include how Kerry \\"gamed the system\\" to obtain his awards. <br /> <br />On March 13, 1969 Kerry netted his 3rd Purple Heart. He was supposed to have been approached about leaving Vietnam due to the 3 Purple Hearts & you can leave clause. The book mentions that Kerry's journal recalls him agonizing over the \\"torturous\\" decision of whether to stay in Vietnam or to come back to the US--he allegedly agonized about his decision to leave his friends in Vietnam for \\"two weeks\\" before deciding to come home. This is interesting to note with respect to this fact: Kerry left 4 days after getting his 3rd Purple Heart; not two weeks. Kerry left Vietnam on March 17, 1969. <br /> <br />The second part of the book deals with Kerry's activities once back home and esp. deals with his involvement with/for the VVAW--a supposed Communist (per O'Neill sources such as the FBI) supported organization. According to some of the alleged accounts described in \\"Unfit for Command,\\"--if they really are true, then, Kerry's actions could have been considered as traitorous and  treasonous. <br /> <br />O'Neill discusses various VVAW/Kerry involvements. Some events were allegedly documented/verified attended by and/or participated in by John Kerry and the VVAW.  <br /> <br />Since Kerry has made his self-claimed \\"war-hero\\" status an issue, again, why does he harp on Bush's missing Guard record; when Kerry, himself refuses to \\"execute\\" STANDARD FORM 180--Kerry refuses to publicly execute for his military/medical records to be public. Both of them should show us their records. The past is often indicative of one's future actions. We, voters/Americans, are entitled to the full story. <br /> <br />Other thoughts regarding Kerry with regards to O'Neill's work: <br /> <br />It is terrifying to consider that if O'Neill's book is even partially true, America is headed for a terrible demise.... <br />  <br />If\\"Unfit for Command\\" is true: I, as a former torture victim, myself, am scared immensely for our kids in Iraq & Afghanistan considering this (if John Kerry is our next president): This could be our next President:  <br /> <br />According to one Vietnam POW in this O'Neill book: As Kerry poured out his anti-war sentiments and his speeches; they allegedly were recorded by VC holding US POW's. Our POW's were said to be tortured (per Paul Galanti POW, p.107-8] and killed to the drone of John Kerry anti war speeches. <br /> <br />O'Neill's book is full of similar \\"shocking\\" charges others have allegedly communicated to O'Neill. <br /> <br />\\"Read Unfit for Command!\\" Decide for yourself.... <br />--------------------------- <br />\\"To really understand John Kerry, you have to listen to those who served with him in Vietnam.\\"  --John Edwards, vice presidential canditate of the Democratic Party  <br /> <br />---Ely Montana, Seeker of the Truth <br />   \\"Ban Censorship\\"	2004-08-25
US	29635209	R3RRVSQG821YTU	0895260174	829131114	Unfit For Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A detailed convincing account, but Kerry still did serve.	Even a critic of Kerry must admit that a bullet flying a few feet to the left or right could have killed Kerry in Vietnam.  Whatever truth this book presents (and it is overwhelming), and however much Kerry may have exaggerated his service, his life was in danger during this war, and other soldiers fighting for our country have died from self-inflicted shrapnel wounds.  Those who oppose Kerry need to refrain from the exaggerated attacks that have marred the Left's opposition to Bush, a la Michael Moore.   <br /> <br />That said, having read this book, I can easily understand why these war veterans feel such anger and resentment towards Kerry, and I don't believe they are attacking him at the instigation of Bush.   Kerry launched his political career back in 1971 by giving credibility to atrocity charges that he never witnessed and never verified.  He intentionally slandered his fellow soldiers for his own political benefit, and these soldiers then returned with a moral cloud over them, a perception continued with movies like \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now\\".  The idea that our soldiers went from WWII heroes to Vietnam war criminals is a fiction for which there is little historical basis and for which soldiers other than Kerry have suffered.  Had Kerry any sense of integrity, he would immediately apologize for those statements and any pain they caused.   <br /> <br />This book describes Kerry's open opposition to Vietnam during his four years at Yale, raising the obvious question of why Kerry would volunteer for service in a war he felt to be immoral.  According to O'Neill, the draft board denied Kerry's requested deferment to study in France, so he volunteered in the Navy Reserves, a position no more dangerous at the time than the Texas National Guard.  In 1968, Admiral Zumwalt, to Kerry's great consternation, increased the role of swiftboats in Vietnam to include excursions into the Mekong Delta.  According to his commanders, Kerry objected to these new duties, although there is no evidence he ever failed to do as he was ordered.   <br /> <br />To summarize this book's account of the war, O'Neill portrays Kerry as a soldier who's heart was never in it.  He objected to its goals and its performance from day one and, after three superficial wounds, he took advantage of the Navy's \\"three purple hearts and you're out\\" rule and left. <br /> <br />Upon his return to the U.S., Kerry collaborated with many very suspect characters to form \\"Vietnam Veterans Against the War\\".  This group organized a show trial of the American military in which veterans took the stand and purported to describe grotesque atrocities committed by our soldiers.  Although many of these alleged veterans were revealed to be frauds, Kerry summarized and presented their statements to Congress in a now-famous presentation in which he alleged that our military was engaged in systematic war crimes that went up the full chain of command.  When challenged by O'Neill on the Dick Cavett show in 1971 to present a single example, Kerry could not do so. <br /> <br />In 1971, Kerry co-authored a book entitled \\"The New Soldier\\" which has a cover portraying several long-haired radicals hoisting an upside-down American flag in a mock Iwo Jima pose.  O'Neill claims that Kerry supporters have tried to suppress this book by purchasing all copies.  As a result, it currently costs $800.00 at amazon.com.  Barnes and Noble, a Kerry supporter according to Kerry's website, does not even list this book on their website for reasons I can only surmise.   <br /> <br />It is clear that Kerry was not a soldier who gladly went to Vietnam where he became disillusioned.  He opposed the war openly before he went, and he left as soon as he could.  That said, Bush and Cheney did not fight at all and never risked their life to the extent Kerry did, even by O'Neill's account.  The facts of this book should be irrelevant to the 2004 election, but for Kerry's odd fixation with his service there, including his now-debunked claim about being in Cambodia during Christmas, 1968. <br /> <br />Kerry's problem is that his congressional testimony regarding Vietnam atrocities really is \\"seared\\" into the memories of hundreds of his fellow veterans.  I'm no political adviser, but I suspect Kerry himself is surprised by how much anger still exists from those statements 30 years later.  He should publicly apologize for his irresponsible and slanderous accusations of war crimes, and perhaps most of the impetus behind this book and the concurrent ads would go away.  My guess is that these veterans really want an admission that their own Vietnam service was admirable from the man who slandered them so publicly so long ago. <br />	2004-08-25
US	40479230	REHTZ33SV1ZE0	0060562544	570610919	American Evita: Hillary Clinton's Path to Power	Books	1	23	40	N	N	Save your money	I must be one of the five* people in this country who neither love nor hate Hillary Clinton.  Given that she IS a subject of intense interest to so many, I was curious to find out why so many hate her and why so many love her.  So I bought this book.  Boy oh boy oh boy, was I naive!  This book is NOT anything like an examination of why Hillary is an \\"American Evita\\".     <br /> <br />I wish I had read some of the reviews here before I bought this book, which I did more or less on impulse at a local bookstore.  {sigh}  As one person noted, this book is \\"researched\\" by using previously published sources, without resorting to original research and/or fact checking on Mr. Andersen's part.    Note to Mr. Andersen:  Just because a \\"news\\" item made it to print does NOT mean that it has been verified as true.   <br /> <br />I made it about 1/3 to 1/2 way through the book before I finally gave up.  My ability to ignore my disgust broke down, and I just couldn't continue to slog through this mean-spirited tome.  Why \\"mean-spirited\\"?  Mr. Andersen misses few opportunities to put the most negative SPIN he can think of onto any and every action of Mrs. Clinton.   Just as an illustration of this, he asserts that Hillary was delighted that Chelsea had grown old enough to endure a little public scrutiny, because Hillary could then USE Chelsea to bolster her own image.  No credence given to even the possibility that a mother might just be happy to be able to spend time with her daughter?  Given that, during the Clinton Administration, Hillary could hardly twitch a muscle without intense scrutiny (favorable or negative), they must have had to forego many public moments that other mothers and daughters could enjoy.  Sure, Chelsea's parents chose public life.  That doesn't mean that their only interest in their daughter is for whatever polishing she could do to her parents' images.   <br /> <br />Since beginning and then putting down this book, I have been doing other reading.  Troopergate, which is given considerable \\"play\\" in this book, and is presented as fact, was a fabrication of Clinton enemies.  The man who first brought this manufactured scandal to the American new media, David Brock, details the \\"players\\" in this manufactured story and his own role in it, in his book, \\"Blinded by the Right\\".    I hesitated to believe anything from a self-confessed hatchet man for the right (Brock), but ultimately, I was persuaded by the facts that Mr. Brock did his career no favors and considerable damage by his confessions of his complicity in manufactured liberal bashing.  The \\"Right\\" now hates him and the \\"Left\\" doesn't trust him.   <br /> <br />Another reviewer wondered, as did I, how Mr. Andersen could state what a person was thinking.   I did a little poking around on the 'Net and discovered a site with an interview with Mr. Andersen.  That very question came up in the interview.  Mr. Andersen claims to be amazed at this criticism.  He says that  \\"When I describe what people are thinking, that is based on what the subjects . . . told people they were thinking at the time.\\"   Read most of the thoughts he attributes to Hillary and ask yourself: [a] Would ANYONE tell such thoughts to another person, unless that other person was a close and trustworthy friend, and [b] if a supposed \\"close and trustworthy friend\\" was revealing such things to a writer, would you believe everything this person said or would you be asking yourself what axe they were grinding to betray the subject in such a manner?  I further ask myself \\"What stake does this author have in swallowing these reports whole?\\" and the answer that comes to mind first is \\"Big bucks from sensationalizm, sells much better than actual facts!\\"  <br /> <br />Now I am left with a smarmy unreadable book.  I don't know what to do with it.  I don't want to pass it on to anyone else, as I think it is a piece of trash.  And it goes against my thrifty recycling soul to just junk it.  {sigh}   If I could havegiven this less than one star, I would have done so.  Total waste of money.  Unless wallowing in trash seems a worthwhile use of your money? <br /> <br />*I exaggerated for effect.  There must be at least ten or twenty of us!	2004-08-24

If so, I would encourage you to read this book. <br /> <br />The book opens with the fallacy of \\"the best college\\" that college rankings tend to foster. To produce a ranking, each college is reduced to a single number. But can an experience as complex as college really be expressed as a single number? The book discusses problems with producing the ranking such as unverified data, sensitivity to minor changes in data values, selection of criteria to measure, and getting input from college presidents but not students. <br /> <br />The book then continues by discussing the elements of a quality education: <br />1. A commitment to general education throughout all four years of college. <br />2. A commitment to writing, speaking, and critical-thinking skills for all students in every class. <br />3. A commitment to active learning (including interactions between the faculty and students beyond the classroom). <br />4. Opportunities for learning beyond the classroom (such as education abroad and internships). <br />5. A diverse, intellectually active, and respectful community. <br /> <br />Please note what this book is not: it is not a complete guide to  choosing a college. For example, it does not discuss cost, location, setting (urban, suburban, etc.), or distance from home. Also, the book deemphasizes the choice of a major more than I feel is appropriate. For example, if your child wants to go into engineering, choosing a small liberal arts college would probably be a poor choice. <br /> <br />In summary, I highly recommend this book for three types of people: <br />1. If you and your child are choosing colleges based on their ranking and reputation, this book should help you understand the fallacy of college rankings. <br />2. If you and your child are in the process of selecting a college, this book discusses factors you will probably want to consider in making your decision. <br />3. If you and your child have selected a lower-ranked school, this book should help you deal with friends and relatives who still subscribe to the myth of \\"the best college.\\"	2004-08-24

Modern 'liberals' are a very different breed from the classical type and it is obvious to any reasonable person that they've been controlling the media and popular culture for quite some time now. I am from the UK where marxism, using the vehicle of political correctness and 'liberalism' has run amok - recently, a centuries old florentine statue of a Boar was removed from a historical city park in Derby because of liberal and muslim objections that the 'pig' was offensive. <br /> <br />Initially I was introduced to Ann Coulter by reading the Al Franken book.  The two books couldn't be more different - she is meticulous and thorough, he is slapshod and emotional - she is genuinely witty and has a sophisticated understanding of irony, he is clumsy and irrelevant with surprisingly little humour, they are poles apart. <br /> <br />Anyone saying this book is rubbish can't have read it or checked its sources.... but then we know already that such people are not concerned with logic or honest debate, Coulter herself points this out, it wouldn't matter if God himself came down and verified the truth of this book, these same people would just put their fingers in their ears and scream. <br /> <br />I find it very heartening that people like Coulter have the courage to do this kind of work, it gives me some hope for the future. <br /> <br />If you think of yourself as open minded or intelligent then you really should read this book.	2004-08-23

McGowan, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, believes that the media's quest for 'diversity' shapes their perspective on how to present the news and what stories to cover. Part of the argument here is that, because news organizations want to 'correct' their historically white-male centered coverage, they are willing to shape stories about minority groups however the groups see fit. This includes not running pictures of accused criminals because it may cause racial backlash (more recently, in a protest at UC Berkeley), and using a quota system to make sure that at least a certain amount of \\"people around town\\" pictures that a newspaper runs are African-American.<br /><br />McGowan's title may be a bit misleading, and potentially a bit controversial, if only for the \\"coloring\\" part of the title. McGowan does not single out media coverage of African-Americans, showing that the media also shape their coverage to not offend gays, lesbians and, more recently, Arab-Americans. Instances of these include coverage of gay adoption and racial profiling.<br /><br />This book is not an easy read. The paperback version is only 250-odd pages, but the text is small and there are few breaks in chapters. I was having difficulty reading it until I got towards the last 100 pages, when the stuff that McGowan documents just becomes so jaw-dropping that one can't believe it is actually true. This includes a Vermont newspaper story that got a writer fired without the normal process of disputing the charges taking place because of a small backlash from an agitator in the community. The agitator was hired by the newspaper to help shape the paper's coverage of the black community and, when an independent source verified that the original article was factually accurate, ended up with the editor's resignation. The book reads a lot like a text book and less like a partisan attack (although at times McGowan is obviously arguing that one point of view is correct, but is still able to show why the coverage, nonetheless, is skewed).<br /><br />Whereas books like Bias and Spin Sisters rely upon first hand experience of the inner workings of the media, Coloring the News is all about research. Unfortunately, McGowan does not provide footnotes (he does provide notes at the end with descriptions of what he is citing), which, unless you take the time to read the notes at the end, makes it difficult to know exactly what is coming from where.<br /><br />If you are a member of the media, you must read this book. If you care about media bias, read this book. If you're a casual reader, I can't recommend it to you.

He seems to feel that DeNiro has wasted his talents by taking on roles in bad movies or hasn't lived up to his early promise. True, perhaps, in some respects, but if you were to believe Baxter, DeNiro's last great performance was Taxi Driver in 1976! Baxter criticizes DeNiro's acting in Raging Bull, one of the most amazing performances by any actor on film. Aside from his obvious lack of enthusiasm for DeNiro's acting, I have to question a lot of the facts of this book. By the second or third page of the book, when Baxter states that Awakenings was released in 1987 (it came out in 1990) I couldn't help but wonder what other mistakes I would find. There were many, too many to remember. His descriptions of film plots are often wrong, his descriptions of characters in films are often wrong (saying that John Cazale in Dog Day Afternoon was robbing a bank so that his lover could have a sex change operation--it was actually Pacino's character's lover!

Though the reviewer tries to give the impression that he read the book (even to the point of giving it three stars), it is quite apparent that he did not read the book and instead quoted standard Mormon polemics. <br /> <br />The reviewer said that the comparisons between the Book of Mormon and Ethan Smith's View of the Hebrews are \\"coincidences only.\\"  In his book, Persuitte shows that the story line of the Book of Mormon can be found in Ethan Smith's book.  In addition, nearly 100 pages of Persuitte's book deal with the parallels between the two books in question -- and this in a book with oversize dimensions and two-column pages.  There must be several hundred parallels and a very large number of them are quite specific.  Hardly \\"coincidences only.\\" <br /> <br />The reviewer said \\"the Book of Mormon is genuine in its accounts.\\"  Persuitte shows quite convincingly that the Book of Mormon is a work of fiction that is based on Ethan Smith's book and that it has no basis in reality or in the history of ancient America. <br /> <br />The reviewer said that Joseph Smith would not have been able to write the Book of Mormon or \\"plan\\" to write it and that \\"the translation of the book was completed in about 10 weeks. All 531 pages, plus an additional 116 pages that were stolen.\\"  Persuitte shows that Joseph Smith had two years to plan the book and that he actually wrote it (dictated it, that is) over a period of about 10 months.  And that 10-month period did not include the time he dictated the 116 pages that were lost. <br /> <br />The reviewer said that there were 11 other witnesses (besides Joseph Smith) to the gold plates that Smith supposedly translated from.  Persuitte points out that one of the witnesses, Martin Harris, when asked if he actually saw the gold plates, said \\"No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.\\"  Harris also said theother witnesses saw them \\"only in vision or imagination\\" and were \\"persuaded\\" to sign the statement that they had seen the plates. <br /> <br />The reviewer said that \\"a copy of the characters and their translation from the plates were taken to New York and verified to be `the most accurate of any translation...' by a professor Anthon of ancient languages.\\"  Persuitte shows that it was Joseph Smith who self-aggrandizingly made that statement and attributed it to Martin Harris (the person who brought the copy to New York) several months after Harris left the church (Smith also erroneously named the professor \\"Anthony\\").  In fact, Harris told several people that Anthon could not translate the characters.  Professor Anthon himself provided two separate accounts of the Harris visit.  Harris had told Anthon that he was asked to provide money to pay for the publication of the book, and Anthon told Harris that he thought it was a scheme to cheat him of his money.  Harris asked for that opinion in writing, which Anthon refused to give.  Harris then asked Anthon for his written opinion on the characters, which Anton did give.  According to Anthon the characters were merely an imitation of various alphabetical characters and had, in his opinion, no meaning connected with them.  Also, Anthon stated that he was not given a translation. <br /> <br />The above not only responds to the reviewer, but also shows some of the detailed content of the book.  All of this should make it clear that the reviewer did not actually read the book.  If he had, he would not have used the arguments he did, or in the way he did.  He also most likely would have given the book one star out of spite. <br /> <br />As for the quotation from the Book of Mormon that the reviewer gave, that was a standard religious psychological trap rephrased for the reader of the Book of Mormon.  It was in the Book of Mormon specifically for that purpose, and the reviewer himself fell into the trap. <br /> <br />	2004-08-12

The two committees proposed to jointly examine acceptable risk to lifelines threatened by natural disasters. Later this theme was 'upgraded' to one of ASCE's Blueprints for Change.<br /><br />Lifeline systems include energy (oil, electric power, gas), water and wastewater, transportation (air, land, sea modes), and communication networks. Key elements in risk evaluations are the damage estimation and its probability of occurrence, as well as a treatment of uncertainties. The presence of many parameters in models, in which assumptions are at best only partially verified, implies that there can be a virtually never-ending search for improvements of models, data, and assumptions (according to the editors Taylor and Vanmarcke). Apart from these technical issues the monograph contains also publications on risk criteria issues, and communication, administration and regulatory issues.<br /><br />The two ASCE committees have expressed the intent in subsequent publications. The reviewer is sure that many people will be looking forward to the next report.	2004-08-10

But first we meet Christina, the daughter for whom the yacht (upon which so much of the power sex in this  book takes place) is named.  Mere months before her suicide, bright but doomed Christina drops a bombshell over lunch with the author, illustrating a connection between Bobby Kennedy's assassination and Aristotle Onassis'<br />money.<br /><br />Within each family many secrets were held, from each other and from the world. \\"Nemesis\\" depicts the outer edge of an age where secrecy was still available from the press as well, and politicians and other celebrities were able to live in half-shadow, to disguise the emptiness of their arranged lives.  Their wanton dance of destruction in this environment is fascinating to watch.  If the author had said, in one of his many footnotes, that he had strapped an old gypsy woman to a lie detector machine and verified that she was responsible for placing the curse on the Onassis and Kennedy clans, I'd believe him. You can't read about young Alexander Onassis dying in a plane crash without thinking of John Kennedy, Jr.  Obviously, there is a pox on both their houses.  How else can you explain<br />so much unhappiness and loss in the midst of so much privilege and wealth?<br /><br />The story of Kennedy and Onassis lends itself to conspiracy theories.  (Look at the two names together . . . each has seven letters with two consonants in the middle; that's got to mean something!)  Mr. Evans has familiarized himself with the voluminous material available on the topic (including Anthony Summers \\"Goddess,\\" which places Bobby in Marilyn's house the day she died) and he hacks through the forest of speculation surrounding the families with a silent chainsaw, stylishly, but at times indelicately, providing a stream of jaw-dropping facts and sublime quotes which recall Truman Capote as he decimated his beloved socialites in \\"La Cote Basque.\\"<br /><br />In fact, Mr. Evans runs the risk of casting doubt upon the veracity of his book because he's obviously having such a good time with the antics of his monsters . . .  it is a tale about shady tale-tellers after all, and truth really is stranger than fiction.  But to those as curious as Mr. Evans is about this era, his suppositions have the ring of truth to them.<br /><br />In the absence of empathy or compassion, however, this book suffers. Every one of these creatures, with the exception of poor Maria Callas, seems to exercise their worst motivation at every opportunity.<br /><br />Although the author makes it hard to see the principals as anything more than a pack of horny, sociopathic vampires drawn to each other in some kind of weird, karmic death embrace, you get the feeling he has given you the goods. I honestly feel I never need to read another word on Kennedy or Onassis after \\"Nemesis.\\" Nor do I want to.  (We want to see them hoisted up, but we don't necessarily want to see them beaten with sticks.)<br /><br />Peter Evans has supplied a great read that appeals -- in spite of the occasional feeling that, even with all the footnotes and attributions and acknowledgements, he might not have it quite yet.  There is the whiff of speculation.  After all, Christina Onassis loathed Jacqueline Kennedy.  So Evans has buttressed his central revelation with several sources who back him up in his assumption.  It seems credible.  \\"Nemesis\\" reads like a political thriller, which indeed it is, a real-life<br />\\"Manchurian Candidate.\\"  And if it's true, it is easily one of the most incredibleand horrifying stories of our time.<br /><br />It's the kind of book where you stop at times and marvel at how<br />beautifully, and savagely, written it is. And how talented Peter Evans is.<br /><br />He's a great storyteller.here you stop at times and marvel at how  beautifully, and savagely, written it is. And how talented Peter Evans is.

If those of you who have read the book and believe that the Book of Mormon is a made up work then you have not done your due dillegence in investigating it.  Had you done your homework, you would find that the Book of Mormon is genuine in its accounts and that many of the things found and verified in the Book of Mormon (historically speaking) were not discovered until many years later.  You also miss the point that Joseph Smith was uneducated and by himself would not have been able to write the Book of Mormon or \\"plan\\" to write it.  Or the fact that there were 11 other witnesses to the Gold Plates from whence they came.  Or the fact that a copy of the characters and their translation from the plates were taken to New York and verified to be \\"the most accurate of any translation...\\" by a professor Anthon of ancient languages.   <br /> <br />Then another point was the fact that the translation of the book was completed in about 10 weeks.  All 531 pages, plus an additional 116 pages that were stolen.   <br /> <br />Anyone reading this book or this review, if TRUELY interested in finding out about the Book of Mormon, can do so if they are willing to put forth the time and effort.  Otherwise, all you will get are opinions.   <br /> <br />The facts that support it originality abound.  But aside from that, the book was authored as for use in our lives as a spiritual guide just as the Bible is and when read with \\"real intent\\" you will find that it provides just that.   <br /> <br />And one other comment to close, if this book is a fake, why, at the end of the book would Moroni, one of the authors of the book, give the promise in chapter 10:3-5 and I will quote  <br /> <br />\\"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto hte children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.   <br /> <br />And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.   <br /> <br />And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"   <br /> <br />Because of this promise, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, otherwise know as the LDS church or the Mormon church has over 10 million members worldwide and has withstood every arguement made from the most learned men then and now as to the origin of the Book of Mormon. <br /> <br />I have read the Book of Mormon and have taken the challenge of Moroni.  I would challenge you to do the same if you really want to know of its truth.	2004-08-07

The Bible also says that these people returned from their captivity. These episodes in the Bible are not fictitious since there is archeological support (don't believe me?

Even if you don't believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible, you can't deny that some parts of the Bible are proven facts&quot;. <br />  <br /> Point#1: LOL this is tantamount to saying that since the movie Escape From New York took place in an actual city and can be verified by archeological support then the fictitious character in that movie (Snake Palaski) really existed.

Although the book has a list of sources in the back, they are not cross-referenced to any of the material in the book. This leaves the reader with several choices. 1. Accept his premise entirely, 2. Accept parts of his premise (which parts are fact, which parts are fiction?), or 3. reject his premise entirely. What a conundrum. I can reject item 3 because I would have had to have been living on the moon for the last 20 years to escape the wealth of information negating that premise.

Lenburg has done a remarkable job in writing this authorized and harrowing story. What some readers have failed to take into account is the historical context of Veronica Lake's mental illness and the era (the 1930s) in which she was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic. Back then, people were often institutionalized, and medical treatment was far more limited than it is today. Throughout history, many other notable figures, also ravaged by schizophrenia when little was done for their condition, managed to hide their illness and separate their public and private lives. Certainly, Lenburg did not create or fabricate the circumstances that Veronica Lake lived, and the fact she was tormented for years by mental and was a self-professed alcoholic, he did not rely on her \\"fuzzy\\" memory of the truth. Every fact and story were carefully corroborated and substantiated by Lenburg by Lake's mother, family members, and over 40 of her closest co-workers and friends. This includes those accounts as told by Veronica in her own autobiography, each corroborated and verified by the author for inclusion. This also includes many new revelations about Lake that she never revealed in her book, such as a secret abortion, spousal abuse, a possible lesbian relationship, extramarital affairs, and much more. In addition, Lenburg uncovers the truth about other stories told the national press by Lake or Paramount's publicity department that, for many years, were believed true by fans and the media only to turn out false.  Unlike other \\"tell-all\\" books that don't always attribute the source of their information in the text or throughout, Lenburg does an admirable job in this case. He consistently provides testimonial evidence with actual quotes from Lake's mother and the people he interviewed who knew herbest about many of the instances and stories described in his book.  Similarly, Lenburg presents a fair, balanced, fully fleshed, true and accurate portrait of Lake without exhibiting any bias toward Lake or her mother.  Final judgment of both, whether they were each crazy, or who was at fault is at it should be, it's left up to the reader to decide. The bottom line: \\"Peekaboo\\" is a fascinating read, well worth the time and effort about a voluptuous vixen who's life was a disaster from beginning to end.	2004-08-03

Unless you have advanced cryptographic mathematical skills you won't understand the book.  And even more important, you won't be able to verify that the unproven, unorthodox cryptographic techniques shown in the book actually work in the real world.<br /><br />This book is not for computer programmers.  It contains no code - no examples; no framework; no implementation.  After extensive searching on the Internet, I could find no implementation of any of Stephen's proprietary algorithms he presents in the book.  The book contains only mathematic formulas - which would be extremely challenging to implement in code correctly.  Further, none of the algorithms can be implemented using standard cryptographic algorithms - they have to be implemented from scratch!  Also, Stephen has patented many, if not all, of his cryptographic techniques - so you might not be able to use them even if you wanted to.<br /><br />Lastly, the author, Stephen Brands, has completely vanished out of public life since he wrote this book.  He has not published anything, anywhere.  None of his cryptographic techniques have been implemented - even though he went to work for a software company in Canada which was granted rights to his patents.  Some programmers have done residency work with Stephen on cryptographic projects at this company, but none of this work has been made commercial.  The very fact that Stephen has been unable to produce any commercial application of this work, shows that something is wrong somewhere.<br /><br />If someone with the proper mathematical skills can verify that Stephen proprietary cryptographic algorithms are correct; and that they can provide privacy and security; and they can implement them in real code that can be tested and verified secure; and they are not protected by patents; then I would be very interested in this product!	2004-08-02

After reading all these glowing reviews by other readers, I felt that here could truly be a new look into an otherwise well researched area.  WRONG.  After trying to confirm some of the source material cited, I gave up.  Much of the supporting alleged facts are bogus, misreported, misquoted, unverified racist ramblings, or often just patently stupid.  Just because some crack-pot has published something, doesn't mean it's true and you can authoritatively cite it as a source.  You don't like a fact, then make up your own and publish it yourself.

If you were unaware of the history behind &quot;The Yellow Star&quot;, you might find the idea of a negative review of this book distasteful. After all, what kind of cold-hearted lizard would be so cruel as to give a poor rating to a book that speaks about a king's love of his countrymen? What sort of sad sack of garbage would put down a story in which all persons, regardless of religion, are treated as human beings by their benevolent king? I mean, for a person to do such a thing they'd have to have a very very good reason. They'd have to feel, for example, that the book was a travesty against the very people it's attempting to praise. Such a reviewer am I. And such a terrible book is &quot;The Yellow Star&quot;.<br /><br /> Allow me to sum it up. As stated in the title, this tale is the legend of King Christian X of Denmark. A noble man, his subjects loved him dearly and he always made wise decisions. One day, however, the Nazis came. Though Christian was able to stave off their insistence that the Nazi flag fly high, he was powerless against an edict that would force all Jews to wear the yellow star. After much soul searching and pondering, King Christian came up with a brilliant solution. The next day, while riding his horse amongst the people as usual, the king sported a yellow star of his own. And in time all the Danish people did the same.<br /><br /> Ah, you say. What an inspiring story. What a swell testament to such a strong man and his convictions. What a... WHAT? You're telling me it isn't true? Nope. As it happens you may have missed the word &quot;legend&quot; in the subtitle. Now there was a King Christian of Denmark, yes. And he was a good king. Why, a simple reading of the excellent &quot;Number the Stars&quot; (a book that the author of this tale mentions in her Author's Note, none to my surprise) will prove that much. And sadly, &quot;Number the Stars&quot;, though a fiction, is far more truthful than this particular creation. Now don't get me wrong. The author freely admits in the Author's Note that this story isn't true. I wonder how many parents regularly read such notes to their kids after reading this story... hm. I wonder how many adults would even bother with an Author's Note themselves? Author Deedy writes that this book is supposed to be a &quot;what if?&quot; story. She then lists the actions the Danes actually took against the oppressive Nazis. It's as if their actual efforts weren't enough. Who cares if they smuggled 7,000 Jews to Sweden? Who cares that of the 500 deported only 51 died? Let's write a fairy tale instead where ALL the Jews were perfectly safe because their big hearted king saved them, the end. What kind of person looks at human suffering and the heroics that went into saving a group from destruction and then says, &quot;It wasn't enough. I need to make a story where the king did even more&quot;? Not only is this insulting to the very people you're trying to commemorate, but you've just treated their accomplishments as paltry. This book is a slap in the face to every Dane that actually saved a Jewish life. It says to them, &quot;Ah yes, you were fine, but what if you'd done THIS?&quot;. It makes me sick. And when Deedy lists the Danes accomplishments in her Author's Note, how do you know what she writes is true? She never quotes a single source or backs up any of her facts with reliable resources. She could be making up every word in this book (rather than every other word) and we'd never be the wiser.<br /><br /> For a fun time, check out some of the professional reviews of this picture book. If you look on the back cover of &quot;Yellow Star&quot; you may see a quote from School Library Journal that says, &quot;Deed's language is simple and rhythmic...

Sagan finds the fellow curious, interested in man and his universe but full of media distributed pseudoscience with exciting news of \\"excessively genial\\" aliens flying about earth in their UFOs, poltergeists, crystal powers and astrology - i.e. sexy flash that sells. With common man so full of crop circles and mental telepathy, Sagan is sad to discover the more amazing facts of science entirely absent, or so twisted out of shape that their sound bite representations are something else all together. We want so much to be roused from our \\"humdrum lives, to rekindle that sense of wonder we remember from childhood,\\" he says. We crave hard evidence, scientific proof and its \\"seal of approval but are unwilling to put up with the rigorous standards of evidence that impart credibility to that seal.\\"<br /><br />The values of science, he claims, and that of democracy are nearly indistinguishable in that both require free exchange of ideas, debate and reason with standards of evidence and honesty. Which should be no great wonder, given America's Founders and their antecedents like Locke (a chemist) were scientists, including Jefferson. Sagan asks how a nation can maintain democracy when the source of that kind of thinking is lost with the loss of critical sagacity among its population?<br /><br />Sagan does not spare the opposite end of our educated spectrum, targeting postmodern philosophers who dismiss science as mythical and irrational; a Western bias with no relation to truth about nature. What these people seem never able to grasp is that science is both refutable (unlike religious claims) and testable against nature itself as the final judge. The predictions of quantum mechanics, Relativity theory or Newtonian gravitation can be verified by how semiconductors work, lasers, masers, orbiting galaxies, exploding stars and gravity waves. Because Newton, Einstein, Descartes or any other scientist held biases, bigotry, racist, sexist or unsavory political views is irrelevant to the accuracy of their scientific theories. We may not like them as people, but we successfully use their theories every day. Postmodern practice of dismissing their science because we don't like the scientist's politics is a recent and backward view incapable of separating politics from anything else. Atoms behave as atoms, and can be observed to do so whether one is Liberal or Conservative and 1 + 1 is still 2 whether one is religious or not. Saying it isn't because one doesn't like Bertrand Russell's proof of it as he was an atheist, or the racism of those who discovered how atoms behave does little more than expand ignorance and confirm membership of postmoderns to 95% of those scientifically illiterate.<br /><br />Though frightening, Sagan is honest and wonderful. Realization is the first step. Thank you, Carl.	2004-07-24

Who do you ballot-stuffing jerks think you're fooling?<br /><br />Furthermore, it seems the genius reviewer above me a) didn't notice the real name badge -- verified by credit card -- when he accused me of using a fictitious name, and b) didn't actually read what I said. I never said Cook's defenders here were paid shills or employees. I never said *all* of the negative reviews were lengthy or articulate. I never said *all* of the positive reviews were one-liners. Do you have a reading comprehension problem, Mr. Rogers? Do you honestly believe there's only one Amazon reader on Earth who thinks Wade is a swindling twerp?

The principles are sound, empirically verified and presented in a user-friendly fashion. The study skills review is good, as is the section on memory enhancement. What really makes this book stand out is the addition of an audio CD of relaxation and guided visualization exercises focused on reducing test and study related anxiety.

I had no reason to believe a biography would tell lies, esp. one that was allegedly as well-researched as Goldman claimed this one was.  Though Goldman's attempts to paint John and Yoko (as well as many other people in their lives) as these horrible horrible Satanic and psychologically messed up people failed; every negative trait of John's he gleefully wrote about, every shocking story, disgusting anecdote, vulgar practical joke, bad public behaviour, only made me love and admire him more.  I felt more and more that he really was just like everybody else, an ordinary human being with lots of flaws, someone even more heroic because he had to work so hard to overcome his sordid past and to bring his bad traits under serious control.  I was so naïve I couldn't even read between the lines in all of the many scenes attempting to portray John or one of his friends as bad people or fools, like the insinuation that Yoko set up Paul's 1980 drug bust in Tokyo, or the scene where Linda McCartney called someone (David Spinoza?) to come over and help them with the recording of 'Ram,' where Spinoza later gave a sneering account to 'Melody Maker' about how Paul didn't know the names of any of the chords he was playing and that therefore he was a bad musician.<br />Finding out most of this book was a lie was like finding out there's no Santa Claus or Tooth Fairy, since I'd believed and treasured these stories for years, feeling that they made John more admirable and heroic since he had to suffer and overcome so much.  Many of these stories are urban legends, like John and Brian Epstein in bed together in Spain, wildly exaggerated stories, unverified anecdotes, and just plain lies.  Albert Goldman is like the boy who cried wolf; even if he is telling the truth in some instances, you have to doubt it because he's lied so many times before and been exposed as a liar in those instances.  And there are an awful lot of times where Goldman depicts John as being alone, or with only one other person, like his Aunt Mimi or Yoko, and tells us all of the personal thoughts in his head.  How would he know this if John was alone and never wrote those thoughts down, or he never expressed what was on his mind to the other person he was with?<br />Still, it was lively reading, a real page-turner, and even though I'm disgusted I believed every last word, I still vividly remember a lot of it years later.  And it does provide a lot of details on Yoko's art shows and her custody battle for her daughter Kyoko, which most other biographers haven't had much information on.  It's not totally worthless.before and been exposed as a liar in those instances.

In 1943, the U.S. Navy intercepted word that Josef Stalin was going to sue for a separate peace with Adolf Hitler. They also discovered that Alger Hiss, a leading New Deal Democrat and top advisor to President Roosevelt, was a Soviet spy. In addition, numerous high-level Democrats in FDR's Administration were Soviet spies and \\"fellow travelers.\\" They approached FDR, whose response was \\"f--k off.\\" The Navy, during this time of greatest national security threat, reached the conclusion that the Democrats could not be trusted!  In response to this, they began the Venona Project, designed to read all the Soviet cable dispatches. Venona continued to confirm that the American government and society was rife with Soviet espionage from within the ranks of the anti-American Democrat Left.<br />When the war ended, the Republicans began to investigate these rumors. Richard Nixon asked FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to assist. Hoover told him he could not let him view Venona because it was too important to the on-going Cold War vs. Soviet Communism, but that Nixon's instincts, particularly about Hiss, were right. Hiss was convicted. Numerous Leftists were convicted or exposed, as were many in Hollywood. When McCarthy went after them, the Left attempted to discredit him. Venona would have justified him, but Hoover refused to disclose Venona's secret. McCarthy was sacrificed and allowed to twist in the end, and for decades the Left proffered the lie that there were no Communists in Hollywood, the government, the Army or in America. <br />After Ronald Reagan won the Cold War, Soviet archives were opened. Venona was discovered and became the Venona Papers. It verified that Hiss and all the accused and convicted Communists in Hollywood, the government, the Army and in America were in fact Soviet spies or \\"fellow travelers.\\" One of those fellow travelers had escaped to Russia, but returned when the Statute of Limitations ran out. He returned to the U.S. in 1996. He was asked why.<br />\\"To vote for Bill Clinton,\\" he replied.<br />Is further commentary really necessary?(...)	2004-07-14

When given a choice between watching some &quot;reality&quot; show versus reading about significant world events that can affect our lives, millions will chose who gets voted off the island versus understanding why Sept 11, 2001 happened. Kaplan digs deep into the real world, but would never reach the recognition rate of a tart who became famous for her disappearing cigar trick and became a &quot;star&quot; on her own &quot;reality&quot; show.<BR>What sets Kaplan apart from many of his fellow journalists is his hard work and sacrifice to get the story, enduring a lot of hardship to get to the real world as we never see it, and seldom read about. And his story is about the future of mankind instead of tabloid titillation which dominates the news, but is really the toilet paper of history. <BR>As someone who has traveled in many of the countries where Kaplan has developed his stories, I find his insightful observations and conversations with the real folk to put into perspective the superficial observations I have made, or read about from journalists who get the story from the comfort of their hotel rooms without ever getting their fingernails dirty. Even worse, his fellow journalists show up with their story already written and go home as soon as it is &quot;verified&quot; by talking to some propagandist, functionary, or peasant who fits their purposes. <BR>This is another very good book about the real world, including the vast disparity in the development of areas and peoples whose ancestors were the subjects of Marco Polo's travelogue. <BR>Americans can be very naive about the world, which is not surprising given the pitifully politically correct versions of history taught in all levels of schools today, but Kaplan has been there and experienced the world, with all its warts, and does a great job of putting it all into perspective. Like Polo's second excursion to Cathay, he went north and met the descendents of the same people who live in a world far closer to Polo's than the one we know today, seven hundred years later.<BR>While some of the events and people are changed from the book, it is a great book to understand the complexity of the forces dictating world events today in a very dangerous part of the world, the breeding grounds of the next phase of world conflict.	2004-07-11

His was such a contradictory life that biographers can easily read just about anything into it. He was somehow both monstrous and banal at the same time but was he a homosexual?<br />Machtan seems to think that he was. But what constitutes proof of such a claim? Hitler was a historical figure, much has been written about him even during his life. There is a wealth of documentation for just about every facet of his personality, his day to day existence as both a private and very public figure.<br /> So where's the proof? Machlan offers very little hard factual evidence that can be independently verified. Most of his proof are 'edited' interpretations of memoirs that are ambiguous at best. There just is no 'smoking gun' presented here just the same kind of innuendo that hints at everything and proves nothing.<br />Was Hitler a raging heterosexual then? No. He seems, to me, to have been more asexual then anything else. There was some sort of emotional 'relationship' between him and his niece.. was it a sexual one as well? Eva Braun ..kept carefully hidden from the German public.. was considered his sexual mistress by most of his closest companions...was that all just a cover? There is much more verifiable proof that his sexual drive was both heterosexual (and low). <br />So the thesis of this book? \\"Unproven\\" but probably not true is the best I can do. There are just too many blanks and too few hard facts given here to prove it.	2004-07-08

Brad Steiger is one of my favorite writers, and I have read many of his 160 published books, and enjoyed them all. In my opinion &quot;Alien Rapture&quot; is an excellent solid read, great plot, very interesting facts about black Top Secret technology and the Secret Government agency that pull the strings. It is also my opinion that this is one of his best works.<br />In &quot;Alien Rapture,&quot; our anti-hero, Joe Green is an ex-special ops veteran who is starting to make some hard choices in his life, in order to explain and come to grips with chunks of missing time in his life.  The ending packs a notable punch, causing this to be a successful novel and is currently being written into a screenplay for a potential movie. This is one of the few books I really want to see made into a movie. <br />Few as they may be, critics of this novel by and large have noted that the black technology noted in story must be fiction, therefore it weakens the factualness of the story. Nay I say, the co-author Ed Fouche, has been on the SF, Learning, Discovery channels, BBC channel 4 interviewed him in `Out of the Blue.' The Germans made a two hour special about the sightings of the ultra Top Secret TR-3B Astra flying triangle with half of it covering information from Fouche and his commentaries and many more. Search \\"Black Triangle\\" or \\"Flying Triangle\\" or \\"Edgar Fouche\\" on the net. Fouche's background has been verified over and over and unlike others, he's proven with his military records that he held Top Secret clearances and worked at Area 51.<br />These same uninformed critics have suggested that the `new' information in `Alien Rapture' is a `rehash' of old information. Again, do the research yourself. Two of the Majestic 12 - classified documents in the story were first released by Fouche and Steiger..., long before the so-called `Alien Autopsy' film, or the books by `USAF Colonel Corso or NASA's Dr. Paul Hill. <br />In the last ten years, ONLY four books-novels and their authors have stood the test of time with their shocking new information on the UFO cover-up.  Jim Marrs' \\"Alien Agenda,\\" Dr. Paul Hill's \\"Unconventional Flying Objects,\\" USAF Colonel Corso's \\"The Day After Roswell,\\" and Fouche-Steiger's \\"Alien Rapture.\\" All Highly recommended.	2004-07-05

He<BR>has admitted in print and on tv that the new mockumentary<BR>is full of falsehoods, not necessarily true parts, and yes,<BR>lacks a lot of facts.  Other than that, the 'documentary'<BR>is very truthful.  It's an opinion piece, well done for those<BR>who want to believe it.  But, considering the man has said<BR>repeatedly that Americans are stupid and dumb and ignorant,<BR>he made a movie aimed at that mentality.  I applaud  him on<BR>his capitalistic success.  <br />But, the book only points out the verified truth about Michael<BR>and his multi-corporate ties, millionaire profits, and his<BR>use and misuse of facts and truth to make a buck.  Jackass the<BR>movie made more money than Michaels movie, even after the 24/7<BR>public relations campaign the media lovingly gave him for over<BR>a month.  That doesn't say much for Michael does it?  He won<BR>an award in France not because the movie was good or great, but<BR>because it hated George W. Bush.  Prize for that.  Good.  He's<BR>had best selling books, but then so has Millie the dog, and <BR>Garfield the Cat and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and every<BR>diet expert in the world.  What does it mean?  <br />The book is reasonable, fact packed, and truthful.  If that's<BR>hard to take, then so be it.  Michael Moore is entitled to his<br />political opinion, but so is Mr. Hardy.  The only difference is<BR>that Hardy gives facts, and Michael Moore ignores them.  If it<BR>sells his opinion, he tosses the facts aside.  Anyway, why can't<BR>the opposition allow the freedom of speech to take place...or is<BR>that only a one way street?  Guess George Soros didn't buy out<BR>Amazon just yet....we'll give that time.   Billionaires and<BR>millionaires whining about corporate greed, kind of funny isn't it?  <br />As Michael gets on a private jet, or a private limo, and<BR>sends his kids to private school, and lives in a multi-million<BR>dollar home in New York...the average man alright.   The book<BR>tackles all of his work with a lot of humor and truth.  Two things Michael seems devoid of these days.<br />I recommend the book for anyone who wants to know more about<BR>Michael Moore's work, and his motivations, and also what he's<BR>willing to do to make his point:  avoid the truth.	2004-06-30

Since the author claims that many have said that his story is full of flaws but none have pointed to any specific flaws, I will point out a few of his flaws chosen at random and not completely I order.<BR>  <BR>\\"I ask you this, Dr. Blomberg. Do you not find it peculiar that a Christian bishop in Asia Minor, concerned with collecting and analyzing the sayings and deeds of the Lord (his lost writing was entitled The Sayings of the Lord Interpreted), would not possess a copy of any Gospel by the year 125?\\"<br /> A bishop in Anatolia didn't have copies of the gospels by the year 125 and that is supposed to somehow upset my faith?  It was not uncommon for early churches to lack New Testament writings.  Most early churches were still largely Jewish or steeped in Jewish tradition.  They typically preached from the Old Testament texts.  The church services of modern day Christian Jews still rely primarily on the Old Testament texts.  The Ethiopian Bible still does not have all the books of the New Testament.<br />\\"Well, Dr. Boyd, I just wish we were all as biased as the Seminar in rejecting the supernatural as authentic in the Gospels any more than it is authentic today. Considering that in our own lifetimes one would be hard pressed to point to any verified miracle or supernatural occurrence, and that science has increasingly uncovered a picture of a miracle-free and naturalistic universe,\\" <br /> What is \\"science\\"?  Is that the belief that the universe created itself from nothing completely on its own and that everything grew from a single living cell that miraculously appeared in a puddle of slush?  No respectable scientist believes in spontaneous generation.  No one was around to see that stuff which should make it more suspect than anything written during the entire expanse of human history, seems more like a system of faith to me.I have elaborated on the fallacies of evolution, or a Godless universe, see my personal xanga site.<br />\\"Considering that in our own lifetimes one would be hard pressed to point to any verified miracle or supernatural occurrence.\\"  Go to church and you will see all sorts of weird things that your \\"science\\" cant explain.  It just so happens I have seen miracles and acts of the supernatural but the point is that if you don't want to believe then it doesn't matter what I saw or how many other people saw it too because your mind is already set.   <br />\\"I suggest to the court that this is a very good presupposition to bring to the question of whether Western society in the 21st century should continue to govern itself by a set of writings that came out of far more primitive times and modes of thinking than our own.\\"<br />Last time I recalled the only country currently run by any kind of church was the Vatican, assuming that the set of writings referred to are the Bible.  Even taking that into account the Catholic Church interprets the Bible fairly liberally so it is not really a society ruled by ancient writings.  In western countries there are no laws stopping people from living a Godless lifestyle, so I do not see how the author can assert that a \\"set of writings\\" is governing him <br />\\"The Gospels contain testimony to one of the most blatant superstitions ever to trouble the mind, a belief in evil, inimical forces which actively seek to inflict harm and damnation upon human beings.\\"<BR>\\"Yet science has uncovered nothing which would lead us to believe that such forces exist. We are finally in a position to throw off that long and sorry bondage.\\"<br /> Superstition?  There are definitely malevolent spirits that seek to harm and frighten human beings and they are still active today.  I am still a college student (Georgia State University), but anytime the paranormal or supernatural will come up in any class there are always about 2 to 5 or 6 people that will claim that they have seen or been terrorized by spirits.  I have heard way too many accounts from people who have experienced such things.  People are bodily attacked sometimes, other times they hear inhuman voices chanting or screaming at them in alien languages.  Several times I have heard of peoples beds being dragged across the room while the person lies awake in terror being taunted or threatened by monstrous inhuman voices.  I have even heard cases where the evil spirits have frightened animals I have heard many of these accounts first hand, and second hand from both Christians and non-Christians, mostly from non-Christians.  The difference is that unbelievers tend to believe that the spirits are ghosts whereas Christians tend to believe they are demons.  <BR> Since the author believes that anything said by Christians is suspect (even though Christians believe that lying is a sin and most unbelievers do not) I will recommend that anyone who shares his belief ask questions of their fellow students or co-workers.  Also anyone who participates in any active internet communities may want to search for people who have seen these things because it is really surprising how many people see this stuff.  I suppose that \\"atheists\\" will instantly attribute this all to drug hallucinations or dementia.  That does not explain how people of all ages and walks of life see these things.  Furthermore most drug users are not going to report their drug hallucinations because they do not want it to become known that they are doing drugs and to report such things would be incriminating and result in immediate termination of their jobs or enrollment at a university.<br />I intend to give a more thorough critique of this book on my xanga site, keep watching for updates at [...]	2004-06-28

The authors explained that the sugars are missing in today's diet because of green harvesting, over processing, cooking, and preserving.  I decided to at least check out the information and give it a try.<br />After reading this book, I changed my diet to one that is closer to low glycemic and added glyconutrient supplements.  Before making the change, I asked my internist to do baseline blood work.  One month after making these changes, my blood work was checked again.  My triglycerides and total choesterol had dropped 35-40 points.  Within the next six weeks, the sun damaged skin on my forearms shed twice.  Because of a severe sunburn in 1984, I had been going to the dermatologist every six months for the last 10 years because of kerotosis and pre-cancer spots.  When I visited my dermatologist several months after improving my nutrition, he said my skin looked so good I wouldn't have to come back for a year.  The pre-cancer spot on my arm that he had been watching was almost normal in color and texture as the skin under my arm.  My internist verified my dermatologist's statements.  After 5 months of adding glyconutrients, my good cholesterol doubled.  My blood work continues to improve.  The arthritis in my thumb, elbow, and knee is gone.  <br />I just want to encourage others who may be suffering from similar ailments to read this book and make your own decision regarding improving your nutrition.  I for one am glad that Dr. Mondoa and Mindy Kitei took the time to research this new technology and share what they learned in easy to understand language.  I have recommended this book to my own doctors.  They have been interested in my progress and continue to monitor my health.  This should be a must read for all healthcare professionals.	2004-06-24

I have verified this by viewing the content page of &quot;Return to Neveryon&quot;.  While this is perhaps an unimportant detail, the search was sparked by the review below, and of course, my desire to find any other Samuel R. Delany (SRD) books about Neveryon (disappointed).  <br />However, the book is a satisfying conclusion to the four published texts in the series, perhaps beginning with &quot;Triton&quot;, mentioned briefly in one of the appendices as having a significant role in the development of what Delany (in the guise of an alter-ego K. Leslie Steiner) calles &quot;The Modular Calculus&quot;, a philosophical attempt to construct a measure of the degree of approach of a &quot;model of reality&quot; (that is, a book or series of books) to the &quot;reality&quot; itself.  Thus, one may infer that the entire Neveryon series and the book Triton, (only mentioned in passing in the appendix to the third book of the series &quot;Flight from Neveryon&quot;) is part of a philosophical musing by the author on the nature of society, civilization and the development and nature of the self, as demonstrated by various inhabitants of the &quot;model&quot; or fictional world he has created.  Despite these deeper philosophical conjectures, the book is a fascinating romp through what is perhaps, and perhaps not, an alternate world.  Enjoy!	2004-06-22
US	52822743	R2T8MTWAOX24S8	0898867525	968422722	An Outdoor Family Guide to Lake Tahoe (Outdoor Family Guides)	Books	3	15	15	N	N	excellent organiztion; somewhat outdated; lacks details	PROS: The organization of this book is outstanding. It has an overview map with location of each hike clearly marked by its number. It has a table of hikes with difficulty ratings, length, usage, and activities. It has brief summary of how to handle high altitute, ticks, bears, and mosquitos, and what to put into the backpack for a hike. Each hike comes with a little individual map. Each trail is rated as suitable for hiking, biking, or both. 58 trails described in the book is a very manageble number which makes choosing the right one easy. It is quite well described what to expect during the hike. It is the best organized book on hikes I have ever seen!!!<br />CONS: the information in the book is not always up-to-date; small details which could help you to find trailhead or the right turn are often not there; maps appear to be traced from topographic maps and are accurate, but show very little besides the trail and starting and final points. Very mathematical approach requires meticulous counting of distances. <br />PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: we took this book for a two-day weekend at Tahoe. On our first day, we decided to take trail #6 to Watson Lake. The book suggests taking unpaved Watson Lake Road and turn left on road 16N73C in 5.9 miles. In reality it turned out that the road is called &quot;Mt. Watson Rd.&quot;, that it is paved for at least 12 miles, that there are quite a few roads on the left, but none of them has sign &quot;16N73C&quot;. There are no hints in the book how to find the right road other than distance from the highway, and we of course did not realize that the distance was the only way to find that road. We were looking for a sign, missed the 5.9 miles reading, and then wasted 2 hours driving back and forth, but did not find the turn to the lake and gave up. <br />On the next day, we went for #16, Five Lakes Trail. The book suggests to drive on Alpine Meadows Road for 2.1 miles to the trailhead which is opposite to Deer Park Drive. We found Deer Park Drive 1.6 miles from the beginning of the road, were confused by why it is not 2.1 miles down the road, thought that perhaps it was a typo in the book, and spent 15 minutes looking for the trail - until we asked a local who told us that Deer Park Drive is a half-loop which intersects Alpine Meadows Road twice, here and half a mile down the road. <br />In both cases, we got a good deal of frustration. I will not repeat here what my wife said about this book and what she suggested to do with it! A good map could certainly help us - but we did not have one, and the maps in this book do not show anything except for the countour of the trail and the final destination - as a rule, neither landmarks along the trail nor intersecting trails are indicated. <br />BOTTOMLINE: If your family enjoys hiking with a GPS unit and a topographic map and loves the idea of counting 3.1 miles along the road, then another 2.7 miles after a turn, and you never forget to reset your trip meter after a turn when you are driving - you will get the most from this book and will love it. On the other hand, if you like to rely on verbal descriptions more than on accurate numbers and want a book that warns you that there are two crossings with Deer Park Drive and you should park at the upper one, or expect the book to describe what you will see when you arrive to an important turn to make you feel safe that you did not miss it, or if you like to see detailed maps or even fragments of topographic maps on one of the pages - then you may find this book very frustrating because the language it talks to you is not the language you expect to hear. It seems that instructions were very carefully verified against the map - but were not necessarily checked by real-life family hikers! A few more touches could've made this book really great. Maybe I was unfortunate to choose poorly described trails, or was not a kind of hiker that this book was written for - but I got my share of frustration which could beeasily prevented by just several words in the text. My advise - if you get this book, carefully track the distances, expect that some things written in the book do not match the reality, and keep a topographic map at hand - and you'll be fine.	2004-06-22

This book is truly an insult to anyone who bothers to look up the facts. The facts are that this book was written based on a document written by Douglas Feith, an aid to Dick Cheney and a staunch advocate for War with Iraq. Dick Cheney had an obsession and a deep desire to go to War with Iraq and in order to bolster his case he started his own little intelligence group because they didn't like what they were hearing from the intelligence community. Thus this little group cherry picked information that helped bolster their case, with one argument being they (Iraq) are connected to al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden. The document this book is largely based on was sent to the CIA. The CIA responded saying that none of this can be proven and a lot of it can be proven to be incorrect (such as a meeting in Prague). Regardless that didn't phase Cheney and co as they decided to still use the \\"facts\\" as \\"evidence\\" that there was a link. The reality is that the majority of the document was made up of \\"intelligence\\" that could only be verified by single sources, some of whom had an interest in getting the United States inside of Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein (such as Ahmed Chalabi).<br />If you are going to read this book then at least go check your facts... they are widely available and perhaps you will actually learn something. Otherwise I wouldn't give this book 10 minutes of my time.	2004-06-22

I cannot emphasize enough that Mr BeauSeigneur lacks almost completely a true understanding of prophesied events and therefore must rely on his significant talents as an imaginative writer to incorporate the scriptures into this self-proclaimed work of fiction.  Having said that I must admit I enjoyed the series  because of its fast-paced and suspenseful nature but also because of some of his insights into the root necessity for the Tribulation and particularly his descriptions of the raw experience of some of the plagues, most notably his interpretation of the fifth vial plague.  In   Rev.16:10-11 it says:<BR>v.10  And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,<BR>v.11  And blasphemed YAHOWAH of Heaven because of their pains and sores, and repented not of their deeds.<BR>     BeauSeigneur interprets this darkness comparable to the darkness that was one of the plagues of Egypt and I'm not sure if that is what it means but his description is so great it bears quoting.  \\"Decker\\" is someone who has not repented to YAHOWAH but he hasn't taken the mark of the beast either and he wakes up to an inexplicable fear,<BR>     \\"Drawn by the light, Decker rose from his bed to open the window.  But as he looked out from his second-floor bedroom, the faceless terror that had awakened him took on a loathsome and ghastly form.  Seeping upward out of the ground below his window and everywhere he could see, a hideous evil oozed like black puss, obscuring everything it covered.  In only seconds it grew from simple puddling in the low-lying areas to a depth that obscured the ground completely.  Decker's curiosity, normally one of his strongest drives, was utterly silenced by the stark panic that consumed him.  He did not want to know what the darkness was; hedid not need to know.  He knew already.  It was evil ---the sum total of all the evil that had been done upon the earth----every murder, every lie, every rape, every torture, every act of cannibalism, every beating of an innocent, every human sacrifice, every brutal mutilation of a child, every gulag, every pogrom, every death camp of every war, every slaughter of the blameless, every cruelty to a helpless animal, every destructive act upon the earth itself,  All of it had been absorbed and held in by the earth until it could be held no longer, and now it gushed forth like nefarious vomit.\\" <BR>     No wonder YAHOWAH says \\"the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now, and not only they but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.  For we are saved by hope........\\"  Romans 8:22-24<BR>    The next few pages describe the unimaginable torment and terror which accompanies the blackness.  Though no outside force attacks or threatens it is the very darkness itself that feeds the imagination to the point of paralysis.  I saw a woman on TV once who had experienced a \\"near death\\" event where she had wound up in hell.  She described the torturing demons, the unrelenting screams and the fear and darkness but she said nothing compared or could describe the absolute horror of the utter hopelessness.  She said there was nothing that could torture the human soul more than an eternal and complete absence of hope.  The darkness described in Exodus and here is one of complete absence of light and we know from YAHOWAH's Word that light is truth and that YAHO-Hoshu-WAH is the Way the Truth and the Light.  He is our hope and salvation.  Without Him we have no hope only darkness.  BeauSeigneur continues:<BR>     \\"When the darkness subsided after three days, its black murkiness seeping back into the earth just as it had arrived, Decker found himself lying on his bed unharmed.  Dried feces lay smeared on the bed around him and caked on his hips and back.  The room stank from the feces, urine, and sweat, but having been in the room with it for so long, he did not smell it.<BR>    There was no thought of getting up to wash.  Now that he no longer feared to move, he did not have the strength to do so.  His jaws and teeth and head ached so badly from three days and nights of clenching and grinding that he was not certain he would survive the pain.  Gently he moved his tongue along the inside of his cheeks trying to assess the damage.  Loose flaps of flesh and deep ulcers revealed the pieces he had unknowingly bitten off in his torment.  His tongue, too, was badly gnawed, and he could only assume the missing bits of flesh lay scattered around him on the bed or had been swallowed, washed down by the warm blood that still seeped from the wounds.\\"<BR>     Powerful stuff.<BR>     If you are looking for a biblically accurate and historically verified version of the true story of the cloning of the Messiah please email me at b.jeanpearce@shaw.ca	2004-06-20

US	50702879	R2CLJC19PJGWSS	159059181X	122186246	J2ee Performance Testing	Books	4	12	12	N	Y	A good introduction	In the last decade, the performance of J2EE applications has become of monumental importance in enterprise industries that use these applications. With the complexity of J2EE applications increasing every year, it is crucial that users of these applications be presented with a level of performance that is acceptable to them, this performance usually codified in the ubiquitous \\"response time.\\" The authors of this book have given a good introduction of how to deal with performance issues in WebLogic applications and have discussed a freely available tool, called Grinder, which allows load-generating and data collection. The book though can be read with respect to any load-generating tool, such as Mercury LoadRunner, etc. Even though Grinder is free, it may take time for enterprise users to trust it in testing and modeling.<br /> After a brief introduction to what the book is all about, the authors begin in chapter 1 with discussion on a testing methodology for doing performance studies of J2EE applications, which they hope will be generic enough for all readers. Their methodology boils down to first defining the performance metrics for the application, and then setting a target for the metrics. Test scripts that accurately simulate the application usage must then be obtained, and the statistical sampling method and metrics must then be defined. The authors emphasize the need for a realistic `usage profile' for the application, and they recommend strongly a fixed number of users per test run, with subsequent runs changing the number of users. They do not give quantitative reasons for not varying the number of users, but merely say that such an approach is \\"statistically incorrect.\\"<br />They also point out the need for including \\"think times\\" between the executions of each request in a script, asserting that the think times will have a very dramatic effect on the observed response times and throughput for a given user load. They are correct in this claim, as testing and modeling studies will show, and they give examples of this in chapter 4 of the book. In addition, they remark that the attempt to simulate more users by decreasing the think time, with the assumption that the resulting data can be then extrapolated to obtain the performance at real think times. They point out, correctly, that applications do not scale linearly over different time scales, and that the application and Web servers, the database server, and the operating system do not interact the same way with different user loads. Performance testers and modelers have verified them time and time again, and so it is beneficial for a reader who might be new to the field to see the case studies illustrating this included in the book.<br />The authors discuss two sampling methods in the book, namely the `cycle' method, and the `snapshot' method. Defining a cycle as a complete execution of a test script by a simulated user, each user will thus execute every request in the script once. Increasing the number of cycles will result in more meaningful statistics, but the time to run a large number of cycles might be too prohibitive. The snapshot method involves capturing the data for a specified period of time.<br />It is rare to see in books at this level a statement that acknowledges the difficulty in the mathematical or simulation modeling of Internet traffic. The authors though are cognizant of this difficulty, and give some brief suggestions on how to simulate the Internet in a test environment.<br />The authors also devote a fair amount of time discussing how to assess the accuracy of the test results. The authors report that variability of up to 50% on the performance testing of applications has been observed, and so they propose a measurement of \\"quality\\" for the sample data. This is defined as the standard deviation divided by the arithmetic mean, and when close to zero indicates high quality in the sample data. A value above 0.25 for the quality they take as a signthat the tests are not reproducible, and they therefore encourage the running of more cycles of the test in order to pin down the origins of this non-reproducibility. They define a \\"load factor\\" to better quantify this, which they define in terms of an \\"aggregate\\" average response time. Plotting this quantity versus the number of cycles gives some information on a bad quality indicator.<br />Frequently, application development using J2EE requires that the impact of design changes or proposals on application performance must be understood. The authors address how performance can be impacted in the context of building servlet applications. The dynamic nature of servlet applications entails that special measures be taken to maximize the performance of the application. The authors discuss how to choose a session mechanism that will preserve the session in user requests, and how to manage the servlet thread pool. Other helpful hints are given on how to increase performance, such as making sure that the auto-reload feature of servlets is disabled in a production environment. In testing the servlet API, the authors choose the snapshot method of data collection, and used zero think times as a baseline, since the real think times are unknown. They use WebLogic Server 6.1 in this discussion however, which makes their presentation somewhat dated, since WebLogic is now in version 8.1. The authors also test the performance when the WebLogic performance pack is activated, for both the average response time and the transactional rate. Also studied is the cost of maintaining HTTP logs, an issue that is very important for those businesses who must keep these logs, either for advertising purposes or other reasons. By running tests, the authors conclude, as expected for those readers who have managed Web servers, that the keeping of log files can have a considerable impact on performance, for a high number of users. The effects of the size of the response generated by the test servlet is also studied, along with the effects of using HTTP 1.0 versus HTTP 1.1.sign that the tests are not reproducible, and they therefore encourage the running of more cycles of the test in order to pin down the origins of this non-reproducibility.

For years we've heard people saying that Atheism is a religion, that atheists need to have faith not to believe in gods and other silly phrases derived from the believers' own belief structure. <br />This book goes exactly that way. You would think that religious authors should have moved on by now, leaving us atheists live happy, productive lives free of mythology, but no... here we go again. I don't know of any atheist ever converted after reading an apologetics book, but that doesn't stop authors from writing yet another one, right? This is because apologetics authors are not writing for atheist but for people who are already believers!<br />I know I'm probably wasting my time, but I'll try to show you how an atheist thinks. If you can follow my reasoning, you'll see why this book is flawed. <br />It doesn't take any belief, much less faith, to be an atheist, it just takes curiosity about the world around us. <br />What defines us, atheists, is that we lack the faith to believe in gods. Any gods. The difference may seem semantic, but it's not, it's real: there's no evidence supporting the claim that somewhere a god exists, upon further review one is not even necessary for the world to be as we know it, I don't have faith to fill the gap between the evidence I see and the claim that somewhere there's a creator, a god watching our every move, thus, I have no reason to accept there's a god.<br />In the same way I don't believe there are four giant turtles holding the four corners of the world neither do I believe in the Easter Bunny, Allah, Jesus, Zeus, Santa Claus, Poseidon... <br />When people try to \\"convert\\" me, most of the time all they do is read a passage of the Bible... a book which holiness you really have to believe to ignore its serious and contradictions. Am I supposed to be converted because somebody wrote a line in a book said to be holly? First prove me there's a god, then that this particular god wrote (or commanded to write) this particular book. Don't just show me the book!<br />Believers say we're blind to the evidence which, after all, is in the Bible... It is not like being blind... On the contrary, sometimes I feel that we have our eyes wide open while most believers, rather than face the evidence contradicting their holy books and doctrines, chose to close theirs. <br />Lack of belief is not a physical shortcoming like blindness. Belief is! Skepticism is the critical light under which we need to examine every claim!<br />I believe in nothing. My view of the world is formed by things, events and facts that can be verified one way or another. <br />\\"But you have to believe in something!\\" <br />Why? Christians and other religious people were taught that every time we lack an explanation for a natural fact we must assume a supranatural cause. This goes for the creation of the world, the existence of man, the universe, etc. etc. <br />Rather than jump to conclusions, atheists prefer to investigate the claim and find a rational, verifiable solution. If there's none, we're better off working with a likely theory than assuming that a supranatural power did it. <br />If new evidence appears... we are ready change our view of the world and move on. Most people don't like this, they prefer a firm, constant, permanent view of the world... this may seem as shaky ground, but it not, and we like to think we learn as we go.<BR> <BR>Variable as it may seem, the world doesn't change that much. Punctuated equilibria instead of steady evolution? Sure, makes sense. Evolution still holds, perhaps the timing or the process was slightly different. But no reason to discard the basic idea. Unless a better explanation comes along.  <br />You'll find honest scientists discussing whether evolution followed a more or less steady pace or whether major environment changes forced abrupt changes followed by periods of evolutionary calm. Humans as we are, some may be more attached to their original theories than others' theories. But nobody would argue a scientific position from a belief standpoint. <br />Which takes me to the point of \\"good science v. bad science\\", other of the pillars trying to hold this book together... who decides what is good or bad science? Well, the authors think that anything that fits the Bible is good, whatever doesn't is bad... when in fact there's not a single scientific evidence supporting any of the supranatural claims of the Bible! Genesis? Young earth? Flat earth? Giants roaming the Earth? Flood? Virgin birth? Resurrection? Talking bushes? Miracles? <br />You pick up the topic, science always points the other way... <br />The scientific process is based on peer review, which means that scientists check each other's work continuously. If something can't be replicated, then it's back to the drawing board. Peer-reviewed science is good science. Interpreting the natural world in accordance to the Bible is bad science...  <br />So we believe in science? No... we don't believe in science. It is the process that brings a critical review of every claim and for that reason we apply it to everything. But it's not a belief, it's an always evolving process. It's a method. You don't believe in methods, do you?<br />But this is another flaw in the book... the belief that Atheists believe in science (bad science, by the way, according to the authors). <br />Based on their belief structure, religious people assume that if we don't believe in any god, we must believe in Science, Atheism, Evolution, The Big Ameba, the Big Bang or whatever. The fact is, atheists don't believe, they take whatever evidence there is and construct their view of the world. Do I believe in evolution? No... but I have seen proof of it, so I don't need to believe, it's there for everyone to see. <br />The problem with apologetics books, as I said before, is that they are mostly written for the Christian public. I know this after having read most of the main apologetics books out there, given to me over the years by friends and family. No author ever tried to think like an atheist. If apologetics authors were to write from an atheist perspective, they would confuse their readers and their books would be complete commercial failures. <br />This book is flawed in the sense that the authors, while trying to show how atheists think, can't leave behind years of thinking like Christians. Which is probably good for them, but bad for the book. <br />It is good for them because if Christians were to start from a blank slate thinking about the world they see, most smart ones will probably arrive to the same conclusion millions of atheists arrived before: no evidence, no need to believe, no need for a god, much less proof of the Christian religion. Apologetics books would have exactly the opposite effect...	2004-06-16

They are ignoring the single most striking thing in this book.  They have failed to notice an elephant in the refrigerator.  They peek behind the elephant in order to get a slice of American cheese, and they have failed to take stock of the elephant.<br />This book says that nearly all of us are possessed by evil spirits who answer to Lucifer.<br />One problem with hypnosis as a tool for uncovering hidden truths is that the hypnotist can lead the subject.  The subject doesn't know if what he is seeing and reporting is true.  It might be coming from the imagination.  And any leading questions by the hypnotist can take the subject on quite a ride.<br />For example, if I hypnotized you and then asked you if you were possessed by Satan, perhaps you would say yes, perhaps you would say no.  But you don't know.  Your imagination picks up the ball and runs with it.<br />I would have to see the actual transcripts before I could even entertain the possibility that the author's central tenet is worth considering.  And I would have to take a peek at the room, and interview the subjects to determine their preconceptions.  On the face of it, this seems absurd.  It reminds me of Salem, Massachussetts.  Time to start burning the witches again.<br />I believe that this book is well-intentioned but misguided superstition and fear.<br />I strongly recommend the works of Michael Newton.  He is another hypnotist.  I suspect that his techniques are more pristine, less suggestive.  His clients report that spirit possession is probably impossible - thousands of his clients have said they never saw any evidence of it.  Not one of his clients reported one case of spirit possession.<br />Further, his clients have never verified any contact with a Biblical character, not Lucifer, not Satan, not Beelzebub, not Beetlejuice, not Caspar the friendly ghost.  Guess what - those characters are in the realm of fiction.<br />BOO!!!  Did I scare ya?  This book is medieval.This book is medieval.	2004-06-15

Gravity has been experimentally verified.  Atomic forces are govered by quantum mechanics, which requires that space-time is bumpy, foamy, and irregular.  These atomic forces have been experimentally verified.<br />How can space time be smooth for gravity, and yet be bumpy for quantum machanics?  Enter string theory.<br />This book is a terrific introduction not only to string theory, but to relativity and quantum mechanics as well.  The first half of the book reviews the history and development of these theories, since they are a fundamental component  of string theory.  In particular, Greene's treatment of relativity uses some outstanding analogies to explain time dilation and gravitational warping.  I thought I understood the basics of relativity; this book still taught me a few things.<br />Analogies are this author's strength.  He uses them at every step to avoid the need to complex mathematical formulae.  There are no formulae in this book (some will think that a minus, but I view it as a plus.)  Using analogies, he's able to provide a comprehensible view of what 10-dimensional spacetime would be like, and how expanding one of the other dimensions might affect life in the Universe.  These 5 pages alone are probably worth the price of the book.<br />If you want a glimpse of one of the cutting-edge areas of particle physics research without needing to study math for 10 years, this book can give it to you.	2004-06-15

Dr. Ross:  \\"Most believe that if they're wrong on the age of Earth, the basis for their Christian faith - the truth of the Bible - is invalidated.  Thus, most young-earth creationist leaders remain convinced that the overwhelming scientific evidence for an ancient earth and universe must be false.  They can give no ground.  To accept the scientific signs of age, might, in their own words, start them 'down a slippery slope' toward apostasy.\\"<br />Perhaps what the young-earth creationists don't realize, however, is that their obstinacy is a liabilty to the Christian message.  It's quite clear - from exegetical study and historical interpretation - that the word \\"day\\" in Genesis could refer to 24-hour periods or long (but finite) periods of time.  Both are \\"literal\\" interpretations, given that the Hebrew language has a much more limited vocabulary than English.  Sometimes we just have to admit we are wrong about certain things, even specific interpreations of the Bible.  Think of the many passages of the Bible that are difficult to translate properly.  That doesn't mean, of course, that any interpreation is valid or that Biblical truth cannot be known.  It does mean, however, that our interpretation may need to be adjusted if we are wrong.  Also, it certainly isn't true that the young-earth interpretation has been the only one since the dawn of Christianity.<br />Perhaps one fear of admitting an old earth is is the parallel one might think it has to accepting macroevolution.  In one respect, old earth people are saying that scientists are absolutely right about the age of the earth and universe, but then deny that they are right about macroevolution and common decent.  There are quite a few differences, however:  first of all, one definition of evolution is certainly not disputed - the fact of \\"change over time\\" in biological systems and  variation and adaption are real.  However, one segment of evolutionary theory - mainly that of \\"macroevolution\\" and \\"common decent\\"is certainly an extrapolation and does not have a proven mechanism.  This area of evolution is certainly not universally accepted, nor is it comparable to the empircal observations that astronomers, physicists, geologists, etc have seen regarding the age of the earth and universe.  Someone who challenges macroevolution may be standing on solid ground, but those who deny an old earth and universe clearly are not... they must reject nearly all of scientists observations in order to hold to their view.<br />Also, science (and scientists) cannot be our enemy.  It is clear that the Bible and science are NOT mutually exclusive.  If we interpret the Genesis account as long periods of time, then many scientific advances clearly support the Bibilical account and the evidence can be used to point unbelievers to God's creation and His Word.  Certainly, some questions remain no matter which view you hold.  We don't have absolute knowledge of God, the universe, or His Plan.<br />Dr. Ross outlines many Biblical passages that are clearly in agreement with the findings of science:<br />- Second Law of Thermodynamics (entropy<BR>- The Big Bang<BR>- Expansion of the universe<br />I think he offers the best advice when he says we should test both views and make predictions that will allow us to evaluate them over time.  If the young-earth believers are right, then evidence should begin to overturn scientists estimates of the age of the universe.  However, as we are seeing in recent times, age estimates are getting much more accurate and can be independant verified by many direct and indirect methods.  Truly we must admit that holding on the young-earth position not only forces one to discard clear evidence and truth, but it also hinders the spread of the Gospel when unbelievers turn away from us.<br />Dr. Ross does repeat himself quite a bit in this book, which might be a minor complaint.  He seems very anxious to end this controversy, and rightly so.	2004-06-15

Hahn & Meeker's discussion of how to interpret various intervals--confidence, tolerance, prediction--first opened my eyes to the ubiquity and utility of these techniques.  I since have found it worthwhile to have a working knowledge of them all; that would scarcely have been possible without having such a handy reference.<br /><br />The tables are getting dog-eared and gray from use, especially A-12 (factors for computing Normal distribution one-sided tolerance bounds), in testimony to the frequency I refer to them.  The book also contains extensive graphics for estimating intervals and for determining sample sizes: these typically obviate any need to refer to tables or do the computations.  There are some neat formulas, clearly described, that one can easily implement in a spreadsheet.  These all appear in other texts and journal articles, but having them all in one place, well organized, makes them particularly worthwhile.<br /><br />This is, indeed, a reference: a statistical \\"cookbook\\" if you will (intended in a positive sense, not pejoratively!).  This means you will find little theoretical justification for any of the material.  For each technique expect to find a clear definition, lucid descriptions, discussions of how to use any supporting formulas, graphs, or tables, all followed by a clear worked example.  Of course there's an extensive bibliography if your theoretical curiosity is piqued.<br /><br />One common technique you will not find (although it is mentioned and references provided) is computing statistical intervals for linear regression analysis.  This subject, however, is covered well in other books (such as Draper and Smith's Applied Regression Analysis), so the omission does no harm and helps keep the book to a manageable 400 pages or so.<br /><br />There are some obscure applications you will not find, in part because they were only under development at the time this book was written.  For instance, there is a specialized (but widely applied) theory of \\"k best of m\\" prediction limits that is used in groundwater monitoring.  For such specialized applications you will have to go elsewhere (such as Robert Gibbons' book on \\"Statistical Methods for Groundwater Monitoring\\").  Nevertheless, Hahn and Meeker do a very good job of covering the most widely used applications of statistical intervals.<br /><br />I do not recollect ever finding a mathematical error or even a typographical error.  Over the years I have also checked, and completely verified, the entries in several of the key tables.  All in all, this book is remarkably clean and error free.<br /><br />(This review is based on the 1991 edition; I do not know whether there have been further editions.)they were only under development at the time this book was written.

US	49163407	R37DB4M4BDDI0P	9042015152	982781324	The Republic of Science: the Emergence of Popper's Social View of Science (Series in the Philosophy of Karl R.: Popper and Critical Rationalism) ... R. Poppers Und Des Kritischen Rationalismus)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	The rules of the game of science	This book should put an end to the view that Popper's philosophy of science can usefully be summed up by the label &quot;falsificationism&quot;, a view that has been perpetuated even by commentators as well informed and sympathetic as Alan Chalmers in What is this thing called Science? Popper expounded a critical method, with five forms of criticism.<br />1. The check on the problem. Does the theory solve the problem?<br />2. The check of logic. Is the theory internally consistent?<br />3. The check of consistency with other well-tested theories.<br />4. The check of evidence, falsifiability (if this is appropriate).<br />5. The check on the metaphysics.<br />The focus in this book by Jarvie is check 4, the use of evidence, although this is just the point of departure and the destination is much more interesting.<br />Jarvie argues strenuously that Popper's first major work in early 1930s can be interpreted to anticipate the social turn in the philosophy of science. This may be called the strong version of his thesis, by analogy with the strong program in the sociology of science. A weaker version of Jarvie?fs thesis, which is equally fruitful but possibly less controversial, is that Popper should be regarded as a conventionalist in scientific methodology (not to be confused with conventionalism as a theory of truth). Jarvie has argued convincingly that the decisive achievement of Logik der Forschung was to show the indispensable function of methodological conventions as rules of the game in science. This mirrors Popper?fs approach to political philosophy; as the function of the philosophy of science is to formulate and criticize the rules of the game of science, so the function of moral and political philosophy is to do the same for the rules of the game of social and political life. These rules may be unwritten conventions, mores and folkways, traditions, laws of the land and institutions of all kinds.<br />The Introduction to the book, Science as an Institution, sets out the major issues in the complex relationship between science and society that Jarvie hopes to illuminate. The word science of course has many different uses and discussion can easily be confused by conflating two or more of the meanings. Science may refer to a body of public knowledge; a set of beliefs about the world; the whole range of activities performed by scientists; some subset of those activities that are supposed to be special to science; the social and political institutions that influence the activities of scientists. Jacques Barzun wrote a particularly valuable book with the title Science: The Glorious Entertainment. Jarvie is clearly aware of the nuances of the topic and he surveys various approaches to it, including the positivist and falsificationist demarcation principles and Merton's sociological account of the distinguishing features of scientific knowledge.<br />Chapter 1 unpacks the hidden elements of the social turn in Popper's early philosophy of science. The key concept here is the need for rules of the game in science and these constitute what Jarvie calls the proto-constitution of science. This is the foundation of his project and he spells out this constitution in some detail, drawing from The Logic of Scientific Discovery (originally Logik der Forschung, 1935). In the following chapters he works through the evolution of Popper's thoughts over the decade from 1935 to 1945 to show how his views on science and society developed to the point they reached in The Poverty of Historicism and The Open Society and its Enemies.<br />The second chapter of Jarvie's book is called Popper's 1935 Proto-Constitution for the Republic of Science. This contains a list with Popper's supreme or meta-rule (SR) and 14 subsidiary rules (R1 to R14), which constitute the rudimentary scaffolding for Popper's republic of science.<br />SR: The other rules of scientific procedure must be designed in such a way that they do not protect any statement in science against falsification.<br />R1: The game of science is, in principle, without end. He who decides one day that scientific statements do not call for any further test, and that they can be regarded as finally verified, retires from the game.<br />R2: Once a hypothesis has been proposed and tested, and has proved its mettle, it may not be allowed to drop out without 'good reason'.<br />The &quot;supreme rule&quot; and the first two subsidiary rules were proposed by Popper, then Jarvie has identified additional rules that can be found scattered in the text of Popper's book.<br />R3: We are not to abandon the search for universal laws and for a coherent theoretical system, nor ever give up our attempts to explain causally any kind of event we can describe.<br />R5: Only those auxiliary hypotheses are acceptable whose introduction does not diminish the degree of falsifiability or testability of the system in question but, on the contrary, increases it.<br />R9: After having produced some criticism of a rival theory, we should always make a serious attempt to apply this criticism to our own theory.<br />And so on.<br />Jarvie's commentary on the constitution begins with the reminder that it is very incomplete. He notes also that it is very abstract, as thought the whole of science is a kind of debating society, leaving out of account a great deal of gritty reality, such as the question of leadership in the decision-making that is inevitably required, including decisions about adding to the constitution or revising it.<br />One of the implications of the social turn described by Jarvie is that the nature of objectivity is radically shifted. It ceases to be a problem for individual scientists, requiring that they be unbiased, rational and free from preconceptions. It becomes a situational or institutional problem, calling for such things as theoretical pluralism, clear formulation of the problems that the theories are supposed to solve, the design of critical experiments, the existence of journals, seminars and conferences to facilitate critical discussion. Some of these requirements need to be provided by individual scientists, especially new ideas and imaginative criticism; others call for institutions, including political institutions, to protect the autonomy of the journals and the research institutes.falsification.<br />R1: The game of science is, in principle, without end.

All three represent the lowest end of malware, with spam occupying a particularly disdainful place in the computer security hierarchy.  I wasn't very excited when a review copy of &quot;Anti-Spam Tool Kit&quot; (ASTK) arrived in the mail, but I found myself drawn in by the value of the content and tools it described.  I highly recommend anyone tasked with fighting spam read ASTK.<br />This book is the first to follow in the genre defined by &quot;Anti-Hacker Tool Kit.&quot;  While AHTK examined tools used by intruders and defenders, ASTK focuses on tools and techniques to counter unwanted email.  AHTK has slightly more coverage of Windows than UNIX applications; ASTK spends more time on Windows, especially with client configurations.  As a desktop FreeBSD user, I still found plenty of helpful information.<br />Since I'm not directly responsible for enterprise anti-spam defenses, ASTK's comparison of the many block lists was particularly enlightening.  Prior to reading ch 5 I knew of many lists but not their particular capabilities.  I found the coverage of SpamAssassin in chs 6-8 fairly thorough.  Ch 14's overview of email and headers very helpful.  I had not heard of server-based greylisting until reading ch 15.<br />I found a few of the authors' comments odd.  On p. 250 they claim &quot;most organizations do not run UNIX-based email solutions.&quot;  I find this difficult to believe, but no proof for the statement is given.  Figure 2.2 in ch 2 shows a mail sender using POP/POP-SSL/IMAP/IMAP-SSL to send email.  At least using Mozilla and Firefox on UNIX, I connect to my ISP's SMTP server to send email and then retrieve it with POP or IMAP.  In ch 3 the authors advocate IPv6 because it makes &quot;a spammer's identity known and verified even if he or she doesn't want it to be.&quot;  IPv6 should not change many, or any, spammer tactics.  Spammers aren't forging TCP sessions with IPv4 now; they forge information (headers, etc.) transferred within application layer data.  I believe some of these weird comments could have been addressed by more diligent technical editing.<br />Overall, I found ASTK enlightening and practical.  The authors give enough details on various server- and client-side tools to make implementation (at least on a trial basis) possible.  I look forward to other tool-related books in the &quot;Anti-Hacker&quot; series.(headers, etc.) transferred within application layer data.

Huanchu Daoren was reputed to have been a layman past the age of 60- the time of retirement from public affairs and the closing season of life. Yet one gets the sense that he had been preparing himself for this detachment, practicing it as best he could, for all of his life. As he puts it, retire when you are at the height of your career- and count yourself as a survivor. For this is a book on how to live the most simple, pure, and genuine life even when surrounded by power, wealth, and chaos. It shows how to move among the powerful, the vicious, and the ignorant without losing your center. It even points the Way towards clearing your mind in order to find this center. Once found, the sage is imperturbable. Indeed, the sage is the nucleus around which harmony and natural order coalesce in the human realm.<br />There is an incredible wealth of concentrated wisdom here, verified and filtered by the ages:<br />When the rich and well established, who should be generous, are instead spiteful and cruel, they make their behavior wretched and base in spite of their wealth and position. When the intellectually brilliant, who should be reserved, instead show off, they are ignorant and foolish in their weakness in spite of their brilliance.<br />&quot;Always leave some food for the mice; pity the moths and don't light the lamp.&quot; Thoughts like these that the ancients had are the living, life-giving mechanism of us humans. Without this, we are no more than statues or manikins.<br />When enlightened people are so poor that they cannot help others, if they speak a word to awaken the confused or to resolve a problem, there is also boundless merit in that.	2004-06-07

James Ellroy's forward to this book gives the impression that he has swallowed Hodel's cockamamie Dahlia theory whole. But Ellroy gave an interview in the LA Times just before this paperback came out, saying he that is sure that Hodel's photographs are not Elizabeth Short and that he doesn't believe a bit of Hodel's police cover-up conspiracy theory, either.<br />These two things are the bedrock of Hodel's case!  The photos, supposedly from his father's special photo album, are what Hodel says started his whole investigation.  They are the only verifiable (not to say verified!) link between Hodel's father and Short. And the elaborate police cover up, to which Hodel devotes many tedious pages, is needed to explain why, despite the senior Hodel's \\"obvious\\" guilt, he was never arrested and was in fact cleared of any connection to the crime.<br />Without the photos or the cover up, what's left?  A lucky guess?<br />Combine that with Ellroy's statement in the book's forward that he has \\"chosen to believe\\" that archival film of Los Angeles on V-J Day shows footage of Short, despite the fact that she is known to have been on the other side of the county at the time, and I really have to wonder what is going on in Ellroy's head. I bet it's not any prettier that what is going on in Hodel's.	2004-06-05

In that time, she had the opportunity to research and discover many a bizarre and odd fact. However, one of the most frequent requests was that of finding a favorite poem or author. It is out of this experience that she collected the works in this volume, The Best Loved Poems of the American People, published in 1936. She said she used this sampling of people's preferences rather than her own in collecting the works in this volume. Of course, today we would know that the readership of the New York Times is a fairly specific subset of the American people, not necessarily fairly representative of the whole, and those who write to the New York Times are yet an even more rarified subset. In any case, this is a good collection drawn from a widely cast net of inquiries.<br />Felleman put the poems in categories thematically. These are the broad themes of the book:<br />+ Love and Friendship<br />+ Inspiration<br />+ Poems that Tell a Story<br />+ Faith and Reverence<br />+ Home and Mother<br />+ Childhood and Youth<br />+ Patriotism and War<br />+ Humor and Whimsey<br />+ Memory and Grief<br />+ Nature<br />+ Animals<br />+ Various Themes<br />There are a lot of poems here with Unknown listed for the author, verses rather famous but either not attributed to any particular person, or attributed to too many people, the true origin of which could not be verified.<br />These are not all American poets. These are poems that Americans love, so naturally there are many poets from the British side, and various poems from other languages that have been translated into English. Wordsworth, Byron, Arnold, Tennyson, Burns and Kipling figure prominently. Heine, von Logau, Nadaud, and Rueckert make an appearance in translation.<br />In the nearly 650 pages of the book are as many poems as pages, including such famous pieces as Sonnet from the Portuguese -- the first poem -- and Paul Revere's Ride to relatively unknown pieces (today). I've read a lot of poetry, and always have a book of poetry as one of my reading pieces, but nearly a quarter of the poems in here I'd never seen or heard before.<br />Perhaps that is the value of this book. It is a snapshot of the popular poems of the time between world wars. Poems sometimes go out of favor, and thus are no longer continued. Popular jingles and lyrics may be well known for a time, and then forgotten. I think the editions of the Oxford Book of English Verse are similar in this regard, that each edition captures popular and timeless in a delicate balance. Felleman wasn't going to timeless here, but rather popular. I found this was especially true in the Humor and Whimsey section.<br />One criticism of the book is that there is editing going on without being made explicit. The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe is actually a fairly long poem, and yet here we only get a few pages of judiciously selected stanzas, keeping the flow of the narrative in the poetry, but not giving us any indication that there was an omission.

Very practical, and offers enough examples to get the hang of it in most cases. <br />However, the egregious number of serious errors in the book (in a 4th edition?!) can often be frustrating if not misleading. Some errors are misstatements of theorems or errors in the worked problems! Others include mislabeled graphs, incorrect PROBLEMS (yes!), incorrect answers etc. Believe, me, I've spent hours checking my work, assuming I had made the mistake (but have verified using mathematica, graphing calculators etc.) For someone working nearly every problem, this leads to a lot of confusion and a huge waste of time. I estimate that I have found 20-30 major errors already, and I've only finished the chapters covering calculus of a single variable. :(<br />If they had errata published, it might be a little better, but haven't been able to find any.<br />Unfortunately, haven't tried other review texts...probably better just to get a real calculus book. I've forgotten the one I used in high school and subsequently sold. :(	2004-06-05

Having said that, _The Zenith Angle_ is a bit of a disappointment. Bruce Sterling can be uneven like this. I  absolutely loved _Schismatrix_ and _Holy Fire_; I adore his short stories, particularly _The Bicycle Mechanic_, and the _Globalhead_ ones; _Distraction_ left me in awe and with a vague feeling that I'm missing something not running for office, but the hero being such a wunderkid strained my credibility. On the other hand, _The Difference Engine_ bored me with its improbabilities and made a &quot;style over substance&quot; impression.<br />Zenith Angle suffers from breaking what I consider the seminal rule of good literature -- that it should not be about exceptional superheroes, but about normal people in exceptional conditions. I find it hard to care for a supergeek who by his technical superpowers comes out of most any hurdle. Similarly, all other characters are painted with a rather broad and very bold stroke. It makes for fast-paced action and some great puns, the book is hard to put down, I must say. But afterward comes the reflection -- what was all that about, really?<br />The ending is plain bad. In just one chapter all assumptions are turned over, and out of the blue our hero turns into a regular James Bond whereas good guys become villains. It's worse than comic-book-like; I actually caught myself wondering if this is not some sort of elaborate joke on the part of Bruce.<br />The author's political convictions shine not too subtly throughout the book's pages. Their relevance will be verified in the coming years; but I am afraid that because the book is so engaged in the current discourse, it will age fast, and be forgotten quickly. There are nice touches of Bruce's insight into the human condition in the ever-transforming world that give the book a redeeming value, though.	2004-06-04

This review is as unbiased as I can make it, though I must admit to some bias in favor of the military forces in the UK, the USA and elsewhere, generally a poorly-paid, thankless and risky job. At the same time, I realize there were some major mistakes in World War II, as in all human endeavors. My original review was over twice this long, but the limit here is 1,000 words.<br />When well into Chapter 4 and the beginning of Chapter 5, I was having serious trouble with what I was reading. My problems were often not with what the text stated, but with what was NOT stated. Near the top of page 133 is a &quot;debunk&quot; of the idea of the Blitzkrieg. It fails to describe the effectiveness of the strategy, e.g., the German attack into Poland and Belgium and France.<br />Page 139 has, &quot;Superficially, the Soviet Union seemed to be exactly the sort of weak state that Germany had defeated so easily in the previous eighteen months.&quot; &quot;Superficially&quot;?? &quot;Exactly&quot;?? My marginal note says, &quot;The Sov. Un. was MUCH larger. Much different than a small eastern European country that could be occupied and this way defeated.&quot; Doesn't make sense to me. This would be like comparing a bowling ball to a ping-pong ball.<br />By the end of Chapter 5, I had become considerably more uncertain of the credibility of the book, particularly with its lack of references. The first page of Chapter 6 has, &quot;The Second World War did not witness a period of unprecedented technological advance and there is little evidence that the overall pace of change increased.&quot; The next paragraph states, &quot;To some extent the most revolutionary changes in warfare took place during the 1930s. Most of the Second World War was fought by equipment either in service or designed in the 1930s.&quot;<br />These statements make no sense to me. The author seemsto presume that new technology would be available almost immediately after its need was perceived, and this is simply not realistic. As a professor of politics, the author cannot be expected to be a technical expert, but such a statement should have been reviewed and corrected prior to publication. (For example, the Garand rifle took ten years to design, and it's trivial compared to a new fighter, a bomber or tank.) Further, the author is British, and for Britain, the war indeed started in the 1930s - September, 1939. How could they have used equipment that was designed later? Also, it fails to address equipment like the proximity fuse, and the huge advantages of short wavelength radar that allowed it to be used in aircraft, which had a major effect on the Battle of the Atlantic. Or the &quot;Schnorkel&quot; developed by the Germans. These are just three examples of many, and their design, development and placement into service occurred very rapidly compared to peacetime.<br />Chapter 7, &quot;Combat&quot;, beginning on p.187, finished it for me. Frequently in the book, the author makes an assertion, then supports it with what appears to be carefully selected but non-representative examples. Here are some:<br />p.187: &quot;First, the overwhelming majority of men conscripted never saw combat.&quot; This is both normal, and well known. Numbers vary, but 10 to 20 support troops are required for each soldier actually in combat. This is not &quot;news&quot;, and I don't see the point of the statement.<br />p.188: &quot;Although in retrospect the tank is seen as the dominant element in land warfare, in practice its contribution was very limited.&quot; I wonder if any of the Brits, Australians or New Zealanders who fought Rommel would agree. Or the Poles, Belgians and French who tried to stop the German attacks? Or those Germans who fought Patton? <br />p.191, with respect to combat casualties: &quot;This was particularly so for the infantry, which suffered the highest proportion of casualties.&quot; My marginal notes: &quot;Imagine that! And here I thought it would be artillerymen, or maybe mess cooks way behind the lines. . .&quot;<br />Conclusions:<BR>1.   I do not know the intended audience for this book, but I am not among them. Although I am not - and make no claim to be - a historian, military or otherwise, I have read over 100 books on WW2, and hence have found it quite easy to &quot;punch holes&quot; in many of the book's assertions.<br />2.   I bought this book at a yard sale for 50 cents. By the time I had reached page 260, I was happy that I had paid no more than that. It would be a huge mistake to use this book to form general conclusions about World War II. It does contain some valuable information, but there are no references by which it can be verified, and there are far too many assertions that are either unsupported or rely on non-typical examples. There is no way to separate the valuable from the non-valuable without extensive additional reading.<br />3.   I would very much like to see an extensive re-write where the &quot;chaff&quot; is removed from the &quot;wheat&quot; for the reader. I believe the factual, significant information found here is quite valuable, and would have great potential in acquiring an objective perspective of World War II when combined with further reading. But my guess is that a re-write would just about cut it in half.<br />In summary, I believe this book fails to achieve the claim of its title, and also fails to provide either a reasonable perspective or a reasonable understanding of World War II.<br />Bill Muckerheide<BR>New Mexico, USA<BR>wamco1nm &quot;at&quot; abq.com	2004-06-02

The fact that any Americans believe this trash is mind-boggling.  The hate that spews from this self-loathing man is gross and pathetic.  He is everything America should never, and will NEVER be.  If you disagree with Savage he stamps the label of \\"liberal\\" on you. This is also a label that he throws around to damn freely. He has it in his warped mind that every gay man, female, Mexican, Muslim, African American, Asian and so on would even classify themselves as a \\"liberal\\". Basically he uses this label and stamps it on people that simply have different beliefs than him. You can't blame everything that's wrong in a society on one group! This is what Hitler did for crying out loud!!!!<br />You can't go 3 sentences in this book without Savage calling someone unpatriotic or a communist or a liberal whom he sees as interchangeable. Every line he calls another person a name without every backing it up. The book is filled with religious rhetoric and anyone who believes this crap is just plain ignorant. Apparently, like Bush, Savage wants to stomp on the Constitution and let religion into our public places, especially schools. He opposed the removal of a granite monument to The 10 Commandments. JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE IN AMERICA OPPOSE YOUR VIEWS OR THE VIEWS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T MAKE THEIR VIEWS WRONG, OR THE PEOPLE UNPATRIOTIC. <br />The book is horribly written, with little factual information. He just rambles on for sentence after sentence in an unorganized way. If there was any point or message to his writing I couldn't get it through all the homophobia and red scare talk. Apparently Savage thinks we're still in the height of the Cold War the way he claims anyone who is unreligious or opposed to the war in Iraq is a Communist, even though Bush and his whole administration are now proven liars. I can't believe how many reviews support this book; I can't in my right mind see how anyone could see this as a good book or any of his points valid. I for one, am a proud American, and it is people like Savage who perpetuate the idea that America should be for the few not for everyone. If you other reviews want to call me a Communist or whatever for writing this, then go right ahead, it will just show how ignorant and uninformed you are, as well as Savage. <br />He says he supports the military but not one word was written about the cuts in soldier's pay and benefits, cuts in combat pay and overseas cost of living, etc., etc. Nor did he mention anything about Bush's massive cuts in the Veterans Administration health care system for disabled American Patriotic soldiers. Of course he probably got a draft deferment or went hiding into the guard to avoid the Vietnam War, just like the conservatives he blindly supports. Even if you believe this nut-case, the book is poorly written and overly-simplistic.<br />For fun, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of :The Da Vinci Code' and Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.'

Hannity is a rude bigoted ultra-conservative idiot. Yet, he has a rabid following of bubbas and country club neo-cons. A FOX robot that has never questioned Bush, ever. Yet, even now, more and more Republican politicians and conservatives are questioning the lying corporate gang we have in the White House. If you want one-sided drivel that pumps up your fantasy of the neo-con chicken hawks and Dubya, then waste your money on this junk.<br />Fast forward now to GWB: Technology has moved ahead, and where under Ronnie there were brief film clips, today the images are measured in tenths of a second ­ splintered partial pictures and powerful symbols that are all run together in profusion. Words themselves no longer matter much so now it's only images that count. Body language can be a narrative all its own. Here's Bush junior a blank-slate in reality, pretending to be the president, and he slouches, he swaggers, he's tough and crude and mean, whenever he speaks of \\"the evil ones,\\" as though he were about to join in the fight. But the facts tell a very different story. He's nothing but a frat boy, a power junkie in the bleachers of life, a failure and a fool. Does that matter? No! Why not, because people vote for him based on the character they have made him into in their minds, regardless of the myriad lies and deceit. His legacy..... <br />I've created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. <br />I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history. <br />I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. <br />I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. <br />I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. \\"prisoners of war\\" detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.<br />He has set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. As a President who doesn't fair well under public scrutiny, he set the record for fewest numbers of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. But he did manage to set the record for most campaign fundraising trips by a U.S. President and become the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations. After taking off the entire month of August, George W. presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history. His largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of his best friends, Kenneth Lay, hasn't answered for the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. History. His political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure his success with the U.S. Supreme Court during the election decision. He has protected friends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history which have been supported by Bush Jr.<br />Some page turners and memorable reads I recommend:  I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over.

Confusion courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down with too much historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory. <br />Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics as the story continues.<br />I'm always sad to finish long novels, because life seems so mundane afterward.

But the book is not literature by any means or definition. When people are too ignorant to read history and theology, you concoct a fable written to the sixth grade reading level based on two men's interpretation of the Bible. It's kind of like `Religion For Dummies', or `Compassion - For Members Only.'  Holy Blood - Holy Grail is a superior read.<br />The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the five star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:<BR>In `Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew `and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is `not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, `and then' His dead body was hung on a `tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text. <BR>The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <BR>The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In `I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made `a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahabmade an `idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was `idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />The authors claim this is not speculative fiction, but what will happen, more or less, when the rest of us are `Left Behind.' Good riddance, I say. And take all the fundamentalist Muslim fanatics, who are of the same blind ilk, with you.  This is a must read for skeptics of truth and devout fundamentalist zealot Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" It features a 15 year-old crack whore performing fellatio and depicts more murders than does Ludacris' hit album \\"Word of Mouf\\". <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give tax breaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<br />This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s. Conservatives wake up; you are paying for corporate welfare.

Tom Clancy who has many admirers in the military criticizes Bush and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Clancy says he almost &quot;came to blows&quot; with a leading war supporter, former Pentagon adviser and neo-con Richard Perle.  The master of such million-selling thrillers as &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; is adding to the criticism of the Iraq war, and not only through his own comments. <br />&quot;Battle Ready,&quot; is a collaboration with another war critic, retired Marine Gen. Anthony C. Zinni. &quot;Battle Ready&quot; looks at Zinni's long military career, dating back to the Vietnam War, and includes harsh remarks by Zinni about the current conflict and the President. Zinni has openly attacked the war and Clancy acknowledges his own concerns.  <br />But even as an envoy, Zinni spoke out against invading Iraq, regarding it as disastrous for Middle East peace and a distraction from the war against terrorism. Zinni says getting rid of Saddam Hussein was not worth the price of our brave soldiers and the enormous tax burden for generations to come.<br />&quot;He's a bad guy. He's a terrible guy and he should go,&quot; Zinni said. &quot;But I don't think it's worth 800 troops dead, 4,500 wounded - some of them terribly - $300 billion of our treasury and counting, and our reputation and our image in the world, particularly in that region, shattered.&quot; Clancy states that, `Some of the people the President listens to bother me greatly. How many times does someone have to be wrong before the President wises up?\\" <br />Neither Zinni or Clancy would commit to vote for Bush in the coming election. Zinni, a registered Republican who voted for Bush in 2000, said he could not support the president's re-election. I'm a Republican, but I will vote for Nader or Kerry before I vote for Bush again.  <br />Some page turners and memorable reads I recommend:  I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away.

The only FREE PRESS we have left is the individual author and researcher like Woodward, who makes us think and evaluate our biased corporate-media feed and mal-nurtured minds. As a life long moderate Republican, I cannot let my ideology and prejudices obscure the fact that our President is the most ignorant, deceitful, flippant, embarrassing, and shameful President during my lifetime. I'm 60+ and have voted Republican since Eisenhower. Infringement of our Constitution and Bill of Rights all under the guise of National Security does not bode well for the US and our children's future. <br />The author clearly knows his facts and can prove them. He outlines and reveals the massive lies, propaganda, and deceit of Bush and the neo-cons leading up to the Iraq war. An un-called for war, and a war that put U.S. Soldiers in harms way, needlessly. All the while the Bush administration was cutting military pay, combat pay, and Veterans benefits. Not to mention the billions he cut from the Veteran's Administration budget, denying aid to newly disabled veterans. Shame on them, but mostly shame on our President.<br />The frantic, blind, and zealous followers of King Bush, (King because he was appointed by the Supreme Court and not elected), <BR>Rant and Rave that this is yet another lying assault on their hero.<BR>If this is a book of lies, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Perhaps because, our \\"Republicant and donut read wells.\\" (Sorry, my attempt at humor)<br />Seems like the standards of Presidential excellence; the ability to orate and write brilliantly, the deep understanding of history, politics, and the Constitution/Bill of Rights, have died. Shamefully this President has the lowest IQ of ANY President in the history of our country. Several independent studies have evaluated his IQ or lack thereof. It appears a President can start an illegal war, invade a foreign country based on outright lies and deceit, and be a hero to about 50% of Americans. What does that say about that particular segment of our citizens? People who refuse to find and seek the truth and act on it; people who value bluster, bragging, showing off, insincerity, lying, passing the buck, and puffery over intellect, truthfulness, and fairness. Read Woodward, and astute, intelligent, logical author with actual facts. <br />Woodward, Clarke, Dean, and the list goes on; are heroes, even if I don't always agree with them, they all have one thing in common. They give us different points of views, decent, alternative arguments, which make ourselves objective and aware. Soldiers, firemen, and policemen are heroes because the risk their lives for us every day, usually unappreciated and underpaid. Why has my president dishonored my fellow American Veterans by not having time to attend NOT ONE funeral of a soldier from a war he started. Yet he's taken more vacations and spent more time at home than ANY President in history. You cannot discount Woodward, he is a savvy Washington reporter and insider who can back up his FACTS, FACTS, and more FACTS! <br />On other conspiracies: if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

For a couple of years I have been narrowing down my &quot;food wisdom&quot; to two words, &quot;Pure Food&quot;. She verified my thinking.

A strange but ultimately informative book on the development of synthetic sex steroids hormones, alongside research into cervical cancer and terrible experimentation on human beings, in National Socialist (Nazi) concentration camps. <br />The concentration camps took the competitive commercial considerations of privately owned companies and stockholders with aid from the state to chilling extremes. I do not agree with some of the book's conclusions and its blending of fact and fiction can be off-putting for those trying to discover facts.<br />All the more disconcerting to find at the end of the book that only minor details are fiction and most of the important stuff is true and can be verified. It is interesting to me that the research into cervical cancer and the horrific experiments to test the effect of cold conditions on humans to develop clothing and resuscitation techniques for German pilots ran side by side with research with steroid sex hormones. <br />The following is my line of thought. Regarding cervical cancer, even penicillin was developed as a miracle cure for VD in wartime and links between cervical cancer and synthetic sex steroid hormones have been published at least since the 1980s. Research into cervical cancer and synthetic sex steroids went side by side in the camps. <br />Regarding the effects of extreme cold, synthetic sex steroids can have many effects on the vasular system, including causing blue blood and extreme cold in the hands and feet. <br />Worth reading this book with Dr Ellen Grant's \\"The Bitter Pill. How Safe is the Perfect Contraceptive?\\" and \\"Sexual Chemistry. Understanding our Hormones, the Pill and HRT\\", along with Barbara Seaman's \\"The Doctor's Case Against The Pill\\".<br />Dr Victor Wynn is quoted in the Seaman book as saying \\"I see impairment in women on the pill ... The machinery of metabolism is beautifully complex and harmonious. It is easy enough to dominate it by introducing substances like the synthetic hormones in thePill, but we have no idea of what risks we run by assuming control of such a delicate process. After all, there is no cell in the body that is not affected by oral contraceptives -- nerve cells, skin cells, liver cells, blood cells. <br />Yet the same doctor was one of the letter writers to the British Medical Journal saying, after girls and women were warned by the UK's Committee on Safety of Medicine about possible adverse effects of the third generation Pill, \\"Unfortunately, the precipitate action of the Committee on Safety of Medicines may have seriously damaged our chances of learning just what effect the new pills have on arterial disease. More importantly still, it may also have irrevocably undermined any further research and development on oral contraceptives by the pharmaceutical industry.\\"<br />When set against The Clauberg Conspiracies, what does this spell out about research and the passing of drugs as fit for prescription? What price research?	2004-05-17

The novel, Go Ask Alice, brings you through the life of a troubled teen and her screwed up social life as she struggles to overcome her drug problem. The one thing that keeps her alive is the thing she treasures most in the world, and that would be her diary. This is the journal that the entire world now has access to. She takes it everywhere with her including her school, a mental institution, California, and a variety of other places. The style used by her in which she talks about her troubles and woes helps you to better understand her, almost as if you knew her, and were a close confidant of hers. <BR>        Many see this book as a way to encourage drug use. But I feel it can be used to teach the consequences of your actions. Many lessons can also be learned from this novel, such as; trust but verify. She was first introduced to drugs when she went to a friend's party in which cocaine was present. If only she would have \\"verified\\" before attending, her problem would have never occurred, and the course of this novel would have been entirely altered. One of the greatest things about this novel was your attachment to the main character. You felt for this girl as she tried and tried to overcome her addiction. You wanted her to finally break free from the things that kept her back such as speed, cocaine, and other harmful drugs that eventually led her to her death. <BR> I would definitely recommend this book to others, yet only to a certain audience. People of twelve and younger, might have trouble comprehending this novel. It makes many references to things people learn about much later in life. Those who plan on reading Go Ask Alice will certainly get something back from this book. No longer do you look at drugs and those addicted to them the same way.	2004-05-17

The hate that spews from this self-loathing man is gross and pathetic.  He is everything America should never, and will NEVER be.  If you disagree with Savage he stamps the label of \\"liberal\\" on you. This is also a label that he throws around to damn freely. He has it in his warped mind that every gay man, female, Mexican, Muslim, African American, Asian and so on would even classify themselves as a \\"liberal\\". Basically he uses this label and stamps it on people that simply have different beliefs than him. You can't blame everything that's wrong in a society on one group! This is what Hitler did for crying out loud!!!!<br />You can't go 3 sentences in this book without Savage calling someone unpatriotic or a communist or a liberal whom he sees as interchangeable. Every line he calls another person a name without every backing it up. The book is filled with religious rhetoric and anyone who believes this crap is just plain ignorant. Apparently, like Bush, Savage wants to stomp on the Constitution and let religion into our public places, especially schools. He opposed the removal of a granite monument to The 10 Commandments. JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE IN AMERICA OPPOSE YOUR VIEWS OR THE VIEWS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T MAKE THEIR VIEWS WRONG, OR THE PEOPLE UNPATRIOTIC. <br />The book is horribly written, with little factual information. He just rambles on for sentence after sentence in an unorganized way. If there was any point or message to his writing I couldn't get it through all the homophobia and red scare talk. Apparently Savage thinks we're still in the height of the Cold War the way he claims anyone who is unreligious or opposed to the war in Iraq is a Communist, even though Bush and his whole administration are now proven liars. I can't believe how many reviews support this book; I can't in my right mind see how anyone could see this as a good book or any of his points valid. I for one, am a proud American, and it is people like Savage who perpetuate the idea that America should be for the few not for everyone. If you other reviews want to call me a Communist or whatever for writing this, then go right ahead, it will just show how ignorant and uninformed you are, as well as Savage. <br />He says he supports the military but not one word was written about the cuts in soldier's pay and benefits, cuts in combat pay and overseas cost of living, etc., etc. Nor did he mention anything about Bush's massive cuts in the Veterans Administration health care system for disabled American Patriotic soldiers. Of course he probably got a draft deferment or went hiding into the guard to avoid the Vietnam War, just like the conservatives he blindly supports. Even if you believe this nut-case, the book is poorly written and overly-simplistic.<br />For fun, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of :The Da Vinci Code' and Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.'

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" (...)<br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give taxbreaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<br />This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s. Conservatives wake up; you are paying for corporate welfare. Al Frankin's thoughts are right on. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

This appears to be the author's first stab at historical biography, and as such is a bit of a disappointment. It reads well, but one is constantly aware of it's bias. It tends to judge the past based on the present as the author sees it; monday morning quarterbacking as it were. The author's version of the Civil War has the radical Republicans able to do no wrong.<BR>What he misses is the fact that both sides committed atrocities.<BR>This is history at its most politically correct. Sort of like an account of the war in Iraq as written by someone in the West Wing of the White House. The book presents some incidents as &quot;fact&quot; that actually can't be verified, despite the extensive notes. He has Jesse entering the bank at Northfield when it has never been fully established which of the bandits entered. The idea of Jesse James is a Confederate &quot;terrorist&quot; is flawed. One is expected to see political manifestos handed out AT robberies, if this be the case. At best, Jesse seems to have been after the money and hiding behind the editorial writings of John N. Edwards, who DID have a political agenda to restore a two party system in Missouri after the war. In reading this book one has the feeling that imposition of the &quot;old order&quot; was the only thing the Democrats were after following the war. It was more complex than that. Prior to this revisionist account, it was generally assumed that Edwards was behind the letters that appeared in his newspaper. There are no Lawrence-style massacres in connection with robberies, on several occasions the outlaws even told people they just wanted the money, but this fails to be mentioned. I expect we'll have a book that claims that Bonnie and Clyde were politically motivated &quot;terrorists&quot; next. I presume the &quot;terror&quot; hook was intended to sell books. This book is going for bargain basement prices for good reason.	2004-05-14

The only FREE PRESS we have left is the individual author and researcher like Woodward, who makes us think and evaluate our biased corporate-media feed and mal-nurtured minds. As a life long moderate Republican, I cannot let my ideology and prejudices obscure the fact that our President is the most ignorant, deceitful, flippant, embarrassing, and shameful President during my lifetime. I'm 60+ and have voted Republican since Eisenhower. Infringement of our Constitution and Bill of Rights all under the guise of National Security does not bode well for the US and our children's future. <br />The author clearly knows his facts and can prove them. He outlines and reveals the massive lies, propaganda, and deceit of Bush and the neo-cons leading up to the Iraq war. An un-called for war, and a war that put U.S. Soldiers in harms way, needlessly. All the while the Bush administration was cutting military pay, combat pay, and Veterans benefits. Not to mention the billions he cut from the Veteran's Administration budget, denying aid to newly disabled veterans. Shame on them, but mostly shame on our President.<br />The frantic, blind, and zealous followers of King Bush, (King because he was appointed by the Supreme Court and not elected), <BR>Rant and Rave that this is yet another lying assault on their hero.<BR>If this is a book of lies, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Perhaps because, our \\"Republicant and donut read wells.\\" (Sorry, my attempt at humor)<br />Seems like the standards of Presidential excellence; the ability to orate and write brilliantly, the deep understanding of history, politics, and the Constitution/Bill of Rights, have died. Shamefully this President has the lowest IQ of ANY President in the history of our country. Several independent studies have evaluated his IQ or lack thereof. It appears a President can start an illegal war, invade a foreign country based on outright lies and deceit, and be a hero to about 50% of Americans. What does that say about that particular segment of our citizens? People who refuse to find and seek the truth and act on it; people who value bluster, bragging, showing off, insincerity, lying, passing the buck, and puffery over intellect, truthfulness, and fairness. Read Woodward, and astute, intelligent, logical author with actual facts. <br />Woodward, Clarke, Dean, and the list goes on; are heroes, even if I don't always agree with them, they all have one thing in common. They give us different points of views, decent, alternative arguments, which make ourselves objective and aware. Soldiers, firemen, and policemen are heroes because the risk their lives for us every day, usually unappreciated and underpaid. Why has my president dishonored my fellow American Veterans by not having time to attend NOT ONE funeral of a soldier from a war he started. Yet he's taken more vacations and spent more time at home than ANY President in history. You cannot discount Woodward, he is a savvy Washington reporter and insider who can back up his FACTS, FACTS, and more FACTS! <br />On other conspiracies: if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

I do not think that Ngubu or the reader from London,Uk read the book very careful or have much knowledge about card counting themselves.. the author did a fine job and did alot of research about the topic.. he didnt just interview Kevin Lewis and took his word about it.. he verified all info via independent sources... first of all just because your a expert card counter does not mean you will win 100% of the time.. the popular misconception is that if your a card counter you know what every card that is coming out is (though its theoritically possbile through shuffle tracking but its not 100% accurate).. card counting just gives you a probable guess as to high cards to low cards left in the deck.. it will not tell you for absolute fact the next card is a ace of spades (or whatever card).. when the deck is rich in high cards it is in the players favor (high cards bust dealers hands and gives you the chance for a blackjack and to double down bets) when it is rich in low cards it its in the Houses's favor (less likely to bust and more probable to beat your hand)...when you know the &quot;count&quot; you vary your bet accordingly.. bet more when rich in high cards and bet less when rich in low cards..  as for Ngubu saying why didnt they just go to casino's around the world.. if you were more informed of blackjack history since the 70's lets say. u would know that the casino's hire a Private Investigation firm that helps them keep tabs on card counters.. no matter how a expert card counter you are sooner or later they will put 2 and 2 together and see a common thread/link.. similar faces in disguises, same people at the same casino's at the same time but do not acknowledge each other etc... but anyways this PI firm keeps a book that is called The Griffin Book that has photos and information on card counters and cheats.. and that book is sent worldwide to casino's.. so that answers your question.. in fact one MIT BJ team (there are several not just the one in the book) was caught in Monte Carlo and escorted out of Monte Carlo by the police but were allowed to keep there winnings... as for the reader in UK.. he/she is obviously no mathmatician (yet makes judgements about such) and is definelty not a card counter because UK doesnt understand card counting to begin with just thinks if your a expert you will never get caught.. as for blackjack teams being done in the 70's .. yes you are right it was .. by a legend actually.. Ken Uston (he perfected the Big Player role &amp; he also sued Atlantic City casinos and won which now u can count cards in AC without getting banned but they will make it difficult for you to do so by changing the rules to blackjack or only letting you bet the minimum while everyone else at the table can bet whatever they want etc.).. but he was banned from every casino there was eventually cause his face got recognized and he was one hell of a expert and there is no refuting he wasnt.. What the MIT team did was keep records of there playing sessions, fed it into a computer and came out with solutions to any playing problems at the table through mathmatics etc..  as for blackjack in general you have no knowledge of it except probably basic rules of the game.. if you studied it you would know that in the short run anything can happen if your a card counter (major losing streaks included) but in the long run if your a expert card counter and do it perfectly you will come out ahead... Anyways i recommend this book to anyone who is aspiring to be a card counter as well as people who like to hear that david vs goliath true stories still exist... It is suppose to be made into a movie being produced by Kevin Spacey.. though im not sure what title the movie will be because &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; was recently made a movie starring Steve Martin and Queen Latifah that had nothing to do with blackjack... anyways read it you'll love it period..s caught in Monte Carlo and escorted out of Monte Carlo by the police but were allowed to keep there winnings... as for the reader in UK.. he/she is obviously no mathmatician (yet makes judgements about such) and is definelty not a card counter because UK doesnt understand card counting to begin with just thinks if your a expert you will never get caught.. as for blackjack teams being done in the 70's .. yes you are right it was .. by a legend actually..

In the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez oil spill Holleman casts a critical eye on restoration money designated for scientific study. \\"All this counting, tagging, radio-implanting, all these projects, research, buildings--I could not fathom how they would help restore the wild,\\" she writes.<br />Finally, the book takes on a larger scope, asking that we take a hard look at our adaptability to environmental degradation. Things that bother her should trouble us all: noise pollution, species' extinction, global warming, acid rain. How is it that we have come to accept these phenomena as \\"natural\\" by-products of economic growth? Thanks to Holleman and other nature writers these issues will continue to surface in discussions across the nation. And, if we are lucky, those in power will begin to listen.	2004-05-10

Essence goes hand in hand with existence and the existence of essences can not be denied without contradiction. Regarding consciousness, this reviewer begs the question by assuming consciousness is not a purely natural, material phenomenon. All one can do is simply see that it exists and accept it; they can not attach any theistic presuppositions to it. Regarding justice and evil, this reviwer assumes God decides what is just and moral but this leads back to the divine command/divine privilge approach to ethics I talked about earlier and showed to be problematic. There is no need to repeat myself here. <br />&quot;In short...as well.&quot; <BR>Obvious Christian presuppositionalist rhetoric. First of all, Smith is not depending on Christianity for anything. He simply starts with logical axioms and proceeds with his epistemic and metaphysical investigations from there. By claiming that Smith can not make knowledge claims without allegedly depending on Christianity for logical laws, the reviewer could be criticized for begging the question about the origin of logical laws. In fact, I am not even sure they had an origin. A theist may say they did with God, but by saying this, he implicitly affirms the truth of the law of identity even when there was only God and I have explained this further in my review elsewhere. <br />This Christian presuppositionalist labeled Smith a dogmatist yet he was a dogmatist himself. I would be tempted to call that hypocrisy but that would imply Smith actually is a dogmatist in the way the reviewer accused him of, but as is evident, these accuations totally fail. One final point is that throughout his reviw, this reviwer uses the word omniscience as meaning to know everything. Smith shows in his book that this characteristic of having unverified, automatic knowledge is unintelligible and plunges us into agnosticism.  Anyway, the omnimax God has been shown by philosophersto be incoherent. Something that is incoherent has no place in a discourse where intelligible things are being spoken of.	2004-05-08

I was hoping for something more researched, like a compilation of several articles I have occasionally read in &quot;Scientific American&quot; and &quot;Discover.&quot;  Not only was this book merely opininated ramblings, the prose didn't make for easy reading.  (For example, over half of his sentences begin with the letter &quot;I.&quot;  It gets dreary after a while.)  <br />All in all, this book reads like a ten page research paper stretched out to book length with a lot of non-pertinent information and pointless conjecture tossed in.  The photographs are interesting, although many of them (the polish woman with the arrows describing directions for putting on make-up, for example) provide just enough information to intrigue me, and then leave me with unanswered questions.  <BR>Considering how long this book is, I would have hoped he would have touched on refraction, color blindness, the sighted blind, optical illusions, etc.  Instead, he mostly describes non-art objects the way an art critic would.  He has a few interesting points, e.g. his brain has been permananty trained to recognize moth-like shapes because of a fondness for the insects in childhood, but even this interesting fact is couched in long, rambling prose.<BR>If you've never ever read anything about vision, and don't mind that most of his conjectures aren't verified, you might find this interesting.  If you, like me, were hoping for a layman's explaination of a fascinating subject, you will be sorely disappointed.	2004-05-07

If you are a person, that has always asked &quot;too many questions,&quot; this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your fiction collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right? <br />As a voracious reader, I have read the best. &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; is a heart-stopping thriller that keeps you turning pages until you arrive exhausted at the end. You're truly &quot;in on the chase.&quot; Improbable as it seems, Dan Brown has combined nuclear physics and antimatter with Renaissance art, old Rome and the Vatican. You conjure up the images in your mind, but the icing on the cake is Brown's Web site, which shows you the CERN facilities, the plane and then the exquisite artwork of Bernini and others as well as a peek inside the Vatican. It's a book that teaches, makes you think, and entertains, all at the same time. Few authors can accomplish that. <br />For those who say this book goes against their beliefs and their dogma, consider this: The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. Read `Holy Blood, Holy Grail,' and ANYTHING by Ken Follett!

With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.<br />The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.<br />The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms.<br />It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.<br />Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.<br />Here's how 1984 applies to current events:<br />WAR IS PEACE<br />The new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;<br />FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br />&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.<br />IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH<br />America's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.<br />When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell is `HERE AND NOW.\\"<br />If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also:  I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away.

The only FREE PRESS we have left is the individual author and researcher like Woodward, who makes us think and evaluate our biased corporate-media feed and mal-nurtured minds. As a life long moderate Republican, I cannot let my ideology and prejudices obscure the fact that our President is the most ignorant, deceitful, flippant, embarrassing, and shameful President during my lifetime. I'm 60+ and have voted Republican since Eisenhower. Infringement of our Constitution and Bill of Rights all under the guise of National Security does not bode well for the US and our children's future. <br />The author clearly knows his facts and can prove them. He outlines and reveals the massive lies, propaganda, and deceit of Bush and the neo-cons leading up to the Iraq war. An un-called for war, and a war that put U.S. Soldiers in harms way, needlessly. All the while the Bush administration was cutting military pay, combat pay, and Veterans benefits. Not to mention the billions he cut from the Veteran's Administration budget, denying aid to newly disabled veterans. Shame on them, but mostly shame on our President.<br />The frantic, blind, and zealous followers of King Bush, (King because he was appointed by the Supreme Court and not elected), <BR>Rant and Rave that this is yet another lying assault on their hero.<br />If this is a book of lies, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Perhaps because, our \\"Republicant and donut read wells.\\" (Sorry, my attempt at humor)<br />Seems like the standards of Presidential excellence; the ability to orate and write brilliantly, the deep understanding of history, politics, and the Constitution/Bill of Rights, have died. Shamefully this President has the lowest IQ of ANY President in the history of our country. Several independent studies have evaluated his IQ or lack thereof. It appears a President can start an illegal war, invade a foreign country based on outright lies and deceit, and be a hero to about 50% ofAmericans. What does that say about that particular segment of our citizens? People who refuse to find and seek the truth and act on it; people who value bluster, bragging, showing off, insincerity, lying, passing the buck, and puffery over intellect, truthfulness, and fairness. Read Woodward, and astute, intelligent, logical author with actual facts. <br />Woodward, Clarke, Dean, and the list goes on; are heroes, even if I don't always agree with them, they all have one thing in common. They give us different points of views, decent, alternative arguments, which make ourselves objective and aware. Soldiers, firemen, and policemen are heroes because the risk their lives for us every day, usually unappreciated and underpaid. Why has my president dishonored my fellow American Veterans by not having time to attend NOT ONE funeral of a soldier from a war he started. Yet he's taken more vacations and spent more time at home than ANY President in history. You cannot discount Woodward, he is a savvy Washington reporter and insider who can back up his FACTS, FACTS, and more FACTS! <br />On other conspiracies: if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

The plot weaves like an intricate children's bedside story. But the book is not literature by any means or definition. When people are too ignorant to read history and theology, you concoct a fable written to the sixth grade reading level based on two men's interpretation of the Bible. It's kind of like `Religion For Dummies', or `Compassion - For Members Only.'  Holy Blood - Holy Grail is a superior read.<br />The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the five star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:<br />In `Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew `and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is `not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, `and then' His dead body was hung on a `tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text. <br />The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <br />The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In `I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made `a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an `idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was `idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />The authors claim this is not speculative fiction, but what will happen, more or less, when the rest of us are `Left Behind.' Good riddance, I say. And take all the fundamentalist Muslim fanatics, who are of the same blind ilk, with you.  This is a must read for skeptics of truth and devout fundamentalist zealot Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

Rigorous, elegant and simple. A quality book for pure and applied mathematics.<br />However I found two little mistakes:<br />In page 151, in the proof of the integral of a transformation, he makes use of the Dominated Convergence Theorem two times (one first time, at the begining of page 151, is right). Thats wrong because we can't &quot;dominate&quot; the function &quot;g&quot; when K -&gt; inf. The correct proof involves divide the function in positive and negative parts and then aplicate Monotone Convergence Theorem. The same in the end of the proof when he generalizes to infinite measure sets.<br />In page 157, equation (7) should be verified when ||h||&lt;2*delta, not ||h||&lt;delta as he writes. This is to assure that the set C+ is contained in that region.<br />Anyway, a brilliant text. Purchase it.	2004-05-05

Notice what word I capitalized.  Larson makes a lot of CLAIMS that cannot be independently proven. The stories of his cases of demon possession and exorcism sound a lot like fiction and not reality. I listened in to BL's talk show when he did the live exorcisms by phone routine and once I even called him criticizing why these alleged demons did not hang up the phone, In this book BL makes some lame claim that yes demons on his show HAVE hung up the phone. In my experience of listening in, I NEVER heard one of these alleged demon possessed callers hang up the phone. Funny tho how these demons also did not violate FCC rules.<br /><br /> He once again attacked some Wiccans in this book, and for all his claims of personal experience with supposedly supernatural forces, I find it interesting considering what Larson is in real life that these alleged demons have not spoken out about his sins. Funny also that there have been no atheists who have shown demons in them, or of people who were not brought up in the demons around us imagery. The section on  \\"wicca\\" ( lowercase) and \\" witchcraft\\" is pathetically dated and erroneous.<br /><br /> All I can say to any reader, believer in \\"spiritual warfare\\" or not is this: Question the source of these claims. It's too easy for believers to be conned by people like Larson and \\" Dr. Rebecca Brown\\". Check out their credibility. In both Brown and Larson cases  there are more than enough evidences to show that both people have lied.  I have serious doubts that ANY of these stories Larson said actually happened. They sound ficticious and made up.  Larson's own actions hardly make him a credible source.<br /><br /> As for this book, if you like \\"recycled\\" copy and pastes of other books into a so-called \\" new\\" book, then you'll be a good sucker for this one. And sucker is the right word. There are whole sections in this book that came straight out of previous books bearing Larson's name as \\"author\\", including the author's intro, which came right out of \\" In the Name of Satan\\". For the  publishing date of 1999, the information in the book is seriously outdated and inaccurate, but typical of Larson's hack work. For a guy who bills himself as the \\" foremost authority on cults and the occult\\" his research is sloppy, his stories of supposed demons, including claims he could have been murdered on the spot, read as self-glorifying bad fiction instead of descriptions of real events. Worse still, at one point in his \\"case\\" descriptions, he claims a teenager who supposedly sacrificed a human baby under pressure of a \\"satanic cult\\", he puts the onus of notifying authorities to the teenager( who BTW also claimed to have been initiated as \\" high priest\\" by the alleged cult) He and the pastor who supposedly \\" ministered\\" to the teen, if this story is true, committed a crime themselves by not notifying authorities.<br /><br />Bob Larson clearly took a lesson from the exposure of \\"Lauren Stratford's\\" ficticious story of being an SRA breeder, as in this book he claims he altered specifics of each case he discusses so that details such as dates, times and eyewitnesses cannot be verified independently. And that alone should raise questions as to what he claims are real cases may in fact be his many lies told for dramatic effect.<br /><br />This book has a lot of ironic passages to those who know what Larson really is. Things he claims \\" demons\\" do and \\"cults\\" do are also things he himself has done in the past decade or so. One of the amusing passages for me is the claims of the gender of the \\"demons\\". On his radio show he claimed that demons are all males and that any supposedly female spirit is basically a male in drag. In this book he claims demons are MOSTLY male, which leads to the question of why a non corporeal being such as a demon was made with a penis in the first place.<br /><br />For a guy who boasts that he is a \\" foremost authority\\", his actual content is woefully inadequate and shallow. Kinda like he is, actually.	2004-05-05

I have tried to figure them out for as long as I remember.  People like family members, friends and peers give different advice but none seems to be on point; they just tell you a little bit of the truth but they can't put everything together.  <BR>     <BR>Fortunately, during my quest for the truth about women I have encountered &quot;The System&quot;.  It is absolutely amazing how this book can tell you everything relevant there is to know about the nature of women.  <BR>     <BR>The book has answered all of the inconsistencies on women that I have thought about over the years:  <BR>(1) why are the hot women I am attracted to not interested in me; yet the ugly ones that I refuse are all over me. <BR>(2) why do these really hot women go to clubs yet they don't want to hook up with any guy.  <BR>(3) how do you easily identify women that are truly interested in you. <BR>(4) how to avoid being used by women. <BR>(5) how to stop wasting time with women.<BR>     <br />After reading &quot;The System&quot; I have a complete understanding of what I am to do when dealing with women; this book ended my frustration with them.  I have verified and applied the techniques in this book and they have worked many times; I have also experimented following my old routine with women; after applying my old techniques I have seen how they don't work at all and lead to utlimate failure; yet when I applied &quot;The System&quot; it has always given me rewarding results. <BR>    <BR>One of the most memorable things this book has taught me is how to be prepared for that one moment of truth.  It shows you how Michael Jordan doesn't waste his shots but just waits for that opportunity and takes full advantage of it; Jordan takes advantage b/c he knows what he is doing and teaching you what you are supposed to do through understanding how women interact is what this book prepares you for.    <BR>    <BR>Knowledge is power and I feel that this book has provided me with a lot of power in one of the most important aspects of any man's life.<br />I hope you find &quot;The System&quot; to be as insightful and useful to you as it has been for me.	2004-05-02
US	50941451	R2JS4SBQ26YBAC	0316168718	802115246	The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain	Books	4	66	81	N	N	Monument to ideals on a flimsy foundation	Writing history raises an inevitable challenge: relate events as they were or portray selected elements to emphasize a theme.  The former method is often ponderous, the latter often misleading.  Menocal has opted for the second option.  In her survey of Medieval Spain, she gives us an entertaining and informative look at expressions of the intellectual elite over seven centuries of Muslim rule.<br />Menocal's approach aims to restore Spanish Islam's blemished reputation.  Muslim Spain has endured a scathing censure imposed by &quot;victorious&quot; Christian Europe.  In the Christian view, the Reconquista of Spain freed a population from a Muslim yoke.  The European invasion of the Western Hemisphere carried that myth across the Atlantic while strengthening the crusading attitude of the conquistadores.  Menocal uses romantic poetry, the advancement of selected scholars to high posts under the caliphate, and the literacy of the Muslim and Jewish communities as evidence of high, positive interaction.  Even the Christians, normally disdainful of literacy, science and philosophy, joined the chorus of common interests.<br />Weaving her tale around the Cordovan Umayyad caliphs founded by exiled prince Abn al-Rahmad, she traces the building programs, internal disputes among the Islamic schisms arising along the Mediterranean, and the challenges posed by intruders from the north.  For Menocal, the binding force across Islamic Spain was language.  Arabic became a lingua franca with the power to transcend religious dogma and jurisdictional disputes.  Jews and Christians alike became fluent in this imposed language due to its expressive power.  Arabic was also used in the Eastern Mediterranean to recover and spread lost texts of the Greek scholars.  Thus, often unattributed, the Muslims kept medicine, astronomy, philosophy and other disciplines alive.  Christians would later adapt them joyfully, but the Dark Ages aren't misnamed for the rest of Western Europe.<br />Menocal might have produced a book of sweeping vision, restoring the image of Muslim Spain as one of civilisation's most noteworthy achievements.  Instead, she sinks into a swamp of romantic fervour, highlighting erotic poetry and grandiose architecture.  The farmers and small traders who were taxed to support these elitist endeavours likely had a different view.  That is, when they weren't in hiding from the nearly continuous wars waged among the Muslims or between the Islamic invaders from the south or the Christian ones from across the Pyrenees.<br />As she skips over the centuries, Menocal introduces the rising tide of Christian aggressive attitudes culminating in the Jewish/Muslim expulsion.  The French monastics at Cluny had adopted the liberal view of philosophy espoused by their Iberian neighbours.  Deeper in Europe, however, the Cistercians, ardent crusaders, urged expunging Christianity of any Arabic taint.  Viewpoints hardened, as Menocal recounts, through exchanges of essays and books.  Menocal doesn't investigate whether these expressions reached the general populace, but the Church hierarchy system ensured local parish priests acted as mouthpieces of the regional bishops.  The events of 1492 verified who had the louder voice.<br />Although tentatively concluding with the background of Columbus' departure, Menocal cannot resist extending her recital to the early 17th Century.  How can one write on Spain without folding the La Manchan epic into the story?  Finding Arabic roots in Cervantes is neither new nor difficult, but Menocal provides a new twist.  Menocal suggests Don Quixote's worldview is that of any thinker of the Muslim period.  Identity of any aspect of the world is muddled by a spread of conflicting, if not hostile, attitudes.  La Mancha thus becomes the last gasp of an integrated Spanish society that is considered insane by the rigid-minded world that succeeded it.<br />Given the span of time and involvement of numerous articulate historical figures, one turns  to the &quot;Other Readings&quot; at the back with high expectation.

If you are a person, that has always asked &quot;too many questions,&quot; this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one. The theories expressed in this book should be compiled in the mind along with the writings of Henry Lincoln (&quot;The Holy Place: The Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau....&quot; &amp; his more recent works), &quot;The Hiram Key,&quot; by Knight &amp; Lomas &amp; the other books of this genre. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right? <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.<br />The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <br />The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the one star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:<br />In `Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew `and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is `not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, `and then' His dead body was hung on a `tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text. <br />The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In `I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made `a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an `idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was `idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />As a student of history I applaud the fresh approach to history and literary criticism this book embodies. The nature of this work is admittedly controversial - but then it must be as `The Templar Revelation' breaks bold new ground. Research the genre and decide for yourself, but this book is a must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"<BR>Robert Rouche	2004-04-30

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	2	4	59	N	N	The Price of Loyalty	This book reads like an autobiography written by Paul O'Neil, I found myself trying to figure if it was O'Neil writing through Suskind or Suskind writing his own account of what O'Neil told him and verified it via O'Neil's documentation.  My commnet on this book either way is that O'Neil seems to a bit of an elite cry baby.  He seems insulted when Bush did not follow to the letter, his advice, but O'Neil in large part championed causes that were not his to champion, ie pushing the enviroment.  This seems a bit ridiculous for the Secretary of the Treasury.  He also seemed to be playing around and flying around under the radar in the administration.  For example he had numberous meetings with Christine Todd Whitman and others with Greenspan all of which were driven by O'Neil's adgenda, not the agenda of the Bush administraiton. His conduct seemed to be always and ever reaching over the head of Bush, not a good behaviour for one who wishes to keep his job.  If O'Neil really wanted his agenda to come to reality in regards to federal economic policy, then he should have kept his mouth shut on the enviroment, and pushed &quot;his good idea&quot; economic principles when he met with Bush, but rather he chose to cram the enviroment down Bush's throat time and again.  If you want your Social Security reform measures to be heard O'Neil, and I think his ideas on this were good, then push them, not the enviroment. If I were Bush observing O'Neil's behavior, I would likely ask him to step aside as well, as O'Neil's conduct seemed to try to undermine Bush, which is his exact intent in this book. O'Neil pretends to be a centerist in this acccount, yet his left wing enviromental ideas come out early in the book. O'Neil is a left winger, and I expect his to cast his vote for Kerry.  He is trying to convince other &quot;centerists&quot; to do the same.  O'Neil if you want your agenda heard as a liberal thinker in the conservative/dumb-dumb Bush administration, its probably better ifyou not run around like a rock star with Bono in Africa.  Grow up Paul. You were fired for good reason, you tried to undermine Bush behind the scenes from within the administration, that behavior got you canned.  Now grow up and admit to your faulty conduct as a participate in the administration.  You will find O'Neil is another liberal who fails to recognize Saddam's failure on UN Resolution 1441 and paints Bush out to be hungary for another war in Iraq.  His economic ideas were good, too bad he had to stick his liberal nose in business that was none of his whatsoever.	2004-04-30

The excellent work, 'Worse Than Watergate ' should be read by everyone in America. What we independents hate is that Bush lied over and over and over about the Iraqi threat and The War. He also lied about his military record and even here in Austin it is well known his 'friends' cleaned up his military records while he was governor of Texas. This book should be titled 'The Price of Whores'!!!! <br />By reading this book, you can gain an inside view of what is happening inside the White House. You can see how this dysfunctional administration is controlled by the political arm headed by Karl Rove and Dick Cheney, and how they viciously pursue their radical right agenda without much concern for the real world or hard facts. <BR>If you care about the future of America, you should pick this up before the election, so that you can make an informed choice. God save us from the power broker politicians and their hidden agendas. <BR>What exactly IS the \\"case against Clinton\\"?

Crimes don't get any higher than that. And consider that \\"Watergate\\" and \\"Iraqgate\\" are REPUBLICAN scandals.  Nixon was forced to resign. Don't you think Bush should resign or be impeached by the same Republican logic?<br />On a lighter note, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" It features a 15 year-old crack whore performing fellatio and depicts more murders than does Ludacris' hit album \\"Word of Mouf\\". <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give tax breaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<br />This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s. Conservatives wake up; you are paying for corporate welfare.

The only FREE PRESS we have left is the individual author and researcher like Woodward, who makes us think and evaluate our biased corporate-media feed and mal-nurtured minds. As a life long moderate Republican, I cannot let my ideology and prejudices obscure the fact that our President is the most ignorant, deceitful, flippant, embarrassing, and shameful President during my lifetime. I'm 60+ and have voted Republican since Eisenhower. Infringement of our Constitution and Bill of Rights all under the guise of National Security does not bode well for the US and our children's future. <br />The author clearly knows his facts and can prove them. He outlines and reveals the massive lies, propaganda, and deceit of Bush and the neo-cons leading up to the Iraq war. An un-called for war, and a war that put U.S. Soldiers in harms way, needlessly. All the while the Bush administration was cutting military pay, combat pay, and Veterans benefits. Not to mention the billions he cut from the Veteran's Administration budget, denying aid to newly disabled veterans. Shame on them, but mostly shame on our President.<br />The frantic, blind, and zealous followers of King Bush, (King because he was appointed by the Supreme Court and not elected), <BR>Rant and Rave that this is yet another lying assault on their hero.<br />If this is a book of lies, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Perhaps because, our \\"Republicant and donut read wells.\\" (Sorry, my attempt at humor)<br />Seems like the standards of Presidential excellence; the ability to orate and write brilliantly, the deep understanding of history, politics, and the Constitution/Bill of Rights, have died. Shamefully this President has the lowest IQ of ANY President in the history of our country. Several independent studies have evaluated his IQ or lack thereof. It appears a President can start an illegal war, invade a foreign country based on outright lies and deceit, and be a hero to about 50% ofAmericans. What does that say about that particular segment of our citizens? People who refuse to find and seek the truth and act on it; people who value bluster, bragging, showing off, insincerity, lying, passing the buck, and puffery over intellect, truthfulness, and fairness. Read Woodward, and astute, intelligent, logical author with actual facts. <br />Woodward, Clarke, Dean, and the list goes on; are heroes, even if I don't always agree with them, they all have one thing in common. They give us different points of views, decent, alternative arguments, which make ourselves objective and aware. Soldiers, firemen, and policemen are heroes because the risk their lives for us every day, usually unappreciated and underpaid. Why has my president dishonored my fellow American Veterans by not having time to attend NOT ONE funeral of a soldier from a war he started. Yet he's taken more vacations and spent more time at home than ANY President in history. You cannot discount Woodward, he is a savvy Washington reporter and insider who can back up his FACTS, FACTS, and more FACTS! <br />On other conspiracies: if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

It is highly weighted towards creationism and the credentials of the author are impressive.  He provides some compelling reasons to support the view that the earth is young (~6,000 years old) and expounds upon problems within the evolution model of the origins of the species.<br />While reading the book, I became angry at the evolution community.  The scientific community, by definition, should be open to alternative interpretations of scientific data yet they will not even acknowledge the possibility that the creation model better fits the data.  This is a debate on a subject that cannot be scientifically verified in a repeatable manner, but instead relies upon assumptions and interpretations.  In spite of this, the scientific community treats evolution as a fact.<br />The main argument that the author focuses on is that God created all plants, animals, and humans.  The initial creation contained all the genetic information we currently see.  The fewer \\"kinds\\" or original animals have diversified into species that have lost genetic information. Evolution requires the gaining of genetic information which is major difficulty of evolution.   <br />I have read some of the other reviews criticizing certain arguments in the book that I have not investigated as to their validity.  Even if the criticisms are valid, they have not even touched the breadth of subject matter contained within the book.  <br />I consider myself an intellectual Christian.  Yes, there are some issues that I admit that I don't understand and I do stand on faith (i.e. trinity, etc.).  But for the most part my spiritual journey is to try to understand God as best I can through scripture and the modern world.  Before reading this book, I felt discouraged from the constant refrain of the media and scientific community that this creature is so many \\"millions\\" of years old and the earth is so many \\"billions\\" of years old. After reading the book, I felt so encouraged spiritually and intellectually.  I felt that it wasn't me who was intellectually closed-minded, but the evolution community.  A good question is why would they strive so hard to destroy Christianity and religion in general. <br />The author has recently come out with a newer book that is 3 to 4 times as large.  I am currently reading it though it focuses not only on the creationism/evolution debate but also the war within Christianity between progressive evolution and creationism.  Probably a more important debate to the Christian.  About half the book is devoted to both issues since they are related.	2004-04-29

The author reproduces their tales almost in their own words. The refugees come from a variety of backgrounds.<br />It's not a bad book, but isn't very useful for a variety of reasons. The most glaring problem is the background of the refugees: a very large number of them point out &quot;I was richer/luckier/more well educated/more of a risk taker etc than usual.&quot; Is this a decent overview of all refugees in Canada? or a skewed perspective? THe author does not clarify.<br />The stories vary: some dwell on post-arrival details, and others stop when the person reaches Canada.<br />The impression given by the book was that none of the stories were verified. If they were, this information is not made very clear.<br />The stories do convey some of the confusion and difficulties of being a refugee, but invariably very subjective. The usual benefits of subjectivity apply; however, a book like this would probably be better if it had some hard data in it to clarify to the reader where (officially, for what that's worth) the readers' stories fit in comparison to other immigrants.<br />Worth getting from the library if you're after a humanistic look at refugee issues.	2004-04-29

Stephenson's very long historical novel, the sequel to Quicksilver is here! Confusion courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down with too much historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory. <br />Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics as the story continues.<br />I'm always sad to finish long novels, because life seems so mundane afterward.

In both novels, Sir John Appleby, retired Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (New Scotland Yard) is invited to a new neighbor's outdoor fête and murder ensues.  However, this time it is a charity masquerade at Drool Court, where an alarming proportion of the male guests are disguised as sheiks.<br />Sir John and his friend, Chief Constable Tommy Pride both arrive dressed as Robin Hood.  Colonel Pride has received a mysterious request from the Foreign Office that he and his men should keep an eye on the affair, but he was not informed as to what the local police were supposed to be keeping an eye on.  Appleby soon discovers that there is a genuine sheik, Emir Hafrait at the party, and furthermore he has been the target of numerous assassination attempts.  Sir John's deduction concerning Colonel Pride's assignment is verified when one of the pseudo-sheiks is found on the archery range with an arrow through his back.<br />A herpetologist laden with grass snakes and adders wanders onto the scene.  A bevy of nefarious Druids attempts to purify Drool Court, using the ancient ceremony of Perlustration.  A local troop of Boy Scouts reenacts the relief of Mafeking.  A hot air balloonist takes too many swigs out of his gin bottle and tumbles to the sward.  All of these seemingly unrelated incidents come together in a quick, glorious, tongue-firmly-in-cheek finale.<br />Innes takes many delightful twists and turns in this farcical adventure.  The only two minor problems I had with the story concern the herpetologist.  He didn't seem to know that snakes are deaf, and he referred to Appleby's adventures in &quot;The Seven Suspects&quot; (1936) as having occurred at Oxford, when in actuality our serial detective solved this particular mystery at St. Anthony's College (which was admittedly modeled after Oxford).  I honestly believe Innes worked the herpetologist into the plot just so he could include 'Adders' in his title.<br />Note to animal rights activists:  no snakes were harmed in the construction of this plot, although the Druids do not share in the generally happy ending.nto the plot just so he could include 'Adders' in his title.<br />Note to animal rights activists:  no snakes were harmed in the construction of this plot, although the Druids do not share in the generally happy ending.	2004-04-29

It is a must read for anyone with a brain who cares about America.<br />With the death toll mounting in Iraq, the WMD issue, or lack-thereof, is obviously the most disturbing thing in this book. Dean goes into deep detail toward the end of the book basically tearing apart the Presidents January 2003 State of the Union address. The Bush administration not only decieved the American people, he decieved Congress and this is valid grounds for impeachment (certainly more valid grounds for impeachment than entrapping Clinton into lying about sex - hold the presses! Someone actually lied about sex!) Equally disturbing is how John Dean describes the rollback of environmental protection laws, which this book states is over 200 laws rolled back since Bush took office. <br />This book is richly footnoted and almost all this information can be verified with a computer and internet access.<BR> <BR>For me personally there is one line toward the beginning of the book that I personally find the most disturbing. It is on page xvi of the preface:<br />\\"Equally worthy of attention is their hidden agenda to end federal entitlement programs by running up budget-busting deficits while hiking military spending, which is bleeding the federal treasury and will ultimately result in there simply being no money available to pay for social programs after this administration is gone. These, of course, are programs - such as Social Security and Medicare - that they dare not eliminate.\\"<br />So now it becomes clear the reason for the massive Bush tax cuts, whichdisproportionately go to the super rich.	2004-04-29

With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.<br />The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.<br />The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms.<br />It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.<br />Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.<br />Here's how 1984 applies to current events:<br />WAR IS PEACE<br />The new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;<br />FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br />&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.<br />IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH<br />America's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.<br />When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell is `HERE AND NOW.\\"<br />If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also:  I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over.

Sitchin, the scientist, the archeologist, the Sumerian expert, is one of the leading figures in alternative archaeology and science in general. Earth Chronicles is the pinnacle of his erudite career.<br />I have been a fan of Sitchin for years and have read most of his books, but &quot;The Twelfth Planet was my favorite of all. He lays it all out; from Biblical text, ancient Sumerian writings and obscure writings, to reveal that in ancient times UFOnauts from other worlds did indeed visit and influence our ancient civilizations greatly. Then he wrote `Earth Chronicles,\\" destined to be his best work yet.<br />These days, and especially the last 30-40 years, a &quot;new wave&quot; of scientists and non-scientists alike has risen with the intention of re-examining what we as a species consider &quot;knowledge&quot;, knowledge about what we are, and where we come from. Sitchin, being one of the few people in the world who can actually read Sumerian, has spent his life examining our origins, and his conclusions have little to do with apes descending trees and miraculously evolving into humans.<br />In the &quot;12th planet&quot;, his most famous of his all together 12+ books, he suggests that we are actually the creation of an alien race which landed on earth more than 450 millennia ago, and who created us as slave labor for their purposes on this planet back then. From then on, and through a myriad inter-developments and influences, we developed to what we are today.<br />Sure, this sounds controversial, and to most people content with swallowing mainstream teachings for &quot;facts&quot; this might seem as pure science fiction. You would have to read this book before you term it as such though. <br />\\"Earth Chronicles\\" is an exhausting book too, as the author uses literally 100s of quotes on original translations he's made in order to make his argument and this isn't just any argument, you understand...<br />Sitchin isn't just another quack with a theory, he is an eminent Orientalist, respected Biblical scholar, expert Sumerian archeologist, and recognized leader in revealing the real truth in the enigmas of ancient civilizations and history especially related to Sumerians, Hebrews, their Gods, and cultures in the middle-east. The unpublished photographic evidence alone is worth the read and the price. times. Were ancient Gods visitors to Earth from another planet? Are we not alone? Have others influenced our civilization and evolution? This read is an adventure, an eye opener, a thrill, an education, and fun as hell!  A tour guide to our future with beacons from the past.<br />If you read this excellent book, you will know that it is indeed the truth. Two well-respected American Astronauts have come forward to proclaim they had seen evidence of the Roswell UFO crash and stated they know the cover-up is real. You be the judge. Read this book. <br />You ever wondered why we are the only species on this planet that definitely does not fit in with its environment? Or why we have so many gray areas and disagreements about where we originate from and how? Or why the word &quot;anthropos&quot; (a Greek word) means &quot;the creature that always looks up&quot;? Or even why the root word of the word &quot;earth&quot; comes from the ancient Sumerian (the word e.ri.du) and means &quot;a home far away&quot;?<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's best-selling 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program 'insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over.

What it reveals is stunning when compared to current events. And deeply disturbing.<br />However, you must read the first book first to fully appreciate the second book.<br />I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of negative reviews of this book were not the work of some of his former colleagues, or 'ordinary' citizens engaged to write for them. Any astute and extraordinarily well-read person can determine that the facts Ostrovsky states about various operations in his book have the definite ring of truth about them. They can be verified with contemporaneous news accounts, available now on microfiche at any large American library that houses world newspapers.<br />I lived in NYC while most of the events he describes were going on, and kept up daily with a broad variety of news sources worldwide. I was front and center when these stories broke. Ostrovsky's account fills in the nagging questions the various accounts presented at the time, and confirm what I was hearing under the table as suspicions from our intelligence sources.	2004-04-24

The plot weaves like an intricate children's bedside story. But the book is not literature by any means or definition. When people are too ignorant to read history and theology, you concoct a fable written to the sixth grade reading level based on two men's interpretation of the Bible. It's kind of like `Religion For Dummies', or `Compassion - For Members Only.'  Holy Blood - Holy Grail is a superior read.<br />The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the five star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:<br />In `Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew `and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is `not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, `and then' His dead body was hung on a `tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text. <br />The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <br />The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In `I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made `a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an `idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was `idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />The authors claim this is not speculative fiction, but what will happen, more or less, when the rest of us are `Left Behind.' Good riddance, I say. And take all the fundamentalist Muslim fanatics, who are of the same blind ilk, with you.  This is a must read for skeptics of truth and devout fundamentalist zealot Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

US	26032123	R2P3E7FLAARGGJ	0553381903	752867547	My Losing Season: A Memoir	Books	1	13	38	N	N	an admirable introduction followed by  bathos and howlers	A memoir is by definition a re-creation, and no such work can possibly be completely factual, nor should it be.  But after a promising introduction which candidly reveals the author's personal struggles -- struggles all too common in men, especially Southern men -- this work lapses into bathos and what strikes me in one instance as a completely unbelievable &quot;event&quot; in the author's life -- and I am a speaking as a native Georgian who was one of two white players on one of the first desegregated teams in that state's history.<br />The bathos is typified by what I call the &quot;Bob Costas Syndrome&quot;: it is possible to enjoy sports intensely without referring to a high school point guard's exploits as &quot;magnificent&quot; and &quot;heroic&quot;; not even Michael Jordan at his greatest was &quot;heroic.&quot;  Jackie Robinson was heroic indeed, butleast of all for his amazing athletic skills. As I write this the news of the death of another American soldier in Afghanistan is playing on every channel: a former NFL player who walked away from the &quot;heroic&quot; &quot;war zone&quot; of the football field and from millions of dollars to enlist with his brother as an Army Ranger.  Sports may possibly build character, a debate which sports increasingly seems to be losing, but PLEASE spare me the grandiose adjectives. Perhaps NOW we will have a moratorium on writers and athletes employing hyperbolic terms such as &quot;warrior&quot; etc. Such romanticizing betrays a poverty of vision especially insulting in our current epoch.<br />The &quot;event&quot; I find completely incredible centers on a supposed train-trip encounter in the early 1960s between the author and an African American girl (who curiously remains unnamed, though the author tells us he &quot;was in love with her&quot; and though he seems to remember the names of every opposing player, coach, referee, and gym custodian from his kindergarten through college years).  This young woman, travelingalone (luckily for her and the author, on one of the only desegregated trains in 1960s America), sits down VOLUNTARILY across from the white author, who subsequently reveals he is from the South. This revelation being a famous ice-breaker with African Americans in the 60s, they become friendly, their meeting just happens to coincide with MLK's &quot;Dream&quot; speech, which they conveniently just happen to be able to pick up on am radio on a moving train, and they even tour Cincinatti together on a stopover.<br />Perhaps this young African American woman was from Mars, not the United States. Perhaps her parents actually did put her on a train alone and encouraged her to strike up conversations with  white boys, especially Southern white boys.  Perhaps they encouraged her to WALK AROUND ONE OF THE MOST RACIALLY DIVISIVE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY WITH AFOREMENTIONED WHITE BOY. But based on my experiences as a Southerner who grew up in the maelstrom, the epicenter of the Civl Rights Era, I find such an &quot;event&quot; completely fantastic: the sad truth is that no woman of color in the South could afford or would dare initiate a playful Q and A with a white male on a train (especially one traveling from Nebraska-- hardly a bastion of civil rights itself -- to the Deep South).<br />This nameless woman of course cannot be tracked down (and therefore, conveniently, the story cannot be verified nor proven false).  Thus she remains, in my view, a princess in a wish-fulfillment fairy tale of a world that never existed in a South and a United States that was and remains much more racist than most white people can or will admit.<br />After all, what fate ultimately befell the great orator who uttered the &quot;Dream&quot; speech that Conroy and his fairy princess supposedly listened to so rapturously?<br />And how are we to believe the author's contention that sports builds noble traits when we are confronted with such a risibly unbelievable &quot;event&quot;?<br />Perhaps Conroy thereby makes more points about sports then he intends. Certainly this &quot;event,&quot; clearly designed to show how progressive and good hearted the author was for his place and time, insults the memory of the deathless speech that it invokes.	2004-04-24

Being a born-again Christian, I can understand that this is a hard pill to swallow when you've been taught your whole life that the Catholic Church is the 'only' religion.  I was raised around all the Catholics, and even went to church with them sometimes, and never heard a moving, life changing sermon.  I saw a lot of rituals, dipping fingers into 'holy water', bowing before entering the pew, puppeting various phrases in response to the priests' words.  Even the Bible writes to be careful of saying the same words over and over like a parrot so that it becomes meaningless.  I got saved when I was 16 yrs old, I heard the truth and I knew that accepting Jesus in my heart was what I needed.  Our family never went to church when I was a kid, though mom taught us about right and wrong from a Godly perspective.  There are many faulty doctrines in Catholocism, especially when you can do 'penance' to get into heaven, or 'pay' someone to pull you out of the fires of purgatory (which is totally unbiblical) \\"It is appointed unto man once to die, then the judgement\\" Hebrews 9:27 Why did Jesus have to come and suffer a horrible death if we could get to heaven BY OUR OWN WORKS!!!!!! If we could \\"pay\\", or we can 'confess', or say prayers to an earthly woman (Mary) and expect her to hear us all as if she were a god, this all gives Christ a slap in the face.  The info in this book is well documented, and has been verified through many authors.  A great read is '50 years in the church of Rome' by Charles Chiniquy, he's an ex-priest who was TRYING to serve God in the midst of a religion that never addressed the priests getting drunk, sleeping with the nuns or the priests own confessors, as you can see whats happening now with the pedophilia that the church never addresses, only takes the guilty priests and puts them across the country.  They don't inform them that it's against Gods law to hurt young children like that???? How can anyone call that a Christian institution.  This book speaks for itself when you look at the state of the Catholic church today.  It's a 'feel good' religion, live like you please, then come to church, do your confession, say your penance, make a few signs of the cross on your body and you FEEL like everything is OK, think again!!.  Also go to the website chick.com.  It was started by Alberto Rivera, an EX-JESUIT PRIEST that tells you what he was taught, and their mission here on earth, and it certainly wasn't Peace and Love.  They eventually killed him for his defection.  When you read Chiniquy or Rivera's account, you see that they give all the glory to God, and don't focus on themselves. the Bible states in 1 Cor 2:14 'For the natural man receives not the things of God, neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned'.  You have to re-awaken your spirit, it's naturally dead from our sin nature passed from Adam, then you will understand God, for He is spirit. Read this book!	2004-04-23

As a life long moderate Republican, I cannot let my ideology and prejudices obscure the fact that our President is the most ignorant, deceitful, flippant, embarrassing, and shameful President during my lifetime. I'm 60+ and have voted Republican since Eisenhower. Infringement of our Constitution and Bill of Rights all under the guise of National Security does not bode well for the US and our children's future. <br />The author clearly knows his facts and can prove them. He outlines and reveals the massive lies, propaganda, and deceit of Bush and the neo-cons leading up to the Iraq war. An un-called for war, and a war that put U.S. Soldiers in harms way, needlessly. All the while the Bush administration was cutting military pay, combat pay, and Veterans benefits. Not to mention the billions he cut from the Veteran's Administration budget, denying aid to newly disabled veterans. Shame on them, but mostly shame on our President.<br />The frantic, blind, and zealous followers of King Bush, (King because he was appointed by the Supreme Court and not elected), <BR>Rant and Rave that this is yet another lying assault on their hero. If this is a book of lies, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Perhaps because, our \\"Republicant and donut read wells.\\" (Sorry, my attempt at humor)<br />Seems like the standards of Presidential excellence; the ability to orate and write brilliantly, the deep understanding of history, politics, and the Constitution/Bill of Rights, have died. Shamefully this President has the lowest IQ of ANY President in the history of our country. Several independent studies have evaluated his IQ or lack thereof. It appears a President can start an illegal war, invade a foreign country based on outright lies and deceit, and be a hero to about 50% of Americans. What does that say about that particular segment of our citizens? People who refuse to find and seek the truth and act on it; people who value bluster, bragging, showing off, insincerity, lying, passing the buck, and puffery over intellect, truthfulness, and fairness. Read Woodward, and astute, intelligent, logical author with actual facts. <br />Woodward, Clarke, Dean, and the list goes on; are heroes, even if I don't always agree with them, they all have one thing in common. They give us different points of views, decent, alternative arguments, which make ourselves objective and aware. Soldiers, firemen, and policemen are heroes because the risk their lives for us every day, usually unappreciated and underpaid. Why has my president dishonored my fellow American Veterans by not having time to attend NOT ONE funeral of a soldier from a war he started. Yet he's taken more vacations and spent more time at home than ANY President in history. You cannot discount Woodward, he is a savvy Washington reporter and insider who can back up his FACTS, FACTS, and more FACTS! <br />On other conspiracies: if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

Confusion courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down with too much historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory. <br />Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics as the story continues.<br />I'm always sad to finish long novels, because life seems so mundane afterward.

I decided to check it out, since it certainly looked interesting, to say the least.  This book is a real page-turner and written in a lively manner, but so is Albert Goldman's 'The Lives of John Lennon,' and that book is just as trashy and blatantly untrue as this book, though at least TLOJL does have some truth buried under all of the sensationalism and wildly exaggerated stories based on unverified anecdotes.  This book has even more problems in the truth department.<br />I myself used to be very anti-Orthodox, since I got my picture of that denomination from the crazy fanatics always in the media, flamers and hate-mongers on the Jewish Community boards on aol, and disgruntled women who'd left Orthodoxy, on those same boards.  I never even really knew any Orthodox people until my senior year of college, though my opinion of them had been softening a bit before then.  The people I knew, the Orthodox, Modern Orthodox, Lubavitchers, Traditional Orthodox, etc., are nothing like the horrible people Mrs. Kaye says she grew up around.  I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she did have a terrible experience growing up, but could it be that adolescent rebellion or a drastic early adulthood break with all of the traditions she was raised with have coloured her perceptions and given her a false hindsight?  None of the Orthodox I've known love embarrassing people, feel it is their duty to embue their kids with discomfort and insecurity, nor are they racists or sexists.  This woman must not know that there are many Jews of colour, black, brown, yellow, tan, etc., and more of them than you'd think are born Jews instead of converts.  She is perpetrating the old myth that only Ashkenazic Jews exist or count, ignoring the many Jews whose origins are not in Eastern or Central Europe but in Italy, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Algeria, China, India, South America, etc.  She also claims that a devout Orthodox Jew violently hates all non-Jews and believes all manner of stereotypes about them, like they're all druggies, drunks, have horrible family lives, and are anti-Semites and untrustworthy.  I'm sorry if she grew up in such a hateful self-imposed ghetto like she says she did, but you can't discredit all of Orthodoxy by just one bad experience, as awful as it was!  She never even thought to try a different community or a different synagogue to see if she might have a more positive experience elsewhere.<br />I myself am not Orthodox, though I feel I have it in me to be if they resolve some of their issues about womens' roles, for example.  I have had only very positive experiences praying, eating, celebrating, and spending time, sometimes overnight, with the Orthodox people I met at college.  Mrs. Kaye obviously had the exact opposite types of experiences, but she grew up in the Forties and Fifties.  I think pretty much women and girls everywhere in America had that type of coming of age experience in that era; Orthodox or not, girls nowadays have a lot more opportunities and aren't overlooked just because they're not boys.  And Orthodoxy has changed a lot in the past 50 years or so; if Mrs. Kaye went back, and lived in a Modern Orthodox community, I'm sure she'd be shocked to find how well-educated the girls are, and how close they are to possibly having an Orthodox female rabbi within the next 50 years.<br />This book has a lot of anger in it, and seems to be written by someone who has unresolved issues.  It would be like a book written by a rape survivor who attacks all men everywhere, or a book by someone who left Catholicism before Vatican II because the atmosphere was too stifling for him/her.  It's not that your issues aren't real and painful, just that you should discuss them with a counselor instead of publishing them in a book before you've even tried to move past your awful past.  Mrs. Kaye can't stop spouting off lies and inaccuracies, being sarcasm and venomous, using superfluous exclamation points and capital letters, or putting words in people's mouths.  She thinks that women who say taharat hamishpacha (family purity) don't really feel like brides again and are only saying the exact same words the rabbis have told them to say.  So then all of these women are lies with no minds of their own.  She doesn't explain the true reasoning behind the morning blessing thanking God for not having made one a woman (it's very misunderstood, and I myself amn't keen on it, but it's not meant as a sexist insult).  She thinks only the Orthodox keep kosher, are shomer Shabbos and Yom Tov, clean the house for Pesach, or live any kind of observant life.  If she wants people to respect her decision to intermarry, be Reform, and completely abandon all Jewish traditions, she should respect people on the exact opposite of the spectrum.  On more than one occasion she completely insults the entire Talmud, and seemingly is ignorant to the fact that not all opinions are that of major rabbis, and if they are, no one opinion is meant to be taken as the only truth, such as on medical views of the time.  That's like wondering why President Washington was bled to death and his doctors laughed at the young doctor who wanted to do a tracheotomy; you're unfairly holding a different era to a modern standard and all of the hindsight and knowledge which has occured since then.  Most insulting of all is that she just can't believe any thinking woman would want to be Orthodox or Hassidic and is a brainwashed liar parroting what men have told her to say, and that these women have given up their minds and are living like ignorant peasant women in isolated African villages.  God forbid an intelligent modern woman should see the beauty in an Orthodox life and decide to join them, and still be a feminist while living a traditional Jewish life.  She is ignorant to the fact that the ketubah is insurance against a bad husband and is much fairer to women than practically every other culture at the time was to women.  And the list goes on and on.<br />Mrs. Kaye sadly doesn't want to leave her preconceived ideas behind her and actually listen to what the other side has to say, without already having her mind made up they're crazy, sexist, or parroting the rabbis.  Like Eleanor Roosevelt said, \\"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\\"outing off lies and inaccuracies, being sarcasm and venomous, using superfluous exclamation points and capital letters, or putting words in people's mouths.

Muktananda writes from both the perspectives of having been a disciple of an enlightened Master and as a Guru who has much to teach sincere aspirants on the inner path.  His words carry the conviction of actual experience; this is not a theortical treatise on the ultimate meaning of life and human potential.  It is rather a testament to what happens when the power of grace and the longing of a true seeker meet.  The intention of this book is not to inspire a belief about the enlightened state of Muktananda; but rather to impart a description of essential truth to the reader which is meant to be verified by actual experience.	2004-04-19
US	50304758	R23LNW4MIF8WMB	0972883584	517134930	Confessions of a God Seeker: A Journey to Higher Consciousness	Books	5	19	27	N	Y	Reveals the Cult of Eckankar and a New Spiritual Paradigm	I find the two 1 star reviews of this book to be rather silly, and 1 dimensional. Eckists are really frightened of this book because it shatters the illusion of the world of Eckankar that was created for them and by them. <br />The one reviewer complains that the author is too &quot;cerebral&quot; and yet one must use the mind for discernment. If one wants to judge on the basis of emotion or using the heart center then they will not go beyond the Astral Plane. One must use a conbination of faculties including nudges, common sense, logic, feelings, and knowingness. Also, I had &quot;personal experiences&quot; before, during and after Eckankar. I only just now discovered that the Masters and Mahanta were actually my own Self as God-soul. Therefore, true spiritual freedom is now experienced on a level never before attained!<br />Another reviewer seemed to think that if one finds fault with Eckankar that something must be wrong with them rather than Eckankar. To pray, contemplate, or meditate on a daily basis is a process of dying daily it is said. Everyone has this ability, but one must have a pure heart and those involved in the Eckankar cover-up cannot be pure. People who try to use the excuse of it's only &quot;human errors&quot; are also overlooking the Eckankar spin that these three eck masters (Twitchell, Gross, and Klemp) are supposed to be the most spiritually advanced supermen on the planet or in all universes and Planes! Even to take the standards down several levels would show these three to be a pitiful selection! The reviewer goes on to say that if this (Eckankar) is made up then it's the best story ever and that he has fallen in love. Well, some people love to be in love, and need to have something greater to believe in than the Truth of who they really are (God-soul). <br />It is easy to put someone on a pedestal as a hero or savior than to take responsibility for your own Mastership in this here and now! People don't need priests (clergy) or mahantas tocontinue the lies that attach them to dependency rather than the independency of spiritual freedom. Twitchell Westernized Radasoami Satsang and used &quot;The Path of the Masters&quot; by Julian P. Johnson as his guide. Ford Johnson points this out in his book and I have verified this information for myself. Take your time reading this book. It's better if you also take the time to verify the info given and contemplate on these revelations. I also highly suggest that this book be re-read after several months for further clarity.	2004-04-10

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" <br />Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" It (...) depicts more murders than does Ludacris' hit album \\"Word of Mouf\\". <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give tax breaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<BR>This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. <br />I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s. Conservatives wake up; you are paying for corporate welfare. Al Frankin's thoughts are right on. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over.

US	44820013	R2CSC4TT79AFTX	078144165X	840969768	Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts	Books	5	128	190	N	N	The Code Decoded	A new category of book has arisen during our troubled, postmodern times.  Often widely acclaimed, sometimes extremely popular, always playing fast and loose with known and verified history, these books claim to have uncovered the real facts about a particular topic, be it Christian origins (books by John Dominic Crossan, Elaine Pagels, and various members of the Jesus Seminar), the Catholic Church's relationship to the Jews (John Carroll), or Christianity's understanding of homosexuality (John Boswell).  What they really do is engage in a kind of disreputable approach to research, what I term \\"advocacy scholarship.\\"  They share a common understanding: If their core insight is valid (or just fashionable)--e.g., Jesus came to destroy \\"the brokered kingdom\\" (Crossan), Gnostic Christianity is just as true as Orthodox Christianity (Pagels), homosexuality is a valid lifestyle (Boswell), traditional Catholicism is repressive and enslaving (Carroll)--they are justified in using disreputable practices such as extremely selective use of sources, false attribution, \\"cooking\\" the data, and just plain falsification of history.<br />These books all have one thing in common: they claim to present an \\"alternate history,\\" one that has been suppressed by powerful forces of tyranny, usually for political reasons.  The alternate history they present will enable readers to free themselves from tyrannies of their own times, be they religious, political, or social.  Seeking to place themselves in a long line of freedom movements, they borrow the language of social and political liberation and misapply it to their topic at hand.  I call these works fake history.  They find an audience (sometimes incredibly large) because of two factors that plague our postmodern times: 1) nearly ubiquitous ignorance on the part ofaverage \\"educated\\" individuals in the West; and 2) the rise of a view that all narratives are equally valid.<br />Perhaps the worst of all these books is Dan Brown's wildly fantastical work posing as history, The Da Vinci Code.  Let us be clear up front.  Dan Brown has every right to write a novel that presents his understanding of Christian origins, the glories of paganism, the marvels of the sacred feminine, the horrors of Orthodox Christianity, and the liberating power of goddess religion.  My objection to his work has nothing to do with whether or not he is free to express his opinion on such topics.  My objection to him and his methods is that he claims to present a true, sustainable, historically accurate picture of what really has happened when in reality there is little or no evidence for his claims, although he acts as if there is, both throughout the book and in subsequent appearances on talk shows and in interviews.  This is simply disreputable.  He is nothing more than a somewhat higher class of snake-oil salesman, a shill for discredited ideas, a mouthpiece for historical inanity that cannot be supported at the most basic level of serious inquiry.  Somehow, he has managed to pull of this shameful scam, due largely to massive ignorance on the part of his readers combined with a deep desire on their part to find an alibi for their own wayward impulses toward license which are celebrated and blessed in this scurrilous work.<br />Thank goodness for Messieurs Garlow and Jones.  Men of no little standing in the world of thought and letters (one with a Ph.D. in historical theology from Drew University, the other with a Ph.D. from Princeton), authors of a baker's dozen of books, they have taken up the gauntlet thrown down by Dan Brown and produced a very readable response to--let's not mince words here--his idiotic book.<br />What I admire about Cracking Da Vinci's Code is the care the authors take in exposing this fraudulent work, all the while maintaining a cheerful good humor and writing in a very popular and approachable style.  True, they have little time for Brown's fake history, but they have the good manners to engage it seriously and without rancor at the level of the adequacy of its presentation of facts (something I find impossible to do when faced with nonsense of this kind).  This would hardly have been necessary if the book had been written in a different genre, such as alternate history science fiction--but then it would've lost its cache, its frisson, its stance (albeit false) as authentic history, wouldn't've it?<br />Along the way, they clearly show that there is absolutely no foundation for its appalling claims, such as the idea that the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus came about as the result of a politically motivated vote by the Council of Nicaea; that alternative, \\"Gnostic\\" gospels were written earlier than the four gospels in the New Testament and present a truer understanding of who Jesus was than the Christian gospels; that there is evidence that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and that they had a child; that the Church has suppressed this evidence because it would undermine its power and break the hold it has on the faithful; that the Church killed more than five million women in a brutal attempt at \\"reeducation\\"; and lots more similar idiocy.<br />I have only two quibbles, and these are entirely minor.  First, I don't think the book are fairly describes the post-Constantine Church; and second, I'm not entirely taken with their running chapter-opening narrative concerning a young woman who is struggling to make up her mind about the value of The Da Vinci Code.  Regarding the first quibble, it has become fairly standard for Protestant church historians to discredit the post-Constantine church, so it's not unexpected (although one might wish for a more nuanced approach).  Regarding the second, I can see the usefulness to situate the dilemma Brown's book poses for the historically illiterate by creating a story to help readers find existential connecting points; for me, however, it was a little heavy-handed.  <br />Nevertheless, this is quite a good book, certainly worth checking out, especially for those who, credulously, have taken the historicity of The Da Vinci Code at face value.  4 and 1/2 stars.	2004-04-08

This book is rather well-researched, and Ann Coulter uses Lexis-Nexis extensively, which is why you hear liberals squawking so much in a wounded furor: she has found their own words, indisputable, in context, to be verified for anyone willing to follow up on her research ('no shred of evidence' is clearly untrue). (...)That Coulter has the chapter content comprising six times the bibliography, again, is a testament to her meticulous methodology. You will not see this type of studious research in Al Franken's or Michael Moore's book(s). A six to one ratio is not bad for research notes.    (...)Her invective humour is only funny though if you are not 'liberal'. Her words sting, but she predicates jocularity on fact, and the prose bites with her cynicism about the liberal world-view.    Her tenacious grasp on Christianity may put some off if they are not especially religious, or agnostic, as I am, but nonetheless, her words have logic and a general commonsense. You would have to be rather indoctrinated by the propaganda of the left and socialists, or severely daft, to deny any basis for many of the claims she makes.     She makes the distinction, albeit indirectly, between treason in defense of America, and treason against it. The former liberals and world-government socialists fall into the latter.    (To answer the 'review' below: Nixon commited crimes, perhaps, but they were not treason against his country. He was never charged with treason, just a matter of breaking the law, none of which were traitorous. There is a difference.     (...)Reagan, on the other hand, brought the hostages HOME, after weak-willed Carter left them to rot in Iran. Again, even if Reagan had 'played with the lives' of the Teheran hostages, this isn't treason: America has a policy of non-negotiation with terrorists. Even so, Reagan brought them home, some 444 days later.     Finally, Oliver North is a patriot for using money from Iran to fight Communists in Nicaragua. Indeed, he broke the law, and Reagan is known to have not really known, or perhaps only been informed of the operation in part. At worst, this wasn't treason because the act was FOR America, not against it. Only a liberal would be unable to make that distinction.)       She also makes the distinction between the claim that modern liberals are an intellectual descendancy from Jefferson, and who liberals really are: socialists from a page of Theodore Adorno's life work.     Claimed to be hate speech, the left-leaning fasicist have no desire to have the truth set out, plainly, clearly, and with an acerbic spin of humour.(...) Readable, the syle is simple and concise    Finally, her comparison between Communists and contemporary socialist Democrats and librals is clear: she compares them not only because much of their ideology is similar and has the same root, but because they both work to erase the memory of this countries' foundations by changing it inexorably to a fascist, immoral state. The left calls the right fascist, but only the left tries to pass fascism into law.	2004-04-06

Most people in these nations view capitalism with skepticism.  To them it is a private apartheid system that benefits only the West and the elites of the developing countries.  The fact that more people throughout the world wear Nike shoes; flash Casio watches; drive Ford cars and dine at Mc Donalds; is not an indicator of capitalism. <br />The Issue:<BR>Latin Americans do not have to be reminded.  On at least four occasions since their independence from Spain in the 1820's, they have tried to become part of global capitalism and failed.  They restructured their debts; stabilized their economies by controlling inflation; liberalized trade; privatized government assets; undertook debt equity swaps and overhauled their tax systems.  At the consumer level they imported all sorts of American and European goods.  But their lack of success is in their misplaced directive.  Fact lifeblood of capitalism is placed in nothing but Capital. <br />The Resolution:<BR>Desoto has taken a very pragmatic approach to the problem; by taking both a historical approach as to how the West traveled the path of Capitalism and undertaking a detailed research in the extent of dead capital stagnant in the developing world.  He professes that just like the west in the early days; in the developing world there was a migration of people to cities during the industrialization. This migration created squatter colonies; and around them developed supporting economy.  Bureaucracy and painful property registration system (taking 14-17 years); prevents registration of property.  In essence creating dead capital;  in such a system nobody can identify who owns what; addresses cannot be verified; people cannot get credit or debits; resources (land assets) cannot be converted into money or securities, description ofassets are not standardized and cannot be easily compared; and rules of property law changes from neighborhood to neighborhood. By streamlining the registration of dead property lying outside the legal system eliminates all the issues above; and benefits the people by making credit/debit easily accessible to them, by taking loans with property as a security.<br />Facts:<BR>Desoto from his years of research of underground economies taken from a very varied group of countries (Haiti, Egypt, Philippines, Peru) has found some very startling facts about dead capital.<BR>In Egypt the Dead capital is 241,2 Billion, which is 55X foreign direct investment (FDI) up to 1996, 30X market value of Cairo Stock Exchange; 13X accumulated foreign reserves; 6X total savings in commercial banks in Egypt.  <BR>In Philippines the Dead capital is 132,9 Billion ; which is 14X total FDI; 7X total savings in commercial banks; 4X market value of Philippines Stock Exchange.<BR>In Peru the Dead capital is 74,2 Billion; which is 14X FDI up to 1995; 11X capital of the largest public enterprises in Peru; 8X total savings in commercial banks in Peru.	2004-04-02

With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.<br />The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted.<br />This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.<br />The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms. It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.<br />Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.<br />Here's how 1984 applies to current events:<br />WAR IS PEACE<br />The new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;<br />FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br />&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.<br />IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH<br />America's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.<br />When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell is `HERE AND NOW.\\"<br />If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also:  I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away.

Codes, ciphers, Enigma, American Black Chamber.....If any of these words intrigue you then Digital Fortress by Dan Brown might just be a book for you. For many years I have been interested in all facets of intelligence, from David Kahn's book, The Codebreakers to James Bamford's, The Puzzle Palace. <br />These works described the processes from breaking codes and ciphers to how one of America's most secret organizations orchestrates the massive responsibility of gathering and interpreting all type and matter of intelligence. Dan Brown has done his research well in the creation of this novel. He has created characters that are very down to earth and very believable. <br />The story itself is centered around the NSA, National Security Agency, how it operates, what it does and what it would like to do. Susan Fletcher a very intelligent and beautiful intellectual who is the head of the Crypto Group and her boyfriend David Becker, a university professor with a proclivity for languages, get entangled in some very interesting and dangerous situations. The action comes very fast and is well written. Brown puts several twists into this tale of the intelligence world and how it totally revolves around high powered computers and unbreakable algorithms. <br />If you are a fan of techno fiction than you will find this a great and entertaining read.

The type of resources utilized and the depth of research employed can measure objectivity, in my opinion. &quot;FDR's Folly&quot; stands up well to an objective reader. Jim Powell has heavily researched this work, and provides a litany of sources ranging from forensic accountants to reputable economic sources. Moreover, he bases his conclusions on accepted economic principles that he applies to the historical facts that can be independently verified.<br /><br /> This book demonstrates that the policies promulgated by Roosevelt and his advisors exacerbated an economic disaster. It is a fact that economic systems experience growth and recession in the same manner that natural systems experience periods of abundance and scarcity. How we &quot;weather these conditions&quot; is often impacted more by our remedial approaches to address them rather then the events themselves. Powell proves that the New Dealers &quot;...overestimated the importance of their knowledge, as opposed to the knowledge of millions of ordinary people spending their own money and running their businesses.&quot; In fact, &quot; The New Dealers really came to believe that their knowledge, combined with political power, could cure the problems of the world. They thought that by issuing executive orders, passing laws, raising taxes, and redistributing money, they could make society better.&quot; It turns out that most of these policies did more to reduce the standard living, increase unemployment, and actually prolong the depression. A clear case of where less would have been more.<br /><br /> In chapter after chapter, Jim Powell presents conclusions around these themes and then provides clear and plain evidence for his conclusions. Of greater importance, this book destroys the myth of Roosevelt as a great savior during the depression. Moreover, it appears that every president since Roosevelt, whether Democrat or Republican, continues to utilize governmental intervention to solve economic policies despite the proven failures of Roosevelt's administration. In making these points, Powell uses a writing style that is concise yet detailed, and he presents a potentially boring subject in an interesting and thought provoking manner.<br /><br /> The lessons from this book should be studied, debated, and followed.t appears that every president since Roosevelt, whether Democrat or Republican, continues to utilize governmental intervention to solve economic policies despite the proven failures of Roosevelt's administration.

The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <br />The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the one star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:<br />In `Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew `and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is `not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, `and then' His dead body was hung on a `tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text. <br />The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In `I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made `a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an `idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was `idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />As a student of history I applaud the fresh approach to history and literary criticism this book embodies. The nature of this work is admittedly controversial - but then it must be as `The Templar Revelation' breaks bold new ground. Research the genre and decide for yourself, but this book is a must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"	2004-03-28

Of course the people that are claiming that this book is full of lies, are the very same people that haven't even bothered to check the accuracy. Perhaps because they never even read this book.They are just so closed minded that they refuse to acknowledge the truth, even when it is larger than life. They probably are the same people that claimed we needed to invade another Country because of the serious threat of being attacked with WMD's. Since they are so hung up on what the truth is in this book, perhaps they should also be so strongly opinionated when it comes to finding those WMD's. Of course, they give the President a &quot;free pass&quot; on that issue. Ah heck, let's be honest, they give the President a &quot; free pass&quot; on just about anything he lies about or messes up. This book is a no nonsense book. Anyone that actually takes the time to read it could easily see that the book is done very honestly and from the heart. Anyone that says otherwise probably has a lot to hide and be ashamed of. I find it offensive that as soon as any other Republican or Democrat has a different opinion from our President, all the other Republicans break out into their cult like mindset and start relentlessly attacking the person that actually dared to think for themselves. Very scary to have those type of people in power. It is our right as Americans to form and express our own opinions without the fear of vicious attacks. This book is loaded with truths and that is why the White House has sent out the cult like members to do damage control. They go on all the talk shows throwing out their little cult like &quot;buzz words.&quot; They repeat them over and over and over again. It's almost laughable on how they handle things in that White House. Richard Clarke is a very decent and honorable American that told the truth, even though he knew the severe personal attacks would be coming. This is a brave man. Unlike the many people in the Bush Administration, that run and hide whenever it comes to being under oath. That says a lot! Besides, I am wondering when the real &quot;War On Terror&quot; is gonna start. Weren't 15 of the 19 highjackers from 911, that were on those planes from Saudi Arabia?? Hmm, why then didn't we even say to boo to the Saudi Leaders? Oh yeah, I remember, that is because George Bush and his family is very close friends with all of them. Even though it was the Saudi's that attacked us on 911. Maybe it's time for us to wake up and really, really start looking at the facts with a clear mind. This book is full of those facts. Mr Clarke has served under 3 Republican and 1 Democratic President. Obviously he has incredible credentials. It also means that the he isn't all of the sudden going to take those credentials and throw them out the window by writing this book, unless he had lots of facts to back it up. Plain and simple! He is an extremely well spoken and intelligent person. I applaud Mr. Clarke for being such a decent and respectable man.	2004-03-28

He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" (...) <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give taxbreaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. <br />WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<BR>This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s.

After one reads John Currid's &quot;basic guide,&quot; one can see why many past conclusions are no longer accepted and why there is a great debate among archaeologists today about what archaeology has proven. Archaeology is a discipline which continues to learn.<br />Currid tells the story of how archaeology of the land of the Bible began in 1838 when Edward Robinson and Eli Smith traveled the Middle East and identified many biblical sites based upon their modern names. In 1890 William Flinders Petrie began the development of stratio-graphy and its inherent notion that each occupational layer of a mound could be dated by its pottery. After WW II Kathleen Kenyon revolutionized archaeology by digging in small squares within a grid.<br />So, of course as methods change, conclusions change.<br />Currid has written a book for someone who has little prior knowledge of archaeology. One thing that is missing is a chapter on Ground Penetrating Radar. It is interesting to read, but as the subtitle says, it is a basic guide.	2004-03-25

I got this book from a friend about two weeks ago. Let me say, from the very beginning that I AM NOT, either a follower of Ichazo, The FOF or the Mouravieff movement. It is important to establish that base, because my opinion clearly differentiates from all the above. The book is written in the style of \\"defense\\", which means, \\"since I hold the keys and the only true knowledge, let me tell you all THE NONSENSE that is going on around\\". At least that is how it sounded to me.<BR>Personally I am part of the Gurdjieff institute in So Paulo (Brazil), for fourteen years now, and before that I was a member of another group which claimed no higher pretension than being a group of sincere people searching for a \\"more balanced life\\". No one claimed to be \\"a Teacher\\", no one prophesized to have achieved higher consciousness, i.e., everyone \\"knew\\" first of all, that we needed to be humble in the first place. Why I am saying all that? Do I need to take part in the defense of the people and the groups attacked in the book? Of course not, but since the author takes the risk to criticize groups which he have never participated in, I thought that my experience in the one considered to be \\"a real one\\", could be valid at least for some people. <BR>So, lets go to some other \\"facts\\". Although I am part of the Gurdjieff institute for more than fourteen years now, I can still see, without any doubt, a lot of \\"mechanics\\" in those \\"responsible\\" for our activities here. In short that means, arrogance, vanity, struggle for power, infinite gossip, appropriate behavior towards those who are \\"wealthy\\" and many many more. To those who now ask \\"Why this guy stay in that group?, my answer is simply because, as Mr Gurdjieff says: \\"Remember that you came here because you realized the necessity to work on yourself, and only on yourself, therefore thanks everyone who gives you the opportunity to do that\\". It does not means I am nave, blind to others mechanics or mine, it means, simply, that I have strongly verified that people are people, no matter where. My work is to focus on the positive aspects of the influence I am now receiving, hoping that those efforts will, eventually, help me in the process of creating being (After all, Life is real only then, when I AM). <BR>One last thing, I have a very good friend who is a member of the FOF for many years (and seems very happy about it), and perhaps it is from him that I have that feeling that, in the end, we are all beggars, trying as best as we can to make something out of our lives. Time will be our witness of our success or our failure. <BR>To finish, I highly respect all kinds of approaches to the work, including those of the author, but I think any attempt to establish the limits to what is false from what is true, with our logical mind, will inevitably fail. Therefore my suggestion to all, keep your mind open, refrain from excessive formatory thinking, perhaps the opportunities lie exactly there, where you least thought. Forgive me for any mistake made by the use of a foreigner language.	2004-03-23

Sadly, Sean Hannity and his neocon machine insist that evil simply exists and that we, American do-gooders, must eradicate it. Yes, his understanding of the world is as profound as a two-dollar comic book. The concept of cause and effect seems to elude men like Sean Hannity, and their pathetic explanations for the horrible deeds committed in the world reduces to \\"uh oh, it must be evil!\\" <br />When you have such an utter lack of understanding about human nature, you tend to want to destroy what you do not understand. Hence the wars, hence the bitter invective, hence the rabid jingoism of men like Sean Hannity who have absolutely no desire to make the world anything else but a breeding ground for rich, privileged men.<br />Hundreds of new laws were passed after 9/11 for states to enforce; yet funds are yet to be forthcoming from Washington. Funds for Airport security, State security, Border security, Fire & Police requirements, and tracking aliens have been minimally funded. It is estimated that state taxes will have to be increased at least 12% if Bush's plan to relax immigration from our southern border are passed. <br />The U.S. Department of Labor reports the unemployment rate rose to 6 percent in November, with many of the jobless from the manufacturing and service industries. Actual unemployment, counting those who have given up looking for a job and those no longer carried by state databases puts the unemployment rate at closer to 8.7 percent. <br />Manufacturing jobs have declined for 28 months in a row.  \\"This hardship is concentrated in certain regions and in certain industries,\\" said Bush during his speech. \\"You know what I'm talking about here in the Midwest. You're showing signs of recovery here, yet many people here and across this country are still looking for work.\\" For every job created during the last three years, 1.2 jobs are lost to overseas manufacturing or outsourcing, which the administration seems unable to address.<br />- \\"It's amazing I won.I was running against peace, prosperity, and incumbency.\\" - George W.

Of course he would have been a draft dodger like his idols during the Vietnam War, just like the conservatives he blindly supports. Even if you believe this nut-case, the book is poorly written and overly-simplistic.<br />Sad to see that people actually fall for Hannity the circus clown. But, as P.T.

The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <br />The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the one star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:<BR>In `Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew `and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is `not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, `and then' His dead body was hung on a `tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text. <BR>The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In `I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made `a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an `idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was `idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />As a student of history I applaud the fresh approach to history and literary criticism this book embodies. The nature of this work is admittedly controversial - but then it must be as `The Templar Revelation' breaks bold new ground. Research the genre and decide for yourself, but this book is a must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"	2004-03-19

What an embarrassment! All he could do was to try unsuccessfully to find someone to support his views. Which became more and more embarrassing for him. This shows the quality of his work. <br />This guy was a Clinton zealot, then a GOP neocon darling. Give me a break. He's in it for the media attention and money. He has no values. Morris has not mentioned his own brush with sexual scandals with whores, himself being investigated for kickbacks and fraud, not to mention someone who called Bush senior a criminal. He's and idiot and you are too if you pay for this crap.<br />He said he never heard Powell's plagiarizing a school kids paper for his speech at the UN. This is hard to believe! And this came after he praised and praised Powell against actor Michael Sheen. When this fact was again pointed at him, he changed the subject! Can someone who is serious, write about Powell, make him an idol, but be ignorant about his UN speech, and how the world made fun of us because of his amateur attempt to sell WMD policy on Iraq by plagiarizing a school kids paper? Well, this book is written by someone who has not paid attention to his subject matter. <br />The book reflects Dick's ignorance, mediocrity, poor, one sided and cheap nationalistic propaganda. There are intelligent nationalists. Unfortunately Dick is not one of them. There are genuinely patriotic people. Dick is not one of them.<BR>If he wants to make a case for the issues he claims to defend, he has to do a lot of homework, read and learn a lot, get schooling. And occasionally read the daily newspapers. Even if it means reading the other side, so that he can make an argument against them. <br />Attacking Hollywood or France does not cut it as real criticism, which Dick cannot do, due to his lack of political knowledge. He should start by not lying publicly about factual eventswhere governments (England) have accepted and apologized while Dick claims he has no knowledge of the event! If he REALLY wants to do the right thing, first he should do a little homework... THEN write a book. This way he has a chance of persuading other people. But he should respect others' intelligence before stepping up to the soapbox. <br />Dick wants to blame 9/11 and all evil on Hollywood, liberals and people he does not like. Never a mention that Bush's papa was on Bin Laden family's payroll, but he attacks Barbara Streisand for terrorism! <br />Cheap, unintelligent nationalism. Forget the paper, it is not worth the ink spent on printing. If you want honest patriotism, or real criticism of the liberals you can find a lot of serious books where you may pick up some information, analysis and food for thought. Dick is cashing in on 9/11. Don't waste your time or money. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...unlike this claptrap, look no further.

The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, `and then' His dead body was hung on a `tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of theoriginal text. <BR>The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <BR>The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In `I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made `a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an `idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was `idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />Although many ideas are speculative, the authors nevertheless give background data just enough to shake the foundations of our 'traditional knowledge'. A must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"	2004-03-16

I have been in search of quality Lao language study materials since my first trip to Laos seven years ago.  Klaus Werner's book was, until recently, the best reference available.  Ms. Simmala and Ms. Becker have now put together a comprehensive package for getting started with this beautiful language.<br />The book and audio program (CDs and tapes available) provide an introduction to the Lao written language (with traceable characters), contemporary essential vocabulary, practice sentences, conversations for listening comprehension and practice, and essential grammar points.  An appendix also provides &quot;useful phrases&quot; for travel (also included in the audio program).  Lao friends have verified that the recorded audio is authentic and professional.<br />I recommend listening to, and repeating aloud, the vocabulary recordings for each chapter as often as necessary.  Also practice the useful phrases audio portion.  You don't need the book in front of you to do this --perfect for time in the car or walking.  Try to imagine yourself in a relevant situation as you speak the word or phrase.  <br />At the same time, start to learn and practice the Lao characters.   Then, as you learn new vocabulary, try to read &amp; write them using the Lao alphabet.  Transliteration of characters (use of roman alphabet) is difficult in Mon-Tai-Khmer languages and does not altogether capture the essential sounds and subtleties.  It is a more enriching experience to tackle Lao writing from the start.<br />There are a few supplementary materials available.  EuroTalk is supposed to produce a basic &quot;Talk Now! Lao&quot; software sometime in 2004.  Paiboon Publishing (which has produced excellent Thai language materials) has a handy Lao-English dictionary.  Lonely Planet's phrasebook is great to keep in your pocket for use anywhere/anytime you have a few minutes.<br />&quot;Sook dii!&quot; Good luck with your studies! --C4PO	2004-03-16

Once again I was lucky to get hold of a book that I couldn't wait to finish.  I've never even heard of the author but he shows great promise.  There are scenes in the book that made me laugh, feel dread and set my teeth on edge.  It must put a writer's teeth on edge to set such thoughts down on paper but to me this is what good writing is about.  Having had a few years of contact with this particular culture, I could understand most of the things the author referred to and knew what some of the recipes tasted like, like moi moi, fufu and bitter leaf soup.  The part about organ donors is true and can be verified by reading &quot;Princess&quot; or its next sequel, &quot;Daughters of Arabia&quot;, I forget which.  This must stop..but anyway this book would make a great movie.  I totally recommend it.	2004-03-16

This work compellingly investigates the relationship between Christian Gnosticism and the nescient orthodoxy in the early centuries of the Christian movement. Pagels explores the political and social implications of the coalescing orthodoxy's religious tenets, providing us something of the secular context for the elements of the Nicene creed. Such an approach could provide (and often has) a facile platform for preachy social discourse or disparagement, but Pagels is too much the scholar for this and I personally found her detachment respectable. <br />After providing us a fascinating history of the Nag Hammadi texts (the &quot;Gnostic Gospels&quot; of the title), Pagels deftly contrasts their tenets against the orthodox positions, revealing the diversity of early Christian thought. The very concepts of &quot;orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;heterodoxy&quot; inevitably have serious secular implications, but these are rarely explored with the adroitness demonstrated by this fascinating work. The Gnostic gospels from the Nag Hammadi differ radically from organized Christian dogma. In the first 300 years of Christianity, Gnostic dogma and scripture were destroyed by zealots and suppressed by the church. The Nag Hammadi is the only surviving scriptures of early Christians that haven't been heavily edited by biased early Christian theologians. They are all free to be read on the internet at [...]<br />Consider:  The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on.

This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />So if the few examples I've given you of some 10 thousand I'm aware in various scriptures, how do you know the Passion or KJV is accurate? Flawed men produce flawed works. No man with emotions and feelings was ever unbiased in his writings and translations. Research the genre of historical books written by scholars who are not blinded by the dogma of their Christian or Jewish writings.  The more I study, the more Agnostic I become.

Others are half-truths, twisted versions of some vaguely scientific fact designed to make you believe the false nutritional information in this book.<br />Read a review written by someone who is actually qualified - a Registered Dietitian, or RD, which is a title that is protected by law so that only those who meet all of the qualifications and education requirements can call themselves that....>They both are written by RD's - in other words, people with a real, valid educational background in nutrition, who are qualified to give nutritional advice.<br />Harvey Diamond, on the other hand, possesses a \\"PhD\\" from an unaccredited school that was formed by a high school dropout who believed that viruses do not exist. The school has since been forbidden from using the word \\"College\\" in its name and from granting academic credits or degrees.<br />PLEASE, before you believe ridiculous claims such as those made by Harvey Diamond, do some research!

Her previous &quot;self&quot;, including most recent ones, is always generic with no last name. <BR>4) With the exception of one or two efforts to elicit facts that could verify Catherine's recollections, Dr. Weiss, repeatedly proclaimed in the book as a brillian scientist, makes no effort to gather facts that could verify Catherine's ravings.  For exmple, what was Eric's last name???  He was a German pilot during WWII, certainly we could trace his existence.  Was this perhaps a deliberate failure on Dr. Weiss' part?	2004-03-14

The best parts are how Bob Brewer amalgamated knowledge of the Bible, Scottish Rite freemasonry symbols, topographical maps and lore passed along by his Arkansas ancestors to decipher strange codes left on trees and rocks. Then he adapts the same code-breaking system along with Jesse James stories to crack strange maps and signs in Oklahoma and Arizona. Well, it's a good read but the proof is in the digging up of treasure. Since many of the treasure sites are said to be on federal land and Brewer consistently refuses to dig without every &quot;i&quot; dotted and &quot;t&quot; crossed, his deciphering lacks physical proof that can be verified. After reading this book, you'll scoff at the &quot;Lost Dutchman Mine&quot; folklore about Spaniards and vengeful Apaches.	2004-03-14

(250 miles in 5 consecutive days, running against fresh Arabs each day!)Since the year 2000, a Spanish Mustang Stallion, by the name of Geronimo's Warrior, set an unprecedented record in the history of the AERC.

So in Lieu of all of the above, Mr. Hopkins is not the one who is lying! It is the O'Reillys. Frank Hopkins championed the legendary Endurance of the Spanish mustangs and his claim stands TRUE even today! Anybody who sinks so low, as to &quot;Edit&quot; a book to serve their own purpose, is to be condemned!

Instead, in order to financially succeed, one must have a system where there is a strong level of cash flow that surpasses his or her level of expenses. The next step is the reduction of expenses. But since we all know that the reduction of expenses is limited by our actual fixed expenses (mortgage, rent, car payments, phone bills) then the focus must be on establishing a system where our level of cash flow is always positive and is always increasing to the point where it enables us to be able to rely on it for our financial well being. This is the same concept clearly proven and verified in other classics such as the Millionaire Mind and the Millionaire Brain. These two books also demonstrate that in order to achieve financial success you need to have a realistic and practical system that will get you there. In Cashflow Quadrant the idea of developing your cash flow with a reliable system that is sustainable is perhaps the most important idea that many investors and entrepreneurs seem to miss while building their financial net worth.	2004-03-09

I bought this book after seeing an interview with Icke on the UK morning TV show 'This Morning'. I found the ideas he was talking about quite foreign to me, but the principle points of his argument, disturbingly at the time, seemed to make sense. It kind of clicked with something in my brain and I just had to investigate further. I've not yet finished this book completely, but so much of what it states makes so much more sense than the drivel we are drip fed by the mass media every day of our 'waking' lives. Icke so completely debunks the American Government and mainstream media's position on 9/11 you wonder as to why you never realised the blindingly obvious before. There are too many problems surrounding the official story of 9/11 for anybody who is interested in the truth to believe it. I wont go in to the problems here, because that is what the book is for, and they have already been mentioned in other reviews. What I dont understand, however, is the idiots who keep whingeing on about how the very mention/portrayal of 9/11 in a different way to the official story is offensive to those people whose relatives/loved ones died in the tragedies. Are you people blind? George Bush election campaign is centred around the atrocities in 9/11!! He's using the terror, confusion and misery caused by the event and the ensuing 'war on terrorism' (what a fat ugly lie that is, made by an even uglier man, by the way) to fuel his campaign for re-election.THAT is 'sick'. The truth is never 'sick'. It may be hard for you to take/accept/come to terms with, but it is NEVER sick, by virtue of the fact that it is the TRUTH. Even if you dont agree with some of Icke's more, well, what may be deemed by others to be 'Outlandish' ideas, the fundamental aspects of 'Problem-reaction-Solution' and the 'Stepping stones' approach are frighteningly real, and they can be seen and verified every day by every one of us. Every point that has been made against this book seems to have come from people who either haven't read it or have missed big chunks of it out because they couldn't wait to get on Amazon and write a review about how offensive/stupid/paranoid it is, satisfying both themselves, and unknown to them, the forces that control them. I do not doubt for a second that David Icke means exactly what he says and that he is extremely passionate about it. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that there is a hidden agenda working away behind the cracked face and gigantic lying mouth of major world power, and the more cracks people like David Icke can make in that face, the better.<br />Maybe one day it will crumble altogether.	2004-03-07

This book is the one that best answered the questions that came to mind after I first began reading the Earth Chronicles. After some independent study I had voiced an opinion online that I was convinced we were descendents of an angelic race, to which someone had queried, You've been reading Sitchin? Who? I asked. I did a web-search and found some critiques of Sitchin's research, read them, and promptly went out and bought 12th Planet . <br />Sitchin's scholarship and translation of the clay tablets provided the background and filled in the holes of my theory of man's origins. Like Sitchin, I too began my quest after pondering over the beginning of the Noah chapter of Genesis that tells of the Sons of gods taking the daughters of man for their wives. Sitchin was way ahead of me, though. <br />All of the Earth Chronicles provided new insights, with plenty of documentation to back up his theories. The Wars of Gods and Men was, to me, the most relevant for opinions to answers I was seeking. I have continued to read every other author I can find that tackles these subjects and have refined my own opinions about them. Zecharia Sitchin remains the vanguard in this quest, and I find his scholarship indispensable. <br />For several years now I have been trying to find holes in his basic premise, only to find slight differences of opinions as regards minor points. Applying his translations of ancient wisdom, I invariably arrive at the most plausible answers to questions that seem to still evade modern scientists. When I read about a new scientific theory it is often laughable when I consider the most plausible answers can be found if only modern science and religion would shake their dogma and realize man has been in possession of those answers for some 6,000 years. After Sitchin, I never feel I am any longer blind. He has assisted me in gaining my sight. If only the rest of the world could see so clearly.<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over.

TEN STARS! ***** *****	This great book on superstring theory is an extraordinary undertaking to make ideas clear to a huge audience, ideas which would be hidden in darkness otherwise though they are of supreme importance for understanding the structure of the world. It's also of supreme importance for scientists to explain the essence of their work to the people in the world around them, everywhere on the planet. I believe that this wonderful book will be enriching for readers interested in sciences all around the globe. <br />It's not necessary to be a magician to foresee that this book will soon become an international bestseller! The great wit of this sophisticated author who is also an important scientist who wants to present a marvellous picture of his field of science provides us with one of the best non-fictional books published in recent years. Let's hope that more books of this kind will follow, because this is obviously the best way for the reader to get scientific information, entertainment, and great graphics all roled into one.<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

This book envites us again to speculate a lot about a 4th or higher dimensions of space, a 2nd or higher dimensions of time, about black holes, (small and) Big Bang(s), eternity ... It's always fun to go with Hawking on a trip outside of our universe, for a moment to be able to watch our world with God's eyes. The illustrations of this book are phantastic, depicting all the difficult mathematical and physical background.<br />After &quot;A brief history of time&quot;, which was written in such an easy way that even non-physicists can understand the pretty tough stuff, it was hard to imagin to write still easier. No wonder, that Hawking could only fail in this try. &quot;The Universe in a Nutshell&quot; is same difficult or same easy, just as one sees it. And, unfortunately, besides the last chapter about special aspects of string theory (brans) it does not contain any new scientific results or theories, that haven't already been mentioned in the first book.<br />However, everything is described so clear and colorful in a new way, it's nothing but a big pleasure to read, and things one has not understood completely at the first time, will be easier to grasp now at the second.<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

You're truly &quot;in on the chase.&quot; Improbable as it seems, Dan Brown has combined nuclear physics and antimatter with Renaissance art, old Rome and the Vatican. You conjure up the images in your mind, but the icing on the cake is Brown's Web site, which shows you the CERN facilities, the plane and then the exquisite artwork of Bernini and others as well as a peek inside the Vatican.

In the Boston area, Jimmy Marcus, Dave Boyle, and Sean Devine are best friends, playing together like preadolescents do everywhere. Their friendship and perhaps childhood ends when eleven-year old Dave enters the car of two strangers claiming to be cops, who sexually molest him. When he escapes and finally returns home he is not the same carefree child.<br />Twenty-five years later, homicide detective Devine investigates the murder of Marcus' nineteen-year-old daughter. His prime suspect is Boyle, whose own wife believes he is more monster than human being. Marcus, an ex-con, conducts his own inquiries because the grieving father plans to provide his own brand of justice to the culprit. These three former friends appear heading towards a bloody deadly collision.<br />Dennis Lehane, known for his Kenzie-Gennero series, has written his best novel to date. MYSTIC RIVER contains a who-done-it, but that is a subplot of the theme that centers on the impact on adults of their broken childhood relationships. This psychological suspense tale works because the three key players and several support members like Boyle's wife appear genuine and consistent so that their actions feel right for them.

First, it is historical fact that many of the founding fathers did not believe in the divinity of Christ. And there is good reason for this, only one of the Gospels (Mark) has Jesus answering the question \\"Are you the Messiah?\\" The other three has Jesus silent, not answering. Many historians believe Paul made most of his stories up (he wasn't there to witness them firsthand) and hence mispoke much of what Jesus said. Paul never met Jesus. The Founding Fathers were mostly pretty smart and educated fellows and knew this; hence they rejected Jesus' divinity but revered his message of love and peace. <br />Unfortunately today's Christian fundamentalists have little use for the love and peace part. Right away Limbaugh's thesis takes a major tumble since he proposes nothing to counteract this view. In typical conservative vein, he states his wrong-headed opinion as fact with no support. <br />Second, the idea that Christians, the by-far dominant religion in the US, is somehow persecuted is patently absurd. Are there some minor political conflicts? Yes, but to call it persecution is downright sensationalistic and absurd. Limbaugh does not know what real persecution is. Try asking Jews, Muslims, Wiccans, Buddhists and others about persecution and discrimination for their beliefs and then you will hear real persecution. Try getting a job with the name \\"Mohammed\\" for example. And one of my favorite Christian fundamentalist fallacies is this notion that one cannot pray in public schools or before a football game. That is completely false. You can pray anytime you want in a public school or before a football game, what you cannot do is have organized prayer. What is particularly ironic is that the same Republicans who rail against teachers who they say can't teach basic math want those same teachers to be entrusted with the awesome responsibility of leading their children in spiritual prayer. Christian fundamentalists need a major reality check because they're not living in thereal world. <br />The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <br />The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the five star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:<br />In Acts 5:30; 10:39. the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, \\"Whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.\\" The word \\"and\\" is not in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction \\"and\\" indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, and then His dead body was hung on a tree. By inserting the word \\"and,\\" numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text. <br />The KJV translators also did not know what the \\"Asherah\\" was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a \\"grove\\" of trees. In I Kings 16:33 they state, \\"And Ahab made a grove,\\" which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an idol here (the Asherah); his sin was idolatry, not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of \\"the horns of unicorns.\\" There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the \\"wild ox\\" and not the mythical \\"unicorn,\\" and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, \\"I give tithes of all that I possess.\\" The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he \\"possessed\\" (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />This book is a must read for idiots, zealots, bigots, sexists, and racists. He who believes blindly sees not the truth.<br />For fun, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

Actual unemployment, counting those who have given up looking for a job and those no longer carried by state databases puts the unemployment rate at closer to 8.7 percent. <br />Manufacturing jobs have declined for 28 months in a row.  &quot;This hardship is concentrated in certain regions and in certain industries,&quot; said Bush during his speech. &quot;You know what I'm talking about here in the Midwest. You're showing signs of recovery here, yet many people here and across this country are still looking for work.&quot; For every job created during the last three years, 1.2 jobs are lost to overseas manufacturing or outsourcing, which the administration seems unable to address.<br />- &quot;It's amazing I won.

If you are a George Bush fan this book is probably not for you. Paul Krugman is currently a columnist for the New York Times but is an economist and has been involved with politics since he worked with committeemen in the Reagan administration. The book was taken from his columns from 2000 to 2003. While he tries to simplify things his primary method of explaining things is through the use of numbers. <br />Krugman explains what happened to the surplus and why the big tax cuts are aimed at ELIMINATING Social Security. Paul Krugman also has some harsh words for his fellow journalists for taking comments from the administration at face value without even doing minimal investigation to check on their validity. If you are a moderate or left in your politics and want to know what happened in the last 3 years this book is for you. If you just want snappy comebacks for your right wing friends then I suggest Al Franken' book instead.<br />After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give tax breaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<br />Economist and Princeton professor Krugman explains why we are back into deficits, why the right-wing GOP refuses to work within the limits of the American political framework, why Americans are now pessimistic about most things, and he exposes George W. Bush for what he is -- A power hungry liar. <BR>But, not only does Krugman point all this out with his great logic and wit, he also (unlike most current political authors) offers ideas on how we can get our great country back on the right track again.<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

Despite the ecclesiastical criticisms leveled against them by so-called Christians, Starbird and Sweeney do an excellent job documenting their assertions in this splendid work of historical reconstruction -- scholarship, I might add, that is supported by several other notable authors and historians. This is not merely some insane theory conjured up by someone with an axe to grind against the Vatican. <br />The authors share several brilliant insights with the reader that are truly inspired and speak to some of those long-unanswerable questions of history. Of course, no one can know the COMPLETE and TRUE story that is the legacy of the Magdalen, but these authors and others like them at least have the courage to make what information they have uncovered available to the masses despite the Church's long history of silence, secrecy, suppression and outright deception. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further.

This work compellingly investigates the relationship between Christian Gnosticism and the nescient orthodoxy in the early centuries of the Christian movement. Pagels explores the political and social implications of the coalescing orthodoxy's religious tenets, providing us something of the secular context for the elements of the Nicene creed. Such an approach could provide (and often has) a facile platform for preachy social discourse or disparagement, but Pagels is too much the scholar for this and I personally found her detachment respectable. <br />After providing us a fascinating history of the Nag Hammadi texts (the &quot;Gnostic Gospels&quot; of the title), Pagels deftly contrasts their tenets against the orthodox positions, revealing the diversity of early Christian thought. The very concepts of &quot;orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;heterodoxy&quot; inevitably have serious secular implications, but these are rarely explored with the adroitness demonstrated by this fascinating work. The Gnostic gospels from the Nag Hammadi differ radically from organized Christian dogma. In the first 300 years of Christianity, Gnostic dogma and scripture were destroyed by zealots and suppressed by the church. The Nag Hammadi is the only surviving scriptures of early Christians that haven't been heavily edited by biased early Christian theologians. They are all free to be read on the internet at [...]<br />Consider:  The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on.

Flawed men produce flawed works. No man with emotions and feelings was ever unbiased in his writings and translations.

In fact, many, many fantasy writers model their work after Tolkien's masterpiece. As far as I'm concerned, Tolkien is a genius. He managed to create a whole nother world complete with new creatures like orcs and hobbits and he totally revolutionized how we think about typical creatures of myth such as elves and dwarves. I mean, who would think that elves could be tall?<br />Heck, Tolkien even came up with a new fully functional language (elvish). You will fall in love with the characters and the book has everything--action, adventure, romance, comedy, drama. I am absolutely FASCINATED by these books and how Tolkien managed to create such an amazing world. I definitely look up to him! I would recommend waiting until you're older than 16 to read the books so you will be able to fully understand them. But I definitely recommend these books to anyone!!

I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's 'Deception Point,; and `Angels and Demons.'

I had an emergency colectomy, to remove tumor, and have grade-c colon cancer.  THis means that there is no visible tumor spread beyond that removed, but > 50% of the removed lymph nodes tested + for cancer cells.  Dr.'s prognosis is 50%-60% 5-year survival.  Chemo is recomended, but will only improve the survival rate by 3-8%. I do know that there will be a small but significant % in my situation will that will survive 30+ years.<br />THis book clearly endorses surgery, chemo, and/or radiation to stop advanced cancer.  THe question is what next?  I have three young children.  Should I do nothing and just hope that I fall on the + side of stats?  Or do I take aggressive action to try and put my self in the positive side? Choose for yourself.  As for me, I will fight with all of my strength to beat this. I am a believer, and my ultimate hope is in God, but he gave me a mind to think, and a strong will to fight and live. TO that end, I ask, can a good detox program followed by a healthy nutritious diet possibly be harmful?  I think not. Is the potential harm from follow-up chemo worth only 3-8% increase in 5-year survival?  I am still praying and thinking about this one.  I may forgo the chemo, but only after many consultations with the oncologist.  I don't dismiss the imortance of the medical establishment, neither did Anne.<br />I find the diet to be a bit too radical, and am reading other books (\\"Juice FOr Life\\") that allow some fish and poultry in the meals, along with more reasonable food mixing, and more cooked foods.  However, the other books seem to align with the this one regarding cleansing and juice recomendations, and emphasis on raw fruits and veggies.  I don't look forward to the juice fast cleansing, but honestly, can it hurt?  Might it help? I see this as a no-lose situation for me.  OThers may have different situation.  But in any case, take control of your desease.  Fight.  Seek the Lord.  Do not surrender hope. <br />To respond to a new review, the problem with a natural approach to fighting cancer is that it can not be verified using the \\"scientific method\\". That is, individual components of the problem/solution can not be verified.  THe problem/solution has to be viewed from a macro perspective.  The suggestion that the American diet is responsible is valid when one looks at cancer rates of Japanese, before and after they adapt the American diet.  However, unless individual food items can be proven to cause cancer, the medical community will not accept the evidence.  The theory, however, is that the total American diet of dead poisened food, is responsible for the failure of the body to fight cancer (specifically due to reduced liver function).  Seeing cancer as a system failure, rather than a local disease is orthoganal to the medical establishemt, and therefore, a program of detox, + disciplined nutrition + specific supliments, while reasonable, will not even get consideration, regardless of its results.<br />I am a cancer patient, not an \\"expert\\".  I am trying to understand my disease, and am not willing to simply hope that my doctors can treat it.  I will insist that they provide compelling data for any recomended procedure.  I will weigh the risks/benefits carefully.  I will also consider reasonable \\"alternatives\\".	2004-02-17

Most of us feel we know the story anyway. \\"Love and Hate in Jamestown\\" by David Price however fills in the familiar outline with some new muscles and sinews.<br />The book principally follows the history of Smith and of the Jamestown colony from the departure of the three ship flotilla from London in 1606 until Smith's death in 1631. This history is of course in large measure one of relations with the Indians. Price, not a historian, has written for both the Wall Street Journal and Investor's Business Daily, so the economic motivations and structure of the colony also are given significant attention.<br />The story is told in a straight-forward style that is largely a strength, but at times makes it seem to be no more than a summary of others' work. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Certainly, it's a well-documented book, with an extensive Bibliography.<br />The book highlights many facets of the Jamestown/Smith story that add to a reader's understanding. I found certain aspects especially effective in this regard. 1) John Smith's background as a commoner, fighter for Dutch independence, self-taught student of military tactics (especially munitions), enlistee in Austrian forces battling the Ottoman Empire, and a captive slave to the Turks. 2) The ease with which the Spanish could have destroyed the colony, changing the whole course of North American history, and the big power politics that led King Philip of Spain to inaction. 3) The evolving expectations of the Virginia Company's managers back in England of what they could expect as return on their investment.<br />At the well-known and crucial point in the story, the author does an effective job of recreating the circumstances of Smith's capture by the Powhatans and Pocahontas' role in his deliverance from certain death.<br />Although strong in presenting these various facets, the book suffers I believe from the lack of a centralizing focus. At many points it seems a biography of Smith, then veers into the dramatic details of the colony's travails after Smith is shipped back to England, then returns to a focus on Smith as he struggles to find an avenue for returning to the New World. Each shift of attention seems abrupt and the level of detail varies uncomfortably.<br />John Smith apparently kept good notes while in Virginia and then wrote extensively about his colonizing experiences. Price of course draws heavily on these narratives and appears to always accept Smith's version of events. This is both natural (Smith had many supporters who verified his accounts) and somewhat unbalanced. The book paints the other colonial leaders - with whom Smith was in unremitting conflict - as incredibly selfish, naïve, and catastrophically unwilling to learn from their mistakes. A more nuanced depiction of those with whom Smith clashed would have added depth to the book.<br />Oddly, while the book does deal with disease among the settlers, there is no such discussion of the role European germs might have played in the decimation of the natives. This is a disconcerting omission. Price also has an amateurish habit of unnecessarily foreshadowing events: \\"shortly he would disclose it\\", \\"before long, he would owe her his life several times over\\", and \\"Smith would not learn of this for a long time to come\\".<br />There are two well-rendered maps, one of the voyage from England through the West Indies and onto the North American coast, and one of the layout of Indian tribes in the large area surrounding Jamestown. A map of the colony and its immediate area would have been helpful, particularly since recent archaeological efforts have added greatly to knowledge of the site. The web site of \\"Jamestown Rediscovery\\" ([...]) provides a useful adjunct while reading Price's book.<br />Some notes on \\"Editorial Method\\" (covering the rendering of dialogue, spelling, place names, dates, etc.) follow the main text. These would have been better placed as an introduction. Readers would be advised to read these notes first.<br />I have no hesitation in an overall recommendation for \\"Love and Hate in Jamestown\\".

It was based on rigorous research which revealed the key strategic decisions that most often determine growth or stagnation in business. They note: \\"Central to our findings are three ideas: the concept of the core business and its boundaries; the idea that every business has a level of full-potential performance that usually exceeds what the company imagines; and the idea that performance-yield loss occurs at many levels, from strategy to leadership to organizational capabilities to execution.\\" In the five chapters which follow, Zook (with Allen) examines \\"the types of strategic business decisions that most often seem to tilt the odds of future success or failure.\\" Zook correctly suggests in this book that many organizations cannot resist the appeal (\\"the siren's song\\") of \\"miracle cures\\" of their problems. Zook focuses entirely on what has been verified in real-world experience, on what is practical, and on what will reliably achieve the desired results of sound strategic decisions.<br />In the first chapter of this book, Zook discusses what he calls \\"the growth crisis\\" which many (most?) organizations encounter. He observes, \\"Finding or maintaining a source of sustained and profitable growth has become the number one concern of most CEOs. And moves that push out the boundaries of their core business into 'adjacencies' are where they are most often look these days.\\" I agree with Zook that these strategies have three distinctive features: \\"First, they are of significant size, or they can lead to a sequence of related adjacency moves that generate substantial growth. Second. they build on., indeed are bolted on, a strong core business. Thus the adjacent area draws from the strength of the core and at the same time may serve to reinforce or defend that core. Third, adjacency strategies are a journey into the unknown, a true extension of the core, a pushing out of the boundaries, a step-up in risk from typical forms of organic growth.\\" Much of the material in this brilliant book is guided and informed by what Zook claims is \\"the new math of profitable growth.\\" Specifics are best provided by Zook himself.<br />Zook presumes that those who read this book already know what a core business is, and more specifically, what the core business is of their respective organizations. Given his objectives, that assumption is probably necessary so that he can explore the opportunities which (key word) appropriate adjencies offer. Fair enough. However, my own experience suggests that companies frequently extend the boundaries of a core business without fully understanding what that core business is. Railroads probably offer the best example. Only much too late (if then) did senior-level executives at major railroads realize that their core business was transporting people and cargo, NOT \\"railroading.\\" Obviously, trains are confined to the tracks as are ships to the water and trucks to the roadways over which they proceed. Early on, what if owners of railroads and their associates had addressed questions such as those Zook poses in his Preface (Page ix)? Had they done so, presumably they would have recognized appropriate adjacencies which include taxi cabs, Super Shuttle, local delivery services, and \\"overnight\\" delivery services (e.g. DHL, FedEx, and UPS). While they're at it, why not own or forge strategic partnerships with over-the-road trucking companies and cargo airlines? Given the central locations of railroad stations in major metropolitan areas, it would have been easy enough to combine a full-range of travel services within an upscale retail mall.<br />The question to ask, therefore, is not what an organization's core business is. Rather, what could AND SHOULD it be? The correct answer to that question is important, of course, because without a proper core, there can be chaos. Also, the correct answer suggests appropriate adjacencies by which to achieve and then sustain increasingly more profitable growth.<br />In the Afterword, Zook imagines himself engaged in what he calls the proverbial \\"elevator\\" conversation during which he reviews the \\"key messages\\" contained within his book. It serves no good purpose to list them here because each must be carefully considered within a meticulously formulated context. However, once the book has been read, I strongly recommend that all of these \\"key messages\\" be reviewed on a monthly (if not weekly) basis. For decision-makers in at least some companies, this may well prove to be the most valuable book they have read in recent years.uggests appropriate adjacencies by which to achieve and then sustain increasingly more profitable growth.<br />In the Afterword, Zook imagines himself engaged in what he calls the proverbial \\"elevator\\" conversation during which he reviews the \\"key messages\\" contained within his book.

Shame on you, Disney Company! <br />The editors who put this together are not the authors of this book -- Hopkins speaks for himself, and believe me, his lies are pathetically obvious.

He fell under the spell of the Gospel of the Free Market in the Thatcherite 1980s, and thus made a transition to conservatism.  When he discovered that Thatcherism/Reaganism wasn't really conservative at all, but rather a dogmatic radicalism, he became an old-school conservative.  He proceeded to reject the Enlightenment tout court, and embraced post-modernist relativism.  Now, he has taken a further step into simple misanthropy.  Gray has written a jeremiad against Christianity, the Enlightenment, science, and any hope of bettering people or the planet we live on.  This is a performative contradiction, of course, because if there is no cause for hope, why write a book?  What's the point?  Fame and money are the only reasons left, one must suppose, and that supposition is perfectly consistent with Gray's line of argument -- all lofty ideals and dreams are illusions.<br /><br /> Despite all that, I enjoyed the book and recommend it.  It's a quick, easy read, quite entertaining, and I'm sure you can find it in the library.  There are many useful citations in the back to more substantial books you might want to read to pursue Gray's points, many made in the form of sound-bite one-liners.  Depending on what you bring to it, you may or may not find it shocking -- STRAW DOGS is mainly based on the growing knowledge from the field variously known as sociobiology or evolutionary psychology or biological anthropology.  Humans are animals, not demigods.  Gray's second main point I think is less appreciated and more important, and that is the evidence that the human species is embarked on a neomalthusian experiment -- overshoot the ecosystem and see what happens.<br /><br /> That's good cause for a jeremiad, and if Gray's disjointed ramblings focus more people's attention on this (\\"death focuses the mind\\") then it is worth something.  Gray is having none of any sort of schemes for improvement, though, let alone salvation.  His presentation is totally negative (we are nothing but \\"exceptionally rapacious primates\\"), which of course is a good strategy for provoking discussion, hostility and sales.  I detect, though, a positive agenda, which Gray only intimates between the lines, and that is the most conservative belief system of all, animism.  If humans dropped their pretense at superiority and stopped all their doomed scheming, accepting their equal status with their fellow animals, and acted with humility and reverence toward their fellow beings, then all might be well.  This seems to be Gray's covert plan for salvation, and it is in fact one I can wholeheartedly endorse.<br /><br /> Gray goes too far in throwing out the Enlightenment.  Rationality does clearly seem to be lacking in most human behavior, but what of it does exist is important to foster, encourage and spread.  (See Daniel Dennett's  [[ASIN:0142003840 FREEDOM EVOLVES]], which makes the same assumptions as Gray, but reaches a very different conclusion.)  Sure it seems like an uphill struggle that we're likely to lose, but I could see that years ago (33 years ago to be precise), and I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't found reasons to try.

Simpson of her day	Rick Geary makes that clear on the back cover of The Borden Tragedy, a straightforward investigation into the infamous double murder in Fall River, Mass., in 1892. While the contents of the book focus strictly on the case, its victims and suspects, the back cover draws various amusing (and convincing) comparisons between Borden in 1892 and Simpson in 1994, from the celebrity surrounding the crime to the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict that closed the trial.<br />Between the covers, however, Geary provides a wonderfully direct account of the incident, drawing on anonymous memoirs from the time they were discovered in a trunk in 1990. While using that typed manuscript as his source, Geary verified his facts with numerous other sources, compiling a fascinating summation to accompany his illustrated narration.<br />The terse account is filled with details that suggest it was written by a close associate of the family. The narrative is written formally, evocative of the time, and Geary's black-and-white illustrations provide a fly-on-the-wall view of events as they unfolded. The book draws no conclusions about the murderer's identity; the killer is always off-panel or shown only in shadow. And, while a small amount of blood is unavoidable in a story of this sort, the book never descends into tasteless levels of gore.	2004-02-08

His work revolves around nineteenth-century affidavits and interviews about Joseph Smith's early life. D. Philastus Hurlbut, an excommunicated Mormon who in 1833 interviewed Smith's former neighbors in upstate New York, obtained several damaging affidavits which described the Smith family as destitute, lazy, and shiftless, as drunkards and scam artists who dug for buried treasure. These affidavits portrayed Joseph Smith as perpetrating the hoax of Mormonism on an innocent world. Published in 1834 in E. D. Howe's \\"Mormonism Unvailed,\\" this view of the Prophet was accepted as truthful by most non-Mormons until the 1960s.<br />Forty-seven years after the Hurlbut affidavits, in 1880, Frederic G. Mather interviewed nine of Smith's early contemporaries. These by-now elderly people confirmed Hurlbut's basically negative opinions of Joseph Smith. Probably in reaction to Mather's work, in 1881 William H. and E. L. Kelley, Reorganized Church apostles, visited Palmyra and also talked with long-time residents. Their work, published in the \\"Saints' Herald,\\" contradicted the Hurlbut/Mather research on almost every score. They reported that the Smiths, though poor, were hard-working, frugal, and upstanding citizens in the community. In 1888 non-Mormon writer Arthur B. Deming interviewed Joseph Smith's contemporaries in Palmyra one last time before their deaths, and his work verified the Hurlbut/Mather research. Deming's \\"Naked Truths About Mormonism\\" proved almost as significant in fueling anti-Mormon fires as had the Hurlbut affidavits fifty-five years earlier.<br />For the next seventy-five years or so, the polemicists on either side chose whichever set of recollections suited their purposes.<br />Anderson spends much of the book in a sophisticated and legitimate review of investigations of Joseph Smith's reputation made by Richard Lloyd Anderson in a 1970 \\"Brigham Young University Studies\\" article called \\"Joseph Smith's New York Reputation Reappraised.\\" The similarities between the authors' names and the titles of their works are all that the two investigators and their approaches have in common. Rodger Anderson also refutes almost every one of Richard Anderson's arguments, concluding that the article fails because of the \\"misrepresentation of his contents and circumstances surrounding the compilation of the affidavits; failure to consider alternative interpretations for the evidence; and invalid conclusions based on faulty premises\\" (p. 28).<br />Motivated by a desire to defend Joseph Smith, according to Rodger Anderson, Richard Anderson put forth several arguments which were incompatible with the evidence. Richard Anderson suggested that Philastus Hurlbut had written the 1833 affidavits himself. Two of the affidavits were each signed by several Palmyra vicinity residents, and Richard Anderson logically concluded that someone must have written the affidavits and then collected the signatures. In the absence of any countervailing evidence, a reasonable assumption was that Hurlbut had done so. From there, it could be argued with some legitimacy that Hurlbut was a heavy contributor to the individual affidavits as well. Richard Anderson based this accusation in part on the similar words and phrases he found in the various affidavits. As a result, he concluded that Hurlbut unduly influenced those he took affidavits from, and that conclusion has been an accepted part of studies of early Mormonism ever since. Rodger Anderson argues, however, that the affidavits may be similar because each person was asked the same set of questions. Even if Hurlbut did write any or all of the affidavits, Rodger Anderson adds, those being interviewed both signed them and swore before witnesses that they represented their positions.<br />Rodger Anderson concludes that there is no reason not to accept as authentic the affidavits collected by Hurlbut and Deming, or that they were anything other than honest appraisals by people well acquainted with Joseph Smith and his family in upstate New York. While Rodger Anderson does inject some useful skepticism into Richard Anderson's defense of Smith, he makes an either/or assessment with no middle ground. Such a conclusion is just as difficult to accept as is Richard Anderson's. Take, for example, the affidavit Hurlbut took of Willard Chase, from my perspective the most interesting of those first published in 1834. Rodger Anderson says that Richard Anderson distorted the account and then rejected it. While I will not dispute that conclusion, Rodger Anderson's final assessment of Chase's affidavit as a reliable statement has other problems. Chase's affidavit does not mention any firsthand observation of treasure-seeking but shows intense interest in a seerstone Chase said he found while digging a well and then lent to Joseph Smith. He tried to get it back on several occasions, even though he said it was only a \\"curiosity.\\" Why would he be so concerned unless the stone had some special significance attached to it? Indeed, Chase said he wanted the seerstone to use it to see \\"what wonders he could discover by looking in it.\\" Other sources demonstrate that Chase was very much involved in money-digging in the Palmyra area, and he was not being entirely truthful when relating information about the suyoct. His account, while probably generally correct, should not be accepted without careful consideration of all particulars.<br />A significant revelation, at least for me, was Rodger Anderson's conclusion that the Kelleys' 1881 investigation had serious problems as legitimate historical evidence. Unlike Hurlbut and Deming, the two Reorganized Church apostles took no depositions and gave their witnesses no opportunity to read and sign what they wrote. They took notes during their interviews and then later wrote their report. Rodger Anderson went through the published account, as well as the notes from which it was prepared (housed in the Reorganized Church's--now Community of Christ--Library-Archives), and found that the Kelleys apparently had fertile imaginations, for there is only a passing relationship between their notes and the published article. The published report, in fact, so upset some of the interviewees that at least three of the ten wrote denials of what it contended. Apparently the Kelleys' zest to defend the prophet outweighed their good judgment in presenting their case.<br />Rodger Anderson has presented an important and challenging study of nineteenth-century efforts to learn about Joseph Smith's early life. His conclusion that the Hurlbut/Mather/Deming research generally reflects the opinions of those interviewed without undue influence from those collecting the material seems relatively sound, although I am less sanguine than the author that some of the details of the Smiths' lives related by those interviewed are entirely truthful. Probably most of those interviewed did consider Joseph Smith to be something of a scoundrel and a charlatan, but whether they reached that conclusion before or after the formation of the Church is a significant question quite beyond the parameters of Anderson's study. His handling of the Kelley research was especially effective and must raise additional questions of historical integrity. A large and useful appendix containing transcripts of all the affidavits and the notes from the Kelley interviews completes the volume. Perhaps this study will spark additional research into this subject; such an accomplishment is as worthy an objective as anyone could ask for.dger Anderson adds, those being interviewed both signed them and swore before witnesses that they represented their positions.<br />Rodger Anderson concludes that there is no reason not to accept as authentic the affidavits collected by Hurlbut and Deming, or that they were anything other than honest appraisals by people well acquainted with Joseph Smith and his family in upstate New York.

Such a conclusion is just as difficult to accept as is Richard Anderson's. Take, for example, the affidavit Hurlbut took of Willard Chase, from my perspective the most interesting of those first published in 1834. Rodger Anderson says that Richard Anderson distorted the account and then rejected it. While I will not dispute that conclusion, Rodger Anderson's final assessment of Chase's affidavit as a reliable statement has other problems. Chase's affidavit does not mention any firsthand observation of treasure-seeking but shows intense interest in a seerstone Chase said he found while digging a well and then lent to Joseph Smith. He tried to get it back on several occasions, even though he said it was only a \\"curiosity.\\" Why would he be so concerned unless the stone had some special significance attached to it? Indeed, Chase said he wanted the seerstone to use it to see \\"what wonders he could discover by looking in it.\\" Other sources demonstrate that Chase was very much involved in money-digging in the Palmyra area, and he was not being entirely truthful when relating information about the suyoct. His account, while probably generally correct, should not be accepted without careful consideration of all particulars.<br />A significant revelation, at least for me, was Rodger Anderson's conclusion that the Kelleys' 1881 investigation had serious problems as legitimate historical evidence. Unlike Hurlbut and Deming, the two Reorganized Church apostles took no depositions and gave their witnesses no opportunity to read and sign what they wrote. They took notes during their interviews and then later wrote their report. Rodger Anderson went through the published account, as well as the notes from which it was prepared (housed in the Reorganized Church's--now Community of Christ--Library-Archives), and found that the Kelleys apparently had fertile imaginations, for there is only a passing relationship between their notes and the published article. The published report, in fact, so upset some of the interviewees that at least three of the ten wrote denials of what it contended. Apparently the Kelleys' zest to defend the prophet outweighed their good judgment in presenting their case.<br />Rodger Anderson has presented an important and challenging study of nineteenth-century efforts to learn about Joseph Smith's early life. His conclusion that the Hurlbut/Mather/Deming research generally reflects the opinions of those interviewed without undue influence from those collecting the material seems relatively sound, although I am less sanguine than the author that some of the details of the Smiths' lives related by those interviewed are entirely truthful. Probably most of those interviewed did consider Joseph Smith to be something of a scoundrel and a charlatan, but whether they reached that conclusion before or after the formation of the Church is a significant question quite beyond the parameters of Anderson's study. His handling of the Kelley research was especially effective and must raise additional questions of historical integrity. A large and useful appendix containing transcripts of all the affidavits and the notes from the Kelley interviews completes the volume. Perhaps this study will spark additional research into this subject; such an accomplishment is as worthy an objective as anyone could ask for.	2004-02-08

This book contains the painfully funny adventures of President Clinton's in-house joke writer.  Mark Katz, the son of an orthodontist, was the kid who cracked jokes from the back row of your seventh grade English class... but it was the Honors English class.  He was the class clown to the elite, not the student body masses.  He learned to self-edit all his jokes and only voice the best ones.  He grew up to write humor speeches for nation's Chief Seventh-Grader, Bill Clinton, as well as a top FOB Hollywood celebrity, Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Albright and others.  Katz's job was to write Clinton's funny responses to the crises of the moment.  Lines that are funnier than \\"I did not have sex with that woman.\\"<br />This book opens like all good business and political biographies.  There is a crisis the author must face.  Once overcome, the book starts at the author's birth and works forward to the opening episode.  In this book, the opening episode is stress-filled but humorously enlightening.  President and Mrs. Clinton are perturbed; Clinton's speech is minutes away, and Katz's jokes are not to the President's liking.  Will Katz buckle under Clinton's pressure or stand up for his jokes?  And will Clinton find something to nosh on as they talk?  When the story continues, we find Katz in his mother's womb. Yes, just as Clinton was influenced by JFK and shook the hand of JFK at the White House, Katz's life was affected by JFK, too.  Katz was nearly prematurely born when his pregnant mother was startled by JFK's assassination in 1963.<br />As a preteen, Katz was supporting McGovern in the way a kid could and rushing home from school to watch the Watergate hearings on PBS.  In high school, his jokes were getting him in trouble with the princiPAL, and in college he was writing a humor column. In his book we learn about the life of a grunt volunteer on the Dukakis campaign, his struggle up the campaign staff ladder, and the back-story of Dukakis' photo-op with the tank.  His stints in advertising in Manhattan and California, and his cross-country road trip are hilarious and bluntly honest.  Some stories are too honest.  How was Katz to know that his first boss would be the best friend of Katz's brother's litigious ex-fianc&eacute;, or that the sweater he borrowed from his brother for work was hers?  As Michael Waldman's book, \\"Podus Speaks,\\" verified, joke writers have strong egos and desires for exposure, in a world where copywriters and speechwriters are supposed to live in anonymity.  Katz deftly balanced between anonymity and exposure most of the time.<br />In mid-book, when Katz joins the emerging Clinton campaign and crashes on the couch of a guy named Stephanopoulos in Little Rock, we learn about the role of humor and the joke writer, the annual DC Winter roasts and dinners known, and gain insights into the machinations of the West Wing, OEOB, and VP's residence.  Katz also lists the jokes that never made it into the recorded speeches.  This is a delightful and necessary read during this primary and convention year.p with the tank.

An absolute must read for anyone interested in this topic, regardless of position on firearms. <br />The world is full of myths and misquoted information. All too often you hear made up statistics over this issue - on both sides. This book takes a scholarly look at the issue using open information and sources that can be verified and indepently analyzed to verify the results - something usually sorely missing from all discussions on this topic. This does however make it a pretty dry read - if you are looking for the grandstanding theatrics usually associated with both sides of gun control, look elsewhere. <br />If you are for the free ownership of firearms, it provides you with solid information and statistics to back your position. If you are against firearms ownership, and have a rational and reasoning mind, this book will give you some great food for thought, if you don't throw it away and you actually do read it. I have suggested and given this book to a few people with strong feelings about this topic, and they usually just ignore this book's information, as it is so much easier to just blindly charge on with nothing more than emotionally based sound bites as a substitute for reason and thought.	2004-02-06

Having said that clearly, it seems to me a most valuable book.  Part of the reason the book is dry reading is simply that it is factual.  Unlike many books, line after line of this text give explicit facts that can be verified or falsified by further reading.  Factual information can be less pleasant, easy reading than a digested or even \\"sexed up\\" editorial.  So, what I am calling \\"dry as dust\\" can also be seen as elegantly factual---just what we need.<br />The context explained in all detail in this book shows quite precisely the relationship of Wahhabist Islam in Saudi Arabia to the government.  The relationship is unlike what we experience in the West, and a lot of explanation seems needed.  We see here, then, extremely good evidence that \\"Arab extremism\\" is identical with Wahhabism; that it is being exported in a consciously hostile way by the Saudis; and that it is as dangerous to most Muslims as it is to most Christians or Jews.<br />Although this is very important information, it seems not to be entering as it should into policy making in the West.  That needs to be changed.  Perhaps at the next election, we might need a regime change (non-violent, thank you), too.	2004-02-03

It is a well-written compilation that will entertain and warm the hearts of readers.  Whether you are a believer in fate or think that random happenings are merely a simple set of circumstances, this book will capture your interest and give you plenty of food for thought.<br />We have all heard a story or two about someone being in the right place (or wrong place) at a specific time that resulted in circumstances that altered a life forever.  Do you believe that we get a &quot;nudge&quot; to go in a certain direction?  If you do, you will love this book.  If you don't, I can guarantee that you will be a believer of fate by the time you are done reading.  The stories are written in a short, easy to read style.  There are stories from different generations, during different wars, tales of people narrowly escaping death, and stories about the course of a life being changed by a split second decision.  There is a narrative account of a man that escaped the horror of 9/11.  There are stories about birth and death.  Those are just a few of the descriptive, anecdotal pieces you will find in this book.  The co-editors, to be truthful and accurate, have verified each story.<br />I found it to be very interesting and had a hard time putting this one down.  The stories stay with you long after you turn the last page.  There is such an assortment of incidents that people have recorded that it is almost impossible to deny that there is a force at work that is much bigger than we can see.  I would highly recommend this book for readers that are easily touched by the human spirit and all the oddities that happen which cannot be explained.	2004-02-02

During that time I have experienced bull and bear markets as being generally puzzling and unpredictable, and have ridden the market up and down with the masses, which are generally advised to dollar cost average and buy and hold.  I was particularly incensed, as was everyone else, during the recent severe bear market, when the \\"diversified group of mutual funds\\" failed miserably as all the ships sank, and the mutual fund managers were seemingly baffled and confused, unprepared to exercise any sell discipline, and totally ineffective in protecting our money.  Leslie Masonson has presented a relatively simple and understandable, statistically verified and workable means of formulating a personal approach to market timing, by using one or more logical and tested strategies to attempt to optimize the rallies during bull markets, while endeavoring to sidestep bear markets while the herd heads for the door.  Plaudits to Mr. Masonson for offering a plan which admits to no guarantees, but which incorporates the hard earned and heartfelt experience of a lifetime of investment counseling, and is designed to help us plan our investing so as to be able to make our own decisions more rationally and effectively, without relying on any outside parties. This point is particularly important, since I'm sure that most investors would agree that no one else is nearly as concerned about our portfolios as we are.	2004-02-01

This causes it to be much less like a textbook than many others on the same subject.  Therefore reading this book cover to cover is relatively easy and useful.  Examples given are at the appropriate level of complexity - neither too simple nor too complex.<br />Readers of this book could easily range from senior management to test coders.  Senior management would learn the purposes behind various aspects of functional verification and why the cost and complexity continues to rise.  Engineers would be exposed to the reasoning behind the use of some functional verification techniques.<br />Each chapter discusses the ideas behind some aspects of functional verification with examples of how this might be used in an actual system being verified.  There are few code examples since that would not contribute to the purpose of the book.  The examples are primarily system architectures and how a specific component of functional verification would be used in testing that architecture.<br />The list of subjects covered is complete relative to the current state of the art.<br />Overall this is a very useful book to read.  I would suggest that most verification engineers and their managers would benefit from exposure to this book.  Even if you know all of this already it is a good book to have available to explain to other people what you are doing.	2004-01-29

Half-way and Sort-of	This book does a reasonable job to overview Reich's life and most of his early work, though it fails to be as thorough as for example Sharaf's \\"[[ASIN:0306805758 Fury On Earth: A Biography Of Wilhelm Reich]]\\". The author gives his impressions of Reich's work, a philosopher's discourse and comparative review of Reich's behavioral findings as they relate to modern ideas in psychiatry and psychology... and on that matter he does a reasonable job. However, what bothered me was the terrible misrepresentation of Reich's biophysical research. Corrington either does not know about, or knows but for some reason fails to discuss, the multitude of controlled studies undertaken both during Reich's lifetime and after his death, which have verified the more controversial aspects of his biological and orgone energy discoveries. So, for example, the reader will learn nothing about: 1) DeMeo's 1970s [[ASIN:096218554X University of Kansas replication of Reich's cloudbuster research]], showing positive results , nor DeMeo's global cross-cultural study \\"[[ASIN:0962185558 Saharasia]]\\" which used standard anthropological evidence to prove the global accuracy of Reich's sex-economic findings on the origins of violence. 2) The double-blind and controlled studies of S. Mueschenich and R. Gebauer at the University of Marburg in the early 1980s, \\"The Psycho-Physiological Effects of the Reich Orgone Accumulator\\", verifying exactly Reich's original findings on the human physiological response to the orgone accumulator. Also not mentioned, the additional replication study of the orgone accumulator by G. Hebenstreit at the University of Vienna. (both of these are fully cited in DeMeo's [[ASIN:0980231639 Orgone Accumulator Handbook]] 3) The large number of replication studies on the orgone accumulator's effects upon plants and cancer mice by Richard Blasband, Courtney Baker, Robert Dew and others as published in many articles in the Journal of Orgonomy, Annals of the Institute for Orgonomic Science, Pulse of the Planet and (German) Emotion journals, from c.1965 up into the present. 4) Replication studies on Reich's bions, as made by biologists from R. duTeil in France, who presented his results to the French Academy of Science in 1938, to B. Grad in Canada to Dew, Blasband, and a whole list of others who made replications of Reich's biogenesis and bion experiments -- none are mentioned except in a single passing footnote (p.280, n.10) The recent issue of Pulse of the Planet (subtitled \\"[[ASIN:0980231655 Heretic's Notebook]]\\") shows color photos of protocells and bionous forms well on the path to life made from completely sterile and previously \\"dead\\" preparations, following or building upon Reich's original protocols, by Grad, Snyder and DeMeo, equal to anything published by NASA in the nature of contemporary \\"origins of life\\" research. 5) Also not mentioned, clinical studies from German physicians, where \\"Orgone Accumulator Therapy\\" has shown dramatic help to cancer patients and against other immune-system disorders (for example see \\"[[ASIN:3799902716 Heilen mit Orgonenergie]]\\"). Unlike the USA, where the FDA uses policemen and the courts to assure a pharmaceutical MD/hospital monopoly, in Germany the orgone accumulator has a legal status similar to acupuncture and homeopathy, as an accepted form of \\"energetic medicine\\" which is even recommended to the EU by the German government for harmonization of medical practices. And so on. Corrington is an academic, sympathetic to Reich, and so he should have dug into and explicitly reported on these matters. He also apparently got the ear of Roger Straus, head of Farrar, Straus and Giroux publishers, who is intimate with the Wilhelm Reich Museum and also claims to be sympathetic to Reich -- so both the author and editor are in the \\"Reich circles\\" sufficiently to know about these studies, or at least to have been asking some questions. Why are the \\"friends of Reich\\" so systematically oblivious to these facts, or unwilling to mention them in new books such as this one? I know for a fact, that Straus was approached to publish other books which gave these facts on Reich's biophysical work, but those books were politely refused.  Why?  Why is it that those who are interested in Reich's therapeutic work, often denigrate and ignore his biophysical work.  A half-dozen emails by author Corrington to senior researchers following up on Reich's work over the years would have provided him with an abundant list of such replication studies -- the orgonelab.org website has an entire lengthy \\"Bibliography on Orgonomy\\" online and available to anyone, with an entire separate list of citations to Reich's work and the many replication studies. Nearly none of it is mentioned in the Corrington book, save for the materials on Reich's early work. This is a glaring omission, a \\"condemning with faint praise\\" of his later biogenesis, cancer and orgone energy discoveries, and it stands out like a sore thumb.  This book will help the dishonest \\"skeptics\\" to once again sit comfortably with their long-time disinformation and outright lies about Reich, which were responsible for his death in prison, for the burning of his books, and for the contemporary academic distortions and black-out on his important discoveries.  The book will be a frustrating and upsetting read for those who know the facts.	2004-01-27

Using this \\"billiard ball\\" model of the universe to support its own interpretation of predestination and the sovereignty of God, this alliance of faith and reason could also give credence to a \\"scientific\\" (read:  intellectually respectable) study of Holy Scripture with doctrines abstracted from evidence in the Bible just as scientists derived their laws from evidence in the \\"book of nature\\".<br />Despite some initial success, this view faced a nearly complete dissolution following the introduction of scientific theories on evolutionary development, random processes, and the impossibility of experimental objectivity.  This new trend, beginning with the earth sciences (geology and biology) and then spreading to the physical sciences (relativity, quantum theory and \\"big bang\\" cosmology), made science appear more an opponent than an ally of the faith and seemingly left the American Protestant consensus bereft of its intellectual justification.<br />Despite this gloomy turn of events, some folks are not quite ready to give up the ghost.  R. C. Sproul, a prolific writer, skilled speaker, and respected teacher is well established as a defender of the American strain of the Reformed tradition.  Perceiving a philosophical threat to the faith in the idea of randomness, he faces it head on in Not a Chance.  Never shy about voicing his opinion, Sproul forcefully argues the completely incompatibility of a belief in randomness with a belief in God.  \\"If chance is\\", Sproul bluntly asserts, \\"God is not.\\"  Well...not quite.  It is not the God of the universe who is rendered impossible but the god of Sproul's tidy theology.  The God who created the universe is alive and well.<br />Sproul begins his diatribe with a \\"straw man\\" attack upon the use of chance as an active causal agent in the natural world - a position no scientific theory upholds.  In clumsily imposing his own definition of chance, Sproul fails to differentiate the clearly distinctive meanings of the term prevalent in different disciplines.  For example, mutations in DNA replication are often referred to as \\"by chance\\" in evolutionary theories but none ever really suggest chance as a causal agent.  Breakdowns in the replication process occur (as in any physical process) from many causes and there is no way to predict them.  Thus it is called a \\"random mutation.\\"  On the other hand, quantum theory uses a definition of randomness that is purely mathematical.  Although the behavior of systems may be predicted with great accuracy, with individual subatomic particles there is no deterministic causality.  In neither case does one cite chance as an active agent.<br />Even worse, Sproul frequently cites as \\"evidence\\" against the theories of noted scientists various off the cuff remarks never intended as precise scientific or philosophical statements.  For example, in his critique of Danish physicist Neils Bohr, he ignores Bohr's extensive scientific work in quantum theory (verified in experiments and the basis of everything from cell phones to nuclear warheads) and concentrates instead on \\"one liners\\" that Bohr - known for the occasional hyperbole - uttered for their \\"shock value.\\"  Given Sproul's lack of scientific training, the reason for building a case upon such irrelevant anecdotes is quite evident:  Unable to refute Bohr on the basis of the actual science itself, Sproul can only counter the perceived threat to his theological presuppositions by scouring popular science books for witty quips to subject to ridicule.<br />When Sproul attempts to discus actual scientific work, his poor grasp of the subject at both a scientific and a philosophical level becomes painfully obvious.  Considering how many Christians frequently (and rightly) criticize scientists for unfairly dismissing the claims of Christianity without ever giving a fair hearing, it is disheartening to see Sproul exhibit similar tendencies in passing judgment on sophisticated topics without the knowledge to do so intelligently.<br />Further evidence Sproul is not up to the task is his use of Albert Einstein as an ally for his cause.  While Einstein was certainly a critic of the of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, his outlook was far removed from Sproul's outmoded ontology.  Einstein's work superseded notions of absolute time and space within objective frames of reference - all necessary for the causal relationships Sproul seeks to defend.

US	36390655	R262YPPORYAB83	067972110X	260477978	Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason	Books	2	41	103	N	N	Revising Foucaultian Revisionism	Immensely popular and influential among left-wing American cultural critics, this book has been critiqued ravishly by French psychologists.  The gist of their critique is that the book represents more of the values and concerns of Foucault rather than an accurate and responsible history of mental illness.  Foucault's central argument that society defines sane and insane behavior is an old cliche in cultural anthropology.  Furthermore, recent advances in cognitive science and psychiatry challenge Foucault's position by affirming that mental illness is exactly that, namely, \\"an illness.\\"  Simply stated, there is so much cross-cultural evidence that certain psychiatric disorders are univeral and not, therefore, specific to cultures but biologically grounded.  Various mental illnesses have been verified biologically as illnesses in the same way that biologically illnesses are also recognizable as physical illnesses.  Foucault is sometimes touted as a \\"cutting-edge\\" thinker, but his ideas were dated before he wrote them down.  Erving Goffman's book \\"Asylums\\" is an earlier and far better treatment of the cultural dynamics of mental institutions, and Ruth Benedict argued (in 1930) that insanity is often a cultural construct rather than a physical malady.  The basics of Foucault's ideas can also be seen in the writing of Shakespeare, Cervantes, Montaigne, and other Renaissance writers--about 400 years ago.  The moral dimensions of Foucault's fraud are only now being explored, and this writer's currently trendy reputation is not likely to stand the test of time.  This book is a good example of ways in which trendy writing and intellectual fads can quickly be discovered to be mere cliches.  Intellectual dubiousness aside, the major problems with this tome deal with Foucault's romanticization of mental illness.	2004-01-19

I was not disappointed.<br />I can't recall a better examination of the topic of prayer, and exactly what it is and how to practice it. The approach is not the convential fuzzy and pious one, for as the author states, there ought to be another word that we can use for prayer, since misuse has given it such a negative connotation.<br />What is prayer? It is stated that it is a yearning of the heart arising from either suffering or love. Whenever we think strongly about a subject we are \\"praying.\\" The process spelled out is Thought, Intention, and Surrender.<br />The book examines prayer across history and across cultures. She even brings in the findings of modern science (including the fact that our concentrated thoughts in the present appear to be able to reach back and influence the past....)<br />Perhaps the most valuable portion of the book deals with how NOT to pray. This can be summed up as: 1) no lip-service prayers (if you don't really MEAN what you are saying, or not concentrating on the meaning), 2) no show-off prayers (prayers to impress or shame others), 3) no harmful prayers (no calling down vengeance or harm on others), and 4) no prayers of worry or doubt (prayer should be positive- and in perfect faith.) I know that I have verified all of these principles in my own life over the years.<br />As a youth I used to think that prayer was a waste of time. Now I know that it is probably the most meaningful of human activities- all else is secondary to seeking connection to the Divine, however fleeting.	2004-01-18

It really helps!<br />The author had covered most of the topics that should be included in a compleat guide of trading (trading psychology, uaage of TA, money management, trading system development....). Some of his key points are:-<br />1. Top traders are essentially pro gamblers who only bet when the odds are in their favor.<br />2. Trading must be dealt focusedly as an entrepreneurial business with loss (must be relatively smaller than profit) taken emotionlessly as regular business cost.<br />3. Good money management is the common denominator of all successful traders irrespective of their style.<br />4. TA is bascially a trend/fact finding process to be searched through multiple time frames, verified with different indicators, and that TA can be applied on indicators as well (trendline in MACD, and CD between price and MACD)<br />I personally like the no nonsense and humorous writing of the author much. The summary and point form \\"do's and dont's\\" in the end of every chapter did help me to memorise what I had studied for long. His clever use of graphs in the TA tools section is really outstanding. Believe me or not, his use of less than 10 pages on the explanation of MACD is a lot more powerful than many TA books that used up over 100 pages on this single topic.<br />In short, it's a must read for any player who wants to improve his/her edge over the ocean of competitors in the market. My salute to the author who writes me this excellent book.	2004-01-17

Or only spin?	What stuns me with all the one-star reviews is the fact that they so clearly haven't read the book.  This book isn't about Paul O'Neill:  it is about the blind dedication of people inside the Bush White House to policies that are determined by politics and not by data and information.  O'Neill emerges as someone who carefully sifts information, takes a naturally conservative approach to issues, and does not like to recommend any policy that is based on speculation or insufficient evidence.<br />The book shows that a number of White House insiders or heads of government institutions (notably Alan Greenspan at the Fed) are not very comfortable with the ideologues currently running the White House.  Lost in a lot of the attention that O'Neill is getting is the fact that other White House folk have also spoken off record.  Reading the book--and I generally find it is easier to talk about something you have actually read instead of something you merely make up in your head--it is pretty certain that Alan Greenspan was also interviewed for the book and is one of those who spoke off the record.  I would also bet that Christine Todd Whitman, former head of the EPA (another one who wanted policy to be based on verified data), was another.  It is absolutely definite that either Colin Powell or several members of the State Department (unquestionably with his blessing) cooperated in the making of the book.  Possibly other nonideologues like Condileeza Rice or one of her aides talked with Suskind.  <br />The mistake that many are making is assuming that O'Neill is merely doing this out of revenge.  It is almost impossible to support that theory after reading the book.  <br />I think the is one of the most important books that has been published in the past two years on any subject.  The Bush White House has largely been an impenetrable bastion.  Now we have a vivid picture of the inner workings of the White House as presented by multiple insiders, most speaking off the record because they are still working for Bush.  But O'Neill and the massive amount of documentation he provided for Suskind has performed a huge public service.  I don't think anyone should consider voting for George W. Bush in 2004 unless they have read this book first.	2004-01-15

I mean quick.  Really. Not much rigor (physical or mathematical) is to be found in this book.  As I read the book, I kept having the feeling that the mathematical derivations are laid out to lead to the results desired, and if there have to be a dozen assumptions and approximations or skips in steps made to achieve the goal, then so be it.  As for the justifications for those assumptions, why, they help you get to the desired results.  For your amusement, I will point out one of such sneaky skips.  Look first at Eq 8-1-17.  If you don't like to take things for granted, you have verified this expression to your satisfaction.    You are happy with it.  Now fast forward to 8-7-3.  Look at how there is a degeneracy factor in the Rabi frequency.  Can you verify it?<br />As I've said, if you want rigor, this book will disappoint you.  Unfortunately, it appears that just about every book in optoelectronics is written rather loosely in this sense.  So you are really stuck with this one, more or less.	2004-01-12

There is a danger, however, in believing that this book paves a sure-fire path to success.<br />People with poor self-esteem or psychiatric problems (the latter which Robbins thinks are generally the product of running defective mental programs) will find a way to fail within the framework set by Robbins.  Competent therapy, the kind that Robbins labels as inefficient, would be much more appropriate for people in this category.  Also, I believe that in order to get where you're going, you have to start from where you are, not from where you think you should be.  Robbins's approach, although excellent for some, pretty much presupposes we all start at the same place.<br />Additionally, despite Robbins's great success coaching various high-profile people, some of what he says is flat-out wrong, particularly as it relates to diet.  In his &quot;Energy: The Fuel of Excellence&quot; chapter, Robbins states that the body converts foods into energy in the following order: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.  (This is to support his low-protein diet theory.)  A first-year course in biology informs us that the body actually uses proteins before fats.  This portion was obviously not proofread by someone with a scientific background... and the this raises the question of how factually sound the rest of Tony's advice is.  Also, Robbins's declaration that 30 grams of protein are quite sufficient for an adult is suspect, to say the least.  Use personal experience and observation to decide for yourself whether good health can be maintained on such a low protein intake.  Even most vegans try to get more than that.  Remember, Robbins produces, by his own account, an abnormal amount of human growth hormone, so the &quot;laboratory&quot; of hisbody will likely not resemble yours.  Similarly, the concept of food combining is based upon a limited understanding of how the digestive system works.<br />(An article in the Feb. 2004 issue of Discover Magazine contains an article entitled &quot;What Does Science Say You Should Eat&quot; that provides dietary advice based on the most comprehensive scientific study ever undertaken, overseen by Harvard's Walter Willet.  This would be a better source for health information.)<br />Much of Tony's theories, although presented via complex explanations, just seem kind of bogus in actual practice.  On the other hand, many others are unique, helpful insights that can easily be verified by common sense.  And again, maybe something that brings no results whatsoever for me may be helpful to the right person.<br />If you're particularly drawn to this book, I'd recommend you buy a copy and read it with a critical mind.  To anyone else I might suggest you talk with someone who's familiar with Robbins's work and see if it's right for you before buying.  I genuinely like Tony Robbins and believe he is sincere.  Still, I think a &quot;buyer beware&quot; approach to his teachings is certainly justified.	2004-01-12

I like this volume because I enjoy the \\"As I Please\\" columns very much. Too bad that they no longer publish the book in a hardbound edition. <br />Since the purchaser of this volume is likely to be familiar with Orwell to some degree, I won't preach to the choir. I can't remember anything I disliked. A few details about the book, there is an index, you'll find a mix of Orwell's letters, essays on diverse topics, and As I Please weekly columns during the war years. An excerpt from that column illustrates Orwell's sobering humor (I hope the copyright people don't get me):<br />\\"When Sir Walter Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower of London, he occupied himself with writing a history of the world. He hand finished the first volume and was at work on the second when there was a scuffle between some workmen beneath the window of his cell, and one of the men was killed. In spite of diligent enquiries, and in spite of the fact that he had actually seen the thing happen, Sir Walter was never able to discover what the quarrel was about: whereupon, so it is said - and if the story is not true it certainly ought to be - he burned what he had written and abandoned his project.\\" Now, Orwell shares this anecdote because he wants to make the point that \\"even as late as the last war (WWI) it was possible\\" to ascertain some degree of truth about what's going on in the world, for instance, casualty figures, because sources could be verified by cross-referencing. Orwell complains/observes, however, that in WWII \\"a Nazi and a non-Nazi version of the present war would have no resemblance to one another, and which of them finally gets into the history books will be decided not by evidential methods but on the battlefield.\\"<br />You see the journalist and perennially honest (and somewhat bitter) truth-seeker here?	2004-01-10

This is a lively journalistic account of the career of Harrison Storms, president of the Aerospace Division of North American Aviation that built the Apollo capsule. Because of the Apollo 1 fire that killed three astronauts in January 1967, Storms and North American Aviation, Inc., got sucked into a controversy over accountability and responsibility. In the aftermath Storms was removed from responsibility for the project. The most important aspect of this book is its discussion of the Apollo fire and responsibility for it from the perspective of industry.

Not Urinium bomb at all. This can be easily double checked or verified by simply asking a high school student!<br />I think the book is rushed out to cash in on the author's fame on DVC book, and it indeed showed us how sloppy the process is.	2004-01-07

Would it be like Dorothy's ruby slippers or Midas' golden touch?  Another question- how is the Grail's authenticity verified?  Tell me this, Dan Brown!  No, &lt;The DaVinci Code&gt; never reveals this to my satisfaction.  The whole 'thing' hinges on a riddle and the hero, Langdon never sees the Grail.  So...it's DaVinci Code as in Crossword Puzzle, not as in the chromosonal genetic code that spells Jesus Christ.  Admittedly, a clever read and if &lt;DaVinci Code&gt; serves you like it did me, to generate an invite to brunch, go for it.  Another caveat; this is one of those stories where the hero was tired to begin with and stays up 48 hours.

But with a careful layout of the truth as it shows up in American Communist and Moscow newspapers, citing of interviews of actors who felt that they were \\"duped\\" by the Communists to paint HUAC and the US government in general as evil and disregarding craftsmens' rights Lloyd Billingsley creates a credible argument that we do not know the whole story.  Perhaps most troublingly, Billingsley systematically cites evidence of American Communists in Hollywood marching strictly to a tune from Moscow, not their own masses:  galvinizing the Anti-Fascist (eg Anti-Nazi) effort whole heartedly....until the day Stalin signed the anti-agression pact with Hitler.  Suddenly, Pete Seger was singing peace-at-any-cost songs instead of string-the-fuehrer-up songs; Lillian Hellman was silenced when she had been so vocal about our duty to protect what she was heard to call \\"the motherland\\".  Then, when Hitler invaded Hellman's precious \\"Motherland\\", Hollywood elite's communists' tune changed again, as evidenced by The Daily Worker and New Masses....a Communist paper popular in Hollywood.  Could there be better evidence that CPUSA was the marionette in Stalin's paws?<br />  And what a prize for him!  Being able to use Hollywood as his vessel for agit-prop must have made Goebbels a little jealous, talented as Lenni Riehfenstahl was.  Aside from the fact that socialist rhetoric often runs amok in 30's and 40's films --- capitalists bad, poor people good----Billingsley lists at least 3 unapologetically pro-Soviet films made during the war, ostensibly to boost understanding of our ally, but laced with untruth.<br />  The book is not just a review of the early years of the House Un-American Committee ( another myth dispelled: this was pre-McCarthy, who came onto the committee long after the Hollywood 10 were dispersed for refusing to simply admit they were in the Communist Party....which of course, was not a crime.) It is a survey, through earlier interviews, articles from The Daily Worker and New Masses, and material available for a brief period after the collapse of the Soviet Union that verified the ties between the Soviet and American parties and the US party's dependence on \\"Moscow gold\\", which of course made it hard for them to disobey \\"Moscow's demands\\".  Explanations are given for seemingly popular leaders stepping down suddenly; for Pulitzer Prize winner Walter Santy lying about the Ukranien famine (he was being blackmailed); for people recanting when they wrote articles stating perhaps we shouldn't worry about making sure so much Marxist dialectic gets into our films (other Hollywood elites would lock them in a house and basically \\"debrief\\" them until they came to the \\"right\\" conclusion....or,until they simply stormed out and said \\"this is b.s.\\").<br />It is also about learning of \\"ambassadors\\" like Paul Robeson, who betrayed Jewish friends when for the hundredth time he travelled to the USSR and when told they were to be murdered, came back here & assured us that Russia was purely pro-Semitic.  (His friends were murdered soon after; Robeson, in an anguished memoir, recanted his mistake years later).<br />In brief, this is a book that gives us a sight of very normal people in fancy clothes; union leaders, communist bosses, congressional committee members, actors and actresses, with heroism and weaknesses on all sides.  Billingsley's seemingly \\"revisionist\\" telling is well cited in thourough end notes that I've enjoyed following up on in the texts mentioned, especially those drawing from the briefly-opened KGB archives.: this was pre-McCarthy, who came onto the committee long after the Hollywood 10 were dispersed for refusing to simply admit they were in the Communist Party....which of course, was not a crime.)

It denouces as public enemies, all who question its methods or throw light upon its crimes.\\"    To her and her benefactors who say all who question them are \\"UnAmerican\\", I submit that this statement is in direct opposition to the founders' intent.  I had never heard of this author until this book was a gift from my first-born, who, exhausted from long commutes, work and law school, must have been dangerously duped by Hate Talk Radio. Oh, dear.  Coulter's distortions of the McCarthy era (I was alive then, and later knew personally many Hollywood personalities who were wrongfully fired due to his paranoia), were mind boggling. As the daughter of a Republican leader, my Father and I watched the \\"hearings\\" on TV as one would watch a \\"cop show\\": not ever, ever, taking this attention-starved man seriously.  Of course there were subversives in government, but ethical people's lives were ruined by his fantasies and half-truths. Not I, but my Father, Chief Liaison Officer for General MacArther, worked with and had great respect for General George Marshall, who was the opposite of the snobby, rich boy image created by Ms. Coulter. Unlike the way she (and her handlers) simplify reality, General Marshall's assignments were constructive, painful, difficult and complicated.  A black and white world brings the benefit of  undisturbed leisure.What fertile ground for the ego!  Reading this, I am certain these nuts are having a heap of fun.  The book contains the old formula: creating crises, (other than our real ones),  enemies, (other than those genuinely out to get us), appeal to the lowest reptilian instincts. Without the reader's awareness, the contents must comfort his conscience for releasing all that nasty caveman panic/hatred, and reinforce that he/she, as goody-two-shoes Yes Man/Woman, is \\"overcoming evil, is flying above the clouds, is with it.\\"  Hogwash!   I cannot respect this young woman as I should, until she reveals from whence she came, who her parents were, and who, and this is a big one,  financed and did the writing of this book.  I highly recommend it for broadening one's vision of what is Out There.  Richard Mellon Scaife, who needed a raison d'etre after Tbe Cold War went pffft, began financing Clinton-hatred, using innuendo laced with cash. This time is said to be when, (via Paula Jones), Coulter went Big Time. Scaife has been named as one of her angels.  I have no sworn/verified documentation and Scaife's modus operendus is shadowy, The inheritance from his Mom, now reputed to have grown to a billion, is not.  There I go, trying to write like Ann Coulter, (except for the boring confession of not being Omnipotent.) I feel sorry for women of ambition who are unaware that they are being used. Yet, her arrogant attitude seems to be \\"Forgive me for I know not what I do, but please don't tell me.\\" Other reviewers say she is pulling in bags of money.  How does she spend it?  For barbed-wire pretzels?     PS    Jesus is a Liberal. This gal appears to me like \\"a motherless child, a long way from home\\".  She desperately needs a dictionary, some pragmatic history books, a Mother and perhaps a cold beer.	2003-12-31
US	49916018	R53YJ45PSFBQZ	0060955449	2759931	Profiles in Courage (Perennial Classics)	Books	4	191	207	N	N	Grace Under Pressure	\\"Profiles in Courage\\" is a rare book - for a number of reasons.<br /><br />First, of course, is that the author is nothing short of American royalty and the publication of the book in 1956 had an instantaneous impact on Kennedy's political fortunes.  In the late 1950s, JFK was a freshman senator without many notable achievements.  \\"Profiles\\" immediately set him apart from his Congressional colleagues and established him as something of an intellectual heavyweight in Washington and garnered valuable publicity that ultimately vaulted him to the 1960 Democratic nomination and the presidency.<br /><br />Second, never before has a work of non-fiction been so immediately embroiled in controversy, both because of questions concerning its composition and the fact that it won the 1957 Pulitzer Prize for biography.  The consensus today -- nearly half-a-century after its publication and after intense scrutiny -- is that the book was essentially written by committee.  JFK may have provided the inspiration for the work, but close aide and confidant Ted Sorensen did most of the heavy lifting around research and writing.  In other words, Kennedy was more the \\"editor\\" than the \\"author.\\"  Indeed, Herbert Parmet investigated the \\"who wrote Profiles?\\" question in detail in his 1980 book \\"Jack: The Struggle of John F. Kennedy\\" and concluded that there was no evidence from reams of hand-written notes and memos that JFK contributed anything substantial to the final version of the book.  This after Kennedy threatened to sue ABC for millions after syndicated columnist Drew Pearson alleged that the book was ghostwritten during a 1957 appearance on the Mike Wallace Show, an allegation ABC was forced to retract.  To add to the brouhaha, the Pulitzer committee never officially nominated \\"Profiles\\" in 1957, yet somehow it came away with the award.  Rumors swirled that Joseph Kennedy - and good friend and New York Times columnist Arthur Krock - leaned on the committee to get JFK the award, but those charges have never been, nor likely ever will be, verified.<br /><br />Finally, the book is rare and important because of its content and theme.  Contrary to other reviews, this book is NOT about \\"doing the right thing.\\"  The author(s) stress that each vignette concerns Senators who deliberately took a stand of conscience, which they knew would be unpopular with their constituents and likely cripple their political careers.  Their stories have nothing to do with being right in time.  Indeed, was Webster \\"doing the right thing\\" when he pursued compromise in 1850, including acceptance of the hated Fugitive Slave Law, which so appalled abolitionist Massachusetts?  Was Norris right for scuttling Wilson's attempts to arm the American merchant fleet that was being decimated by German U-Boats before the US entry into the First World War?  The central issue is the willingness to accept malicious public abuse, the loss of friends, power, prestige and the sacrifice of future aspirations on an issue of moral conscience, regardless how posterity judges that particular position.  Kennedy et.al. demonstrate the admirable virtue of political courage through a collection of historical anecdotes of senators - some legends (Webster) and others forgotten (Ross) - across the expanse of US history.<br /><br />The profiles are all crisp, lively and engaging (kudos to Sorensen!).  Each is inspiring in its own way without resorting to mawkishness sentimentality.  However, one should be cautioned from fully embracing each story in its entirety.  For instance, the author(s) credit Kansas Senator Edmund G. Ross with single-handedly casting the vote that acquitted Andrew Johnson from impeachment charges in 1868, thus saving the executive from gross encroachment by the legislative branch.  Some noted historians of the era, such as Eric Foner, note that there were a number of acquittal votes waiting in the wings to ensure that Johnson was not thrown out of office and that Ross ultimately received a number of patronage posts from the president in return for his vote, therefore undermining the notion in \\"Profiles\\" that Ross' actions was purely selfless and in the interest of the nation.<br /><br />In sum, \\"Profiles in Courage\\" is a highly readable collection of anecdotes from Senatorial history with a positive, inspiring theme - regardless who wrote the book.osts from the president in return for his vote, therefore undermining the notion in \\"Profiles\\" that Ross' actions was purely selfless and in the interest of the nation.    In sum, \\"Profiles in Courage\\" is a highly readable collection of anecdotes from Senatorial history with a positive, inspiring theme - regardless who wrote the book.	2003-12-30

To start off with, my back ground is 10 years ex Naval aviation and the term \\"Flyboy\\" is not a flattering term I would use to describe me or any of my comrades and the author uses this term through out the entire book as if it were an honorary title or rank to be used in front of each veterans name. The book is written at a grade school level as if it were attempting to give a quick history lesson leading up to WWII and takes almost the first 3rd of the book to get to the real story, which leads me up to my biggest complaint about this book. The author uses obscure incidents and wars as well as unverified single sources to paint a picture of America as an evil imperial power that went around killing innocent people (In the Philippines) as the rule instead of the exception and the last time I checked my history books many thousands of American lives were lost \\"liberating\\" the Philippines in the fall of 1944 as well as hundreds more in Iraq to this day so I take offense to his twisting of history. The author sucked me in with the fancy book cover and catchy title into thinking I was about to learn more about some of the missing pieces of the vast puzzle that is WWII but instead was subjected (granted I could have stopped reading) to a liberal political correct story of how these American veterans deserved their fates because of past American actions. For people interested in learning about past American veterans try the \\"Medal Of Honor\\" book by Peter Collier and you will defiantly walk away feeling much more inspired with the human spirit. I feel the best books about veterans are generally those written by veterans and this author should think of a possible new career as a fiction writer and leave the history telling to others. Anybody want to buy my book?&lt;smile&gt;	2003-12-30

Make no mistake, reading \\"Genesis 1948 - the First Arab-Israeli\\" is no small undertaking. The book's 830 pages (without the preface) consist of some 793 pages with the text and accompanying maps while the remaining pages consist of extensive notes, a bibliography of more than 500 sources and a large and comprehensive index. The book is simply put, an epic of modern history and I highly recommend it as such.<br />The story is told in one of the best ways possible... from the vantage points of the participants. Much like the much-acclaimed best seller \\"O Jerusalem\\" by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, Dan Kurzman. The author of  \\"Genesis 1948,\\" conducted extensive research into the history of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence consulting over 500 books, newspapers, periodicals, pamphlets, diaries and documents (written in a number of languages including French, English, Arabic and Hebrew) in addition to conducting a large number of interviews with participants from every side in the war (Egyptians, British, Israelis, Transjordanians, Americans, UN personnel, etc.). He ranged from the Arab League Library in Cairo to Government Press Department Library in Tel Aviv. He took all that information and cobbled it together into a dramatic human-interest story full of facts and referenced detail.<br />Some have called the work biased and &quot;home team&quot; coverage, but I strongly disagree since you can look up any of the author's facts and read them for yourself. Having said that, I do feel that the author had more sympathy for the Israeli side, but it's also clear that he had considerable sympathy for the poor Arab farmers (fellaheen) forced to fight a war in Israel in which most didn't believe. I have been reading the history of the modern Middle East for many years (from both the perspective of the Arabs and the Israelis) and I don't feel that the author left out significant details of the history especially considering the work was originally written in 1970 before the climactic 1973 Yom Kippur War. Contrary to other reviews, Kurzman has no problem talking about Jewish terrorism during the pre-1948 period and also heavily criticizes the Israeli side throughout the book. On a likewise note, Kurzman was lucky to make contacts and conduct research in the Arab world before the 1973 Yom Kippur War after which the Arab world largely closed up foreign access to Arab libraries, media sources and interview possibilities.  <br />------------------------<br />Dan Kurzman wrote the following of his book (on page xi of the preface):<br />\\"I have checked every fact to the extent possible, and discarded any questionable information that could not be verified. In the case of conflicting and irreconcilable accounts of events, I generally present them with all of their sources. Quotations and reflections are taken from diaries, memoirs, and other documentary material or from personal interviews. I rarely use dialogue, the accuracy of which has not been confirmed by at least two of the participants in the exchange. Thus the language is as authentic as any that might be used in an autobiography of the person quoted\\"<br />\\"Using the techniques of the novelist and biographer, I have tried to bring the history alive. To a large degree, history, is the story of people; and this book describes their role in one of the most poignant and important stories of our time.\\"<br />------------------------<br />What really makes the book work is its' honest and endearing first-person perspectives of the participants of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence. It's hard to not to find some admiration and respect for people like Abdullah Tel of Transjordan, Sayed Taha of Egypt, the enigmatic David Ben Gurion of Israel, or even Gammal Nasser, future dictator of Egypt. Their stories are told making full use of their own biographies, diaries and such. Lesser-known figures also have their stories told and it was the stories of some of these \\"minor players\\" that really endeared \\"Genesis 1948\\" to me.<br /> I highly recommend this extensively referenced history of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-12-28

Also, he takes a very pragmatic approach towards what's actually possible in different corporate climates. Rather than only telling you what right thing to do is, he helps you decide what the appropriate thing is.<br />The explanation of the relationship between risk and benefit analysis was both insightful and seemed like it would be useful. It provides a pragmatic framework for a lot of what are considered 'good engineering practices', such as incremental deliverables that can be measured and verified in meaningful ways.<br />The only downside is that it's very difficult to understand how to take advantage of some of the frameworks he provides without being in a management position already.

However, Coulter goes to the original sources rather than the filtered information we see in text books. We learn that Joseph McCarthy was cautious when he named names in the State Department, not the destructive person he's made out to be by liberals.  He didn't ruin any innocent lives.  The only people's lives ruined by McCarthy were true Communists that were spies for the Soviets or were sympathetic to Stalin who killed 10 million people.  People sympathetic to a killer of that magnitude should be blacklisted, don't you think? Also, we learn that Franklin Roosevelt knew that there were Communists from the Soviet Union in the State Department but didn't care causing the U.S. to be in great danger.  This is verified through the Vienna Cables.  This book is is as timeless as ever causing the reader to think about the war on terror.  The liberals are citing with the enemies as they did during the Cold War.  20 years from now we will see that Bush did the right thing in fighting terror as Reagan did with fighting the Communists.	2003-12-22

He treats each argument fairly and reasonably. As one reviewer pointed out \\"Where he is skeptical he is judging scientists by their own standard: the evidence\\"<br />In my view he is at his strongest when critiquing Bio-Psychiatry and especially the pseudo- science Evolutionary Psychology, which he rightly points out its inability to perform experiments, and the impossibility of objectively determining what is a cultural or innate trait. He likens this budding \\"Science\\" to the now fading psychoanalysis, which has interesting views on human nature, but whose theories can never really be verified.<br />Finally, he tackles the old philosophical problem of consciousness, and highlights all the competing contradictory views on how to tackle the problem.<br />Of course ultimately we may solve the problems that Horgan thinks are beyond our grasp, but until then, Horgan's Critical rationalism will do just fine.	2003-12-22

If GOD were to drop down and reveal personally the identity of Jack the Ripper to our multitudes, it's quite doubtful even then that any sort of contentment would overtake the bleating throngs of Ripper-chasers.  In any case, a few points:<br />For one, \\"circumstantial evidence\\" does not carry the flimsy, pejorative connotation within the justice system that it does among the general population.  As other reviewers have pointed out, very strong legal cases can be made (and are, routinely) on the basis of \\"circumstantial evidence.\\"  In fact, the circumstantial can be considered stronger even than some types of direct evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, which have been much studied and found to be notoriously unreliable.  As an astute reader will notice, Cornwell is smartly careful to qualify, quite meticulously, the recorded statements of eyewitnesses.  <br />And even such things as fingerprints and DNA can fall into the realm of the circumstantial--if, for instance, a suspect's presence is verified by prints but time-frame is critical and cannot be ascertained.  Additionally, circumstantial evidence in the form of, for example, the \\"ha ha's\\" in various Ripper letters is actually quite significant stuff.  The fact that, in the cultural and historical context of Cornwell's focus, the expression was an American linguistic convention but not a British one is just the sort of \\"circumstantial\\" oddity that should solicit serious investigative attention.  <br />And Cornwell's tentativeness--her \\"maybes\\" \\"perhapses\\" and \\"possiblys\\" that are curling the nose hairs of so many of her detractors here--are actually the requisite marks of a judicious investigator.  As Cornwell herself points out to the reader, even forensic experts discussing DNA results make a deliberate practice of doing so only in terms of probabilities, even when the experts themselves consider the results conclusive or damning.  This is convention, and it's fullynecessary and appropriate.  Anyone trotting among the educated while spouting brazen absolutes is inviting a precious beating, and Cornwell is plenty smart enough to know this.  Incidentally, even the phrase \\"case closed\\" does not out of necessity imply an absolute.  Cases all over are routinely closed by all sorts of investigators and legal types, for all sorts of reasons, including the gathering of evidence that is convincing EVEN WHILE IMPERFECT.  Hey, present-day Scotland Yard is impressed with Cornwell's analysis.  Not too shabby.  <br />The weakest part of Cornwell's otherwise compelling argument is her very Freudian explanation for Sickert's murderous exploits (i.e. the potentially deformed and butchered penis).  Rather than venturing into that ever-suspect, murky territory, she could have skipped over the issue of motivation entirely.  Most people sufficiently knowledgeable about psychopathy, as Cornwell clearly is--and I am referring here to psychopathy in the clinical, DSM IV sense of the term (as opposed to the popular, oft-misguided Hollywood rendition)--understand that, ultimately, motivation for the abhorrent behavior of psychopaths is rather beside the point.  Their compulsive, obsessive, destructive penchants are inborn and do not necessarily correlate with any external factor or event.  Some psychopaths have experienced violent, abusive childhoods, but many have not.  Some engage in violent behavior, and some do not.  Cornwell provides a particularly good description of psychopathic characteristics in general.  And current research into the brain function of psychopaths is, in fact, beginning to reveal distinct organic neurological abnormalities that probably have a genetic basis.  In other words, it's looking more and more to be the case that psychopaths are not made by bad parents, but that, in fact, they are born.<br />But as non-psychopathic people, the rest of us nearly always want to have clear, plausible antecedents--explanations--for horrific things to which we simply cannot relate.  And this is why, one could readily suppose, Cornwell cannot really be faulted for feeling compelled to provide an identifiable motive.  We don't want to believe that someone like Walter Sickert was simply born without the neurological foundation for a conscience, an unpreventable and incomprehensible deficit that led him to mutilate people for no other reason than that his talented-but-nevertheless-damaged brain was chemically stimulated and gratified by his acts.  Admittedly, one could read every last scrap of text depicting the psychopathic nature and--lacking personal, face-to-face experience with one of these inscrutable beasts--still fail profoundly to \\"appreciate\\" what psychopathy actually is: evil without a sponsor.  Really, it most likely runs no deeper than the entropic, frenetic looping of electricity among faulty neural pathways.  This is huge, and it holds dire implications--for both the legal system in particular and for society in general.  In a very fundamental and real way, psychopaths are not human.    <br />And the structure of the text, clearly problematic for many readers (though not this one), seems--more than anything else--a complex side-effect of the need to wrangle and weave multiple, \\"swim-lane\\" chronologies into a single stretch of fabric.  No mean feat, and Cornwell pulls it off laudably.  The alleged \\"tangential\\" and \\"boring\\" excursions are interesting at worst and necessary at best.  We are, after all, concerning ourselves with intricate events dated over a century ago.  And far more remarkable than the evidence missing from Cornwell's study is the amount that was still available!  With all of the various documents providing rare insight into Walter Sickert's character and whereabouts--and there are a lot! (all duly cited in the back of the text)--the presiding fact that none has yet to render Cornwell's suppositions implausible is far more impressive than critics would have us believe.  And,finally, as to the charges that Cornwell demonstrates some incriminating bias by announcing her suspect-of-choice in the beginning of her book: well, duh.  Her thesis is that Walter Sickert committed the long-unsolved atrocities.  She then proceeds to tell us why she thinks this.  This approach is fully customary.  <br />_Portrait of a Killer_ is an exhaustively researched effort and is overwhelmingly deserving of attention.  A smart, solidly respected author has staked her very reputation on it, and she has not appeared to do so foolishly.  Time to give up the ghost, me thinks.	2003-12-17

US	29585751	ROU2STIWP2D4X	1879181835	116193802	The Lost Book of Enki: Memoirs and Prophecies of an Extraterrestrial God	Books	1	38	60	N	N	An Unfortunate Fiction	Though I often disagree with his interpretations, I have long been a stalwart fan of Sitchin, and reference his works often. However, this book, presented as if there were archaeological texts to back it up, is an out an out farce.<br />Throughout his previous works, Sitchin has always taken the position that the Anunnaki represented the \\"only\\" god system ever known on Earth, a concept that is plainly in error from a Christian point of view. I have steadfastly referenced the archeological texts concerning Alalu, Kumarbi/Zu, and Ullikummi and have found that there is absolutely no archeological evidence what so ever to indicate these beings were ever involved in the Anunnaki gold mining operation. There is, however, very sound archeological evidence in the Sumerian king's list, known to scholars as W-B/144, indicating Alalu and his descendents established Earth's first city, Eridu, prior to the Anunnaki rebellion led by Anu. In Christian terms, it is Anu, Enki and Enlil who represent the leaders of the \\"fallen angels\\".  The evidence also indicates that Alalu had human children on Earth. It was Alalu's descendants, called \\"lulu's,\\" who were the subject of Enki's rather insidious attempt to genetically manipulate mankind into slavery.<br />Furthermore, any attempt by Sitchin to connect Alalu's home world with Mars, shows a very clear lack of scholarship on his part. In Sitchin's third book, &quot;The Wars of Gods and Men&quot;, (p.92) we find that Enki/Ea offers to take Kumarbi to the planet, \\"MAR.GID.DA,\\" in order to consult with \\"Lama\\", who is the matriarchal ancestor of both Kumarbi and Anu. Anyone with access to a search engine can type in the word, MAR.GID.DA, and learn that it is a direct reference to the Big Dipper, not Mars. In antiquity, the Big Dipper was known as both the \\"Chariot of Heaven\\" and the \\"Plough of Heaven\\". One might conclude, therefore, that the Old Testament statements that, \\"They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,\\" suggests that the Big Dipper and Alalu's descendants may ultimately play a very important role in the history of Earth. This conclusion is again backed up in the New Testament with the parable, \\"No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is worthy of the kingdom of God.\\" Once again, Alalu's probable association with Christianity is clearly referenced in The Book of Revelations, chapter 19, where the word \\"Allelula\\", (pronounced A.LA.LU.YA) appears four times.<br />I dare say, these easily verifiable facts are certainly enough to make anyone question Sitchin's interpretations, and most certainly should give any Christian considerable meat to ponder. The Egyptian myth concerning the beginning, Genesis one, is called \\"Sep Tepi.\\" (See \\"Gods of Eden\\" by Andrew Collins or reference \\"Edfu Texts\\" online.) Collins makes a very good case for connecting Kumarbi and Alalu to \\"the first time\\", where they fight a tremendous battle with \\"serpent\\" deities called Aa and Wa, who undoubtedly were Ea and Ra. Kumarbi and Alalu lose the battle, and paradise sinks beneath the sea, and is called \\"the Island of the Trampling.\\" The landmass rises again, only now there are new \\"gods\\" running the show, one of whom is called \\"The Lord, mighty-chested, who made slaughter, the Soul who lives on blood.\\" These being then give birth to eight other gods, called \\"Shebtiu\\", which are called \\"the Ogdoad\\" in the Theban myths. The Ogdoad/Shebtiu then give birth to nine other gods, which correspond to the Egyptian Ennead, and eventually this race of Anunnaki gods, gives rise to the Horace Kings, the \\"Re-heraky\\" (Ra hierarchy) associated with the Egyptian sphinx, and the \\"royal blood\\" of the lion kings of both the Egyptian and Hebrew races. <br />It might also be wise of Sitchin fans to realize that his earlier ascertains that the Biblical numeral \\"666\\" is a reference to Ba'al, is clearly disputed by a great number very renown archeologists, Sir Wallace Budge being perhaps the most famous among them. (See \\"Amulets and Talismans\\", Budge) Throughout antiquity, the superstitious and war-torn people of the Middle East regularly wore amulets and charms to ward off evil spirits or bring them luck. They regularly inscribed their charms with \\"magic squares\\", a numerical system that Thoth, the serpent's other son, presumably taught the Levite priesthood. Even the common-folk knew what magic squares were, because they used them in their appeals to various Anunnaki deities. In essence, magic squares are blocks of numbers that produce the same sum whether they are added in horizontal rows, columns or diagonals. There were seven very well known magic squares, each corresponding to the following heavenly bodies, or \\"gods in our solar system; Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the moon, and the sun. The numerals for the magic square of the sun added up to 666, and it is evident that the number is a reference to Ra/Marduk's \\"Solar Deity Complex.\\" <br />In Egypt's oldest Theban creation myths, the Egyptian's credited the \\"god of the beginning\\" with the name \\"Amen\\", which is verified again by the apostle John, in Revelations 3:14. This deity, though recognized and honored by Thebes's earliest priesthood, was considered an unknown and \\"hidden\\" god; a god whose existence went so far back in time, the Theban priests knew very little about him. Up until the Tower of Babylon incident, which more than likely happened in centuries immediately preceding the year 2000 BC, \\"the Amen\\" was practically an unknown god in Egypt. The \\"confusion of tongues\\" very likely corresponds to the confusion in Egypt's history during this same time frame. John the Divine seems to suggest that Ra/Marduk committed the first known act of \\"identity theft\\" by adding the name \\"Amen\\" as a prefix to the name \\"Ra.\\" The Christian records indicate Ra is a liar.<br />Though Sitchin's scholarship has certainly opened our eyes, the conclusions he presents are very questionable, particularly to anyone who actually makes the effort to reference his work. Let's put it this way... The words, \\"A.LA.LU.YA  A.MEN! LAMB.MA MAR.GID.DA!\\" would clearly tell a different story than Sitchin does.	2003-12-14

If you cannot figure out why sometimes everything just clicks into place and why sometimes roadblocks show up at every turn AND you are willing to accept responsibility for the way your fears, prejudices, hopes, beliefs, experiences and dreams control the flow of your life, then this is the book for you.  This book shows you how to assimilate key principles of self-awareness, self-love, trust, acceptance, gratitude, and responsiblity in very practical ways. If the exercises are done correctly they begin a very intense, honest, and ongoing self-examination of everything you hold dear or fear in this life.  If you are ready to take the risk of coming face to face with who you truly are as a person, then buy this book.  The benefit is that you become much surer of who you are, clearer on what you want from life and more directed on how you need to accomplish it. This book rates as one of the most valuable books I've ever purchased.<br /><br />March 1, 2011:  I am re-reading this book as I have done periodically over the years. I just noticed something today on page 24 that I just wanted to note.  There is a partial quote at the bottom of page 24 (softcover) that reads \\"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.' This quote in the book is incorrectly attributed to Nelson Mandela but is in fact a quote from US author Marianne Williamson. The full quote can be found in Marianne Williamson's book \\"A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course in Miracles (1992)\\". This small error aside (which can be verified on WikiQuotes) I still rate this book as one of the most valuable I have ever purchased.	2003-12-10

Aside from the fact he was excommunicated for Arian sympathies shortly before Nicea and had some explaining away to do later on, his work is alright and because of him many philosophers and thinkers who otherwise would have been lost to time, as well as some letters, and of them we now know something. <br />Eusebius was a very bookish man, had a gigantic vocabulary; some of his words are the author's guess since they are to be found no where in even the largest of Greek lexicons, hid away in his study very often, and for the most part didn't spend much time with his flock. Right away he assumes everything he writes will be correct and brings along with him a number of legends such as the legend of Christ and Abgar the kind of Edessa. He even copies down the letter written by Christ to Abgar which is a strong testimony to how gullible he really is. His beginning introduction in which he expounds on the eternal Word of God, as I recall (it has been two years since I read it) smacks of slight Arianism. He is even known to have composed a creed at Nicea which would have united the Arians and Orthodox-Catholics because of its ambiguity and beating around the bush but was thrown out by the Orthodox (pun intended) for just that very reason; it avoided the real issues. <br />At one point in the work, as the Williams notes, Eusebius transposes the years and months of episcople reigns so 5 years and 11 months came out to be 11 years and 5 months. <br />On the other hand, he tells many excellent stories and passes onto us many important martyrologies which I found highly edifying. His writting is very comprehensive, aside from having many historical errors, most of which are in minor facts, so comprehensive in fact, that neither Socrates and Sozomen tried to rewrite what he did, such is the acknowledged superiority of his text. <br />I would recommend it for others to read in a second and without a doubt as long as that person knows something of Church history Eusebius, and how he tends to just repeat information without much thought (he was great at repeating information but in all honesty, he wasn't much of a thinker). Still, though, it is extremely valubable and in the areas where it can be verified by other writings of the the times he is in or mentions (which is the vast majority of it) it is an exact reflection of the Orthodox Church of all times and ages. Just beware, Arius and Eusebius had a pre-Nicea (325) writting correspondence in which Arius treats him like a confidante and friend and Eusebius is sympathetic to him. I don't think Eusebius really actually knew what the differences were which Arius innovated and was condemned for.	2003-12-10

I did not even mind the slightly warped logic that Talbot's theory is based on, and which goes something like this: paranormal event X could be explained IF (and only IF) the universe is a holographic one.  The weird thing now is that he presents material as if he was drawing conclusions from the evidence - e.g. he claims that things (like pieces of glass/ashes) could materialize out of thin air -and at times used to.<br />This brings someone with a sceptical mind (which shouldn't be illegal) to ask himself a serious question: what if there is neither a holographic universe NOR a paranormal event (those pieces of glass, for example, being the evidence)? What then? A more objective approach would be to draw the conclusion from the evidence, not build the evidence around a foreordained conclusion (or the other way around? I'm confused...).<br />But he presents \\"evidence\\" not only in form of annecdotial reports which can be impossbily verified by the reader (did glass materialize?), but also beefs things up with personal experiences that must be taken at face-value. The stories become more and more unbelievable (to the sceptic mind) towards the end of the book. Regardless of the fact that in order to believe in any of this one would have to make up ones mind in what to believe first (holographic universe vs. the specific paranormal events described in this book), this work is a tantalizing read that has caused me to get interested in quantum mechanics, which would have been a laughable idea two months ago....And: I especially agree with the author as he states that the \\"Big Bang\\"-theory and theory of relativity by Einstein have never been verified (this being impossible) but are nevertheless accepted to be facts or truths by the scientific community, leave alone the public. Therefore, it should be possible to think in all sorts of directions as one pleases, without being discriminated against by anyone for not delivering the ultimate proof.And certain things certainly should be subjected to more research. I just don't believe in glass materializing, as I know I mentioned before.	2003-12-07

I have never been to China nor do I plan to go, but have a strange curiosity about their culture.  I am an Amy Tan fan and although her books are fiction, much of what I thought was just fiction was verified in reading this book.  During the last 15 years my hasband did extensive business travel in China.  He would relate many bizarre incidents to me and I never really appreciated his frustration in dealing with the Chinese until reading this book, which, by the way, he gave to me as a gift.  I always had so many questions.  These questions were addressed and I feel I have a much greater understanding of the Chinese and their work ethic, strange though it might be.  I cannot for the life of me understand why any American company would want to set up an operation in the PRC when the situations described in this book are known by any businessman who tries to negotiate with these people.  This book should be required reading for any company that is contemplating doing business in the PRC.

US	53016962	R1234SLBYISDNW	0684849739	431236317	The Bible Code	Books	3	58	70	N	N	Interesting but not very convincing	I had been meaning to read this controversial book for some time now, but only recently did I pick The Bible Code up to see just what all the brouhaha was really about.  This is certainly an interesting subject, but I was a little disappointed in the theory, arguments, and proofs presented here.  As the book progressed, the open mind I began the book with started to shrink, as Drosnin began to backpedal and hurt his own case.  I don't doubt the author's faith in the method and results of his work, but this book falls way short of convincing me that the Bible Code exists and, if so, that its existence is even meaningful.  The book has a number of weaknesses.  First of all, Drosnin is a former reporter working outside of his trained field; The Bible Code is supposedly built on a sophisticated mathematical model, and its interpretation requires significant knowledge of the Hebrew language in its original form - the original language of the first five books of the Bible.  He presents us with printout after printout of data, but all I can do is stare at the Hebrew letters; the actual scientific paper that first delved into this mathematical issue is included in an appendix, but the math is way over my head.  Drosnin says other mathematicians have verified that the model is correct, but I just have to take his word for it.  I simply don't have any significant data upon which to form an opinion yea or nay about the Bible code.  Drosnin may actually have done better to include no illustrations whatsoever; what I see are foreign letters marked in areas all over a given page; it's like a find-a-word puzzle, only the letters of your words don't even have to be connected directly.  Odds of given terms \\"crossing\\" one another on one page are given, but I still don't know how these odds were determined.  Drosnin also indicates that the same model was run against two other long books and showed no kind of code whatsoever, but two books alone seems to be a small sample set, and I have no idea how many attempted searches were done in these limited sample sets.<br />The \\"evidence\\" sounds pretty good at first.  Drosnin constantly repeats the fact that the Bible Code predicted the assassination of Israel's Prime Minister Rabin, the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy into Jupiter, the start of the first Gulf War, etc., all to the very day.  Tell me more, you think to yourself.  This is where Drosnin starts to slip, however.  He spends most of his time talking about Armageddon, specifically how Jerusalem will be destroyed by a nuclear bomb.  He was certainly right in naming terrorist acquisition of weapons of mass destruction to be the greatest threat to the modern world, but prophesying trouble in the Middle East doesn't exactly require a Karnak.  He predicts that then-Prime Minister Netanyahu will be assassinated and that Israel will be attacked in 1996.  This book was published in 1997, completed after 1996 came and went.  Suddenly we find Drosnin discovering that the word \\"delayed\\" just so happens to turn up alongside all of those dire predictions of his.  He actually expresses the opinion that a delay in Netanyahu's visit to Jordan prevented the Armageddon he had predicted.  The Bible Code, he now decides, must include eventualities, things that may come to pass, things that we can prevent from coming to pass.  This back pedaling hurts his credibility quite a bit in my eyes.<br />In summary, I can't argue the mathematical validity of The Bible Code in any way, shape, or form, but Drosnin's arguments fail to convince me that he is right about this subject.  He can barely find anything in his code until that \\"thing\\" has already happened, and it seems to me that finding a few related words after the fact on a sheet full of letters is no difficult feat.  I do know that there is one definite error in the book, as Drosnin (and the Bible Code) shows that FDR declared war on Japan on December 7, 1941, when war was not declared until the following day, December 8.  As for the predictions he did make about the future, he doesn't exactly go out on a limb.  There will be strife in the Middle East and a series of earthquakes in Japan.  These things happen every year, so these are hardly convincing prophetic tests of his code.  I can't say The Bible Code does not exist the way Drosnin says it does, but it will take a whole lot more evidence to ever convince me of such a fact.day, December 8.

In the previous novel, the Dom Pedro IV's crew have followed clues left by Oskar DeSilvo to Glister.  There they fly the Cruzeiro do Sul down into a launch dome within a huge bullseye designed to attract their attention and find DeSilvo awaiting their arrival.<br />In the complex on Glister, DeSilvo explains his actions and shows the simulations that he has developed to test the contraction theories of Ulan Baskaw.  He is mortified that the information discovered by Admiral Koffield seems to be confirmed by these simulations and subsequent events.  He has realized that he needs external verification of his thinking and thus has lured them there.  At this point, Yuri Sparten attacks DeSilvo and both are injured.<br />In this novel, Koffield and the crew of the Dom Pedro IV have verified DeSilvo's simulations using their own data.  Now they are waiting for DeSilvo to explain his scheme for avoiding the contraction, but first he is waiting for his FTL data taps to relay the results of the Ignition of the NovaSpot over Greenhouse in the Lodestar system.  Back in that system, Planetary Executive Neshobe Kalzant of Solace is also waiting for these results, watching the countdown to Ignition from the control room in the Lodestar VII.<br />On Mars, Kalani Temblar of the Chronologic Patrol is surveying the damage done to the Dark Museum, following the footsteps of Oskar DeSilvo and Admiral Koffield.  When she is through recording the evidence, she wires explosives to the armored door of the tunnel and sets the timer.  Then she returns to her lander and, despite the damage done by the omnipresent mold, takes off for orbit.  In Mariner City, the explosives detonate, causing sympathetic detonation of the booby-trap demolition charges, resulting in the collapse of the entire length of DeSilvo's tunnel into the Dark Museum.<br />In this story, the rationale behind DeSilvo's later behavior becomes exceedingly and frighteningly clear.  Koffield and his associates agree to help DeSilvo, but first Sparten has to sneak off to check out a diehard settlement about 700 kilometers to the south.  During his flyby, the aircar comes under fire from the diehards.  <br />The importance of the NovaSpot to make Greenhouse a waystation for the evacuation of Solace becomes clear to Elber Malloon and he becomes a player in system politics, first as an agent of Captain Sotales of the SCO Station Security Force and later as a liaison between the lowdowners and the uppers.  His actions facilitate the evacuation of the lowdowners to Greenhouse, which in turn relieves pressures on Solace planetary resources and also provides essential manpower for DeSilvo's new plan.<br />Meanwhile, the Chronologic Patrol has learned the basics of DeSilvo's activities in the Solar System and has correctly interpreted the clues left for Koffield.  Lieutenant Command Burl Chambers and Lieutenant Temblar are dispatched in a heavily armed and sensored CP intelligence ship to Glister to track down both DeSilvo and Koffield.<br />This is the final volume of the series.  It interjects additional technology from the Dark Museum that expands upon the various fields and drives previously mentioned.  It proposes another method of terraforming without the imbalances of the previously failed methods and suggests yet another approach.  Furthermore, it introduces another model of timetravel within a multiverse of complex diverging and converging timelines.<br />Highly recommended for Allen fans and for anyone else who enjoys high tech suspense stories with political intrigue and interesting characters.	2003-12-02

I would have to disagree with them. This is an unusual book, cutting in its honesty and rationality. Written by one of the most vocal and learned critics today, this book argues for something which concerns the life of art and the place of art in life. At some point in his very active career as curator, critic, and museum director, Spalding decided that he had had enough -- enough of trying to the clothes the Emperor was emphatically NOT wearing. In this book he addresses the question of why he has never met anyone who could, with genuine enthusiam and love, say to him, \\"You simply MUST see this\\" about contemporary art. What is behind the alienation of art from life? Why has art become so solipsistic? So onanistic?<br />Just because he wants to see less offensive material in art, Spalding is not therefore out to argue for something underhahdedly smarmy and specious, like the importance of art's being earnest or being accessible to \\"the people.\\" Spalding is by and large impartial in his attitude toward what art used to be, did, and can still do. In other words, he accepts art's aristocratic alliance as a matter of historical fact. He also accepts the break with tradition that modern art had to accomplish in order to open new horizons. Spalding is neither a condescending snob nor a churlish champion of the hoi poloi, but he presents the situation of today's art as one that has no voice, and no language, to speak to anyone (high or low) but only to its deaf self and a handful of self-appointed members of the pointlessly esoteric priesthood.<br />Spalding has been around a while and has seen much of the making of modern art on both sides of the Atlantic and now tells the story of how, and when (1937) the eclipse of art in our time began so as to put us in total darkness today. But the story he tells is not all gloom and doom. He does not deny that there is great art in our time. But the main focus of his argument is that art has today become, for the most part, something akin to an abomination, and a very tedious and depressing one at that. \\"What is there to really get out of looking at a rotting cow head being eaten by a swarm of flies?\\" he asks rhetorically, referring to what the Tate Modern bought having declared it a significant work of art.<BR>If Spalding seems the odd man out in the art establishment, he probably is. Spalding's stance is simply that of a thinking man who still believes that art's core values are tied to its ability to communicate something about that by which human beings are oriented and reoriented, if strangely, unto some plane of experience most of us feel is higher and more vibrantly life-affirming.<BR>Spalding apparently lacks humor, patience, or artistic acumen, but he just cannot be convinced that human excrement packaged in tin cans is art. And perhaps that's where and how he stands apart from his colleagues at prestigious museums who think nothing of spending $20,000+ for such cans putatively filled with some artist's own excrement. (Not that they ever verified the content.)<br />His argument will have some people throwing eggs and tomatoes at him -- real or cyber -- for not appreciating the spirit of contemporary art. But Spalding presents a very cogent picture of why and how the eclipse -- or a series of eclipses in learning, language, content, and discipline -- came to be historically, and how that eclipse has come to benight art's original and engendering powers.<br />Spalding's vision of art is wide enough, I think, to encompass any medium and style of expression. What he is asking for in art is intelligence. Not cleverness, but intelligence, a show of reflection and care.<BR>What he is arguing against is pseudo-intelligence, pseudo-spirituality, and contrived ideas about creativity. Spalding's argument is not against any particular artists' work but against the entire structure of Byzantine politics and machinations behindthe tyranny of art world's decision-making process. <BR>His plea is one that would have art itself \\"function\\" creatively, not just made in the name of anything-goes. Spalding's general definition of art by way of an attitude is that art is a compression, not just expression, of intelligence, love, observation, insight, reflection, care, and reconfiguration of vital human experience so as to deliver us ultimatley to that realm whose name is now considered taboo to mention: beauty and grace.<br />Spalding's brief analysis of the history of art education in Britain, of Marcel Duchamp's role in the (d)evolution of modern art, and of the reasons behind the rise of Jackson Pollack in the identity-desperate postwar US, and comparison of Pollack's work with that of Edward Hopper are very illuminating even as he tracks the eclipse of art.<br />In Romania a man who had committed suicide by hanging himself in the sculpture garden section of a public park was left hanging for nearly two years because everybody thought it was a \\"work of art.\\" If you think you too might have walked past a dead man thinking it was art just because it was in a \\"art\\" park, then this is a book for you. Highly recommended.	2003-11-27

If by chance you haven't heard of them, these awards are bestowed on individuals who remove themselves, or their ability to reproduce, from the gene pool via the performance of an independently verified act that, in the words of Wendy Northcutt, &quot;transcends stupidity.&quot; There are &quot;honorable mentions&quot; as well, usually bestowed on those who stop just short of unintentionally killing themselves. Northcutt, who invented the Darwin Awards and has a website dedicated to them, has been compiling the award-winning accounts in annual collections.<br />Northcutt does not lack for stories. I believe that everyone will be able to relate to at least a couple of these. I actually have two. A gentleman came into my office several years ago wishing to bring a product liability suit against General Motors. He had purchased a van with a new (at the time) feature called &quot;cruise control.&quot; The new owner took possession of the vehicle, drove it to I-71 South, and after getting the speed up to 60 or so set the cruise control and, in his words, &quot;laid down to take me a nap,&quot; which was soon interrupted when his new purchase met a state-owned guardrail. This unhappy GM customer would not win a Darwin Award because he did not remove himself or his ability to reproduce from the gene pool, but he would almost certainly be considered for an honorable mention. Another gent a few years ago, in an effort to impress upon me the degree and extent of his depression, advised that he had wished to commit suicide. His problem was that he had several .357 caliber bullets, but no corresponding firearm. He accordingly swallowed the bullets and proceeded to hit himself in the stomach with a hammer. It didn't work.<br />These stories are not in THE DARWIN AWARDS III, though they could have been. If you found those stories interesting, or even hilarious, you will absolutely love pouring through this book. The stories are divided into six classifications: &quot;Law Enforcement: Crime Does Pay,&quot; &quot;Men: Omega Male,&quot; &quot;Explosions: Short Sharp Shock,&quot; &quot;Women: Female Finale,&quot; &quot;Technology: Deus Ex Machina,&quot; and &quot;Disqualified: Glory Days Gone.&quot; The latter chapter consists of stories that were ultimately disqualified from consideration for a Darwin Award but are nonetheless amusing in their own right. As with any story, a great deal of the entertainment is in the telling, and Northcutt has the perfect literary voice for relating these tales of people who get run over by trains while listening for them or the jet ski bandits who are non-recidivists forevermore.<br />The book is also lovingly and irreverently illustrated, in part by Malcolm McGookin. McGookin drew the devastatingly brilliant cartoon Danger Mouse, among others, and has had his cartoons featured in everything from children's publications to Penthouse. If memory serves, he drew my favorite Penthouse cartoon of all time, which was captioned &quot;She types like a secretary.&quot; I'll let you figure it out.<br />THE DARWIN AWARDS III can be read from cover to cover or picked up and opened at random. Either way, prepare to spend an hour or so with the book each time you open it. It is entertaining, informative and at once inspiring and depressing. Who could ask for more?<br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub	2003-11-26

I had gone to church all of my life and I always said that I believed the Bible, but someone  challenged me about what the purpose of life was.  At that point I said, hmm... You can't say you believe something if you've never read it, but, just heard it read in bits and pieces here and there.  So, I began reading at Genesis and got part way through Psalms the first part of that summer.  The first 3 books were difficult because of the King James version language, but after that I got used to it and it didn't matter. At that time I had an experience in which a Supreme Being revealed Himself to me.  I was outside crying one night, and all of the sudden I had a sense that a Supreme Being was in control of my life, and there was nothing I could do that could change that.  The thought was both sad, and comforting at the same time.  After that a number of things happened that proved something spiritual in nature had happened to me. (I won't go into them.) I became a very confident person after this experience when before I was not.  I ended up finishing reading the Bible, and have read it a number of times since.  About 10 years later, I went to a kind of church that I hadn't gone to before, and I did a search of the Holy Spirit, a whole lot in the Bible. (Along with some other books and talking with someone about the Holy Spirit.)  It happened again.  A Supreme Being revealed Himself to me.  I was trying to figure out what speaking in tongues was, because some of the people in the church that I went to did that, and most of the chuches that I'd been to all my life didn't teach much about that.  One night I was talking with God about something that was troubling me a lot and all of the sudden I was speaking in a different language.  That was speaking in tongues. It was a miracle because I didn't know the language that I was speaking.  Linguists have studied speaking in tongues and the languages have been verified as actual languages, not just gibberish.  Another time when I was 33, I was teaching school in a very rough area in Los Angeles.  There was a lot alot alot of bad stuff going on with my students.  At night when I lay on my bed and read the Bible, I could just feel positive waves coming up from it as I read it.  Another time when I was 40, I had finished teaching school in Los Angeles and I was very depressed because of the experience.  I hadn't read the Bible much in a long time, and I crammed reading it by reading this version in a Topical Bible form.  I read tons and tons really fast.  I felt a burden on me all of the sudden because of the things the Bible asks a person to do, and, I also felt a very great joy from reading it.  I love the King James version.  I'm writing my autobiography right now and a lot of the chapter titles and even the title of the book are phrases from the King James version of the Bible. The Bible seems strange, but, I have to remind myself that it's about a time 1000's of years ago and it's happening in cultures VERY different than mine also.  When I taught school, my students were required to memorize both huge sections of the Bible, and, also huge poems.  I memorized these along with my students.  I found that the poems were very, very easy to memorize, but, that the Bible sections were much, much, much, much, much more difficult to memorize, and, I believe it is because the Bible says a lot of stuff in very few words. It is very concentrated.  I've noticed that some people in chuches that I've gone to have never sat down and read the entire Bible.  They're trying to go to church and live by the Bible but they've never read it. It doesn't work.  Most of their life is just guessing what they're supposed to do if they are a Christian, and, they get it wrong, plus, there's nothing spiritual going on there if they don't read the Bible, and, find out who God is because the spiritual comes through a relationship with Him.	2003-11-25

However, the writing style of the author is poor and very choppy, making it difficult to follow the material.  The author uses an excessive amount of real-world examples, but does little justice to covering and explaining the theory and concepts of the subject material.<br />I purchased a used 7th edition of this text book through Amazon.com.  The pervious owner of my book (a student, I assume) noted several errors in the book.  For example, in Chapter 3, \\"The Diverse Workforce:...\\", page 81, heading \\"INDIVIDUAL VALUES AND ATTITUDES\\", subheading \\"Values\\", paragraph 2, sentence 1, the published text states:<br />\\"Core values are more susceptible to change, and peripheral values are less susceptible (to change).\\"<br />However, the sentence in my text book was manually corrected by the previous owner (at the direction of an instructor at another educational institution, I assume) to read:<br />\\"Core values are less susceptible to change, and peripheral values are more susceptible (to change).\\"<br />When I first read the sentence, I could not agree with what the author had stated.  So I did a search on Google.com and verified from other sources that the author had incorrectly stated this premise.<br />In Chapter 9, Activity 9-5 Behavior Description Questionnaire, page 319, the book provides a table for scoring a 30 statement behavior questionnaire.  The activity requires one to select between an A or B statement which is characteristic of their own behavior.  However, item number 6 in the scoring table shows two A answers, and item number 7 in the scoring table shows two B answers, making it impossible to obtain an accurate assessment of one's behavior pattern, unless one is able to clearly understand the subject material and correct the scoring table.<br />These are just a few of the errors noted in the 7th edition of this publication.  It appears the author has not adequately proofread the final product.	2003-11-22

De La Pena presents a battle recollection not unlike many soldiers' accounts. Perhaps miscounting the numbers of burning corpses on a pyre, or the number of men killed and wounded, etc.,as many memoirs do, he nevertheless opens a window to the horrors and cruelties of the battle and its aftermath. Bayonets or no bayonets?  Note that in a report of the inventories of arms and equipment in the town, the arsenal, and the Alamo itself, turned over to Col. F. W. Johnson by subordinates of General Cos in Dec, 1835, there were 257 carbines and muskets, 50 muskets with bayonets, two barrels containing 166 bayonets,thousands of musket cartridges, and hundreds of pounds of powder.  The Texans had more ammunition and weaponry than they could use,plenty of bayonets included. There was more artillery in the fort (est 13 -21 guns) than in the Mexican army (10 guns).  What the Texans lacked was manpower to use all that equipment. Maybe some of them did stack loaded weapons in ready. Flintlocks can be loaded, but not primed...it's the priming that usually dampens and causes misfires (personal experience). Some of the defenders were members of militia units and knew how to handle military weapons. De La Pena's views actually lean toward much that is verified elsewhere, but they often are contrary to many of the fanciful beliefs and various speculations associated with this battle. His description of the prisoner incident is a genuine attempt by a soldier to record a brutal event that he found to be distasteful and dishonorable...not unlike Crockett's own recollection of his disgust with the Creek War.  This book should be carefully read and evaluated by any student of the Alamo.  De La Pena is certainly more likely to have been an eyewitness, than any of his modern critics, regardless of whether or not he made errors.	2003-11-21

The long awaited next book in James Patterson's Alex Cross series is back with Alex now beginning his FBI career after being recruited by the new director Ron Burns. Readers of the series know that Alex has decided it is time to leave the Washington PD and continue his career elsewhere. Despite Alex's trepidations about bureaucracy within \\"The Bureau\\", Burns has convinced Alex that his police instincts and profiling skills would be incredibly useful as Burns tries to achieve the seemingly impossible task of eliminating both the bureaucrats and cowboys from the FBI's ranks. This is typical James Patterson, mostly two to four page chapters, a  rapidly developing plot, minimal character development, and a clever villain with a violent streak. In juxtaposition is the pull of Alex's family, Little Alex, Jannie, Damon and Nana Mama as well as his long distance relationship with Jamilla Hughes. <br />While Alex is involved in his FBI intake orientation and training, a series of widely scattered and very unusual unsolved abductions cause Director Burns to involve Alex in the case, creating enmity within the ranks (including from Alex's superior) due to the special treatment that he receives. There are no ransom demands, and Alex and his associates believe that the victims are being sold and traded as part of a white slave ring operated by wealthy individuals with bizarre and illegal inclinations. When two particularly high profile  kidnappings catch the attention of the media, pressure increases on the FBI to solve the case and (not unexpectedly) a few clues create the suspicion  that a shadowy figure (THE WOLF) whose existence has never been verified by the FBI is at the center of this kidnapping ring. He is reputed to be a former KGB agent who now is head of the Red Mafiya in the US, but there have been no clues to his identity or location. A few breaks create momentum that eventually makes Alex optimistic that they are on the trail of THE BIG BAD WOLF, but of course youknow the villain will create several instances of misdirection and layers of reality for his pursuers to fight through. Meanwhile, Alex's personal world is rocked by the reappearance of Christine Johnson (Little Alex's mother) in DC and her desire to become a part of her child's life despite her (temporary and understandable) abandonment of him given the turmoil that a previous case of Alex's had caused in her life.<br />This is a fastmoving, intricately plotted very fast read - you would be surprised at anything else in an Alex Cross story. And you have the \\"pleasure\\" of seeing Kyle Craig continue to play a (very peripheral ) role in Alex's life. The background element regarding the need to reform the FBI echoes the daily headlines and rings true. While the thread regarding Christine is interesting, there is much less involvement of Alex's family than in several of the other books. There is a great degree of violence, including the sexual incidents which are an integral part of the story, but in most cases the descriptions are very brief, and in only a few cases is there nauseous detail. Besides the obvious pursuit of the WOLF and the discovery of his real identity, the biggest mystery that the reader faces is whether this is a self contained story or whether it will simply be the first installment of several stories regarding the necessity of unraveling the several layers of the WOLF's identity. (You won't find out until the last ten pages.) And at the same time it is not clear whether Alex's complex relationships with Jamilla and Christine will be resolved. The factors that kept this from attaining a five star rating were the even more than usual number of loose ends to the story and the complete lack of any character development at all. I was especially disappointed at the minor role of  Lili Olsen, a fourteen and a half year old (\\"going on twenty-four\\") computer genius whose abilities to hack into web sites help Alex despite the skepticism of his associates. She seemed a wonderful character with a lot of potential, but with the exception of one memorable line she simply disappeared as the story plunged forward. <br />So when you want a quick read for a short flight or a rainy day, you will enjoy this if the Patterson formula appeals to you. But don't expect much detail, and be ready to suspend your belief about the plausibility of many of the events. Certainly not his best, but much more enjoyable than many for me because of the lack of gruesome detail contained in some of his other books.<br />Tucker Andersen	2003-11-19

It attempts what many would regard as impossible or inadvisable - a kind of classification of the different kinds of subtle, subjective energy-qualities of a selection of 56 global-scale sacred sites. This is a minefield into which few would care tread, but I think Leviton has trodden well, and doesn't fall into the quicksands.<br />It is difficult to try to objectivise subjective impressions - the archetypal impressions one can gain when visiting an ancient site. From his own observations, and from the histories of the sites he has chosen, Leviton has identified specific threads of energy-quality pervading these sites - a system he then applies throughout the book. He has traced these threads through different sites, establishing the energy-connections between them.<br />This is a subjective work which can be verified only by the subjective agreement of other students of geomancy (or what he calls 'visionary geography'). Yet I think the author has done well, all things considered. His is one of the best perceptions of the particular sacred site where I live - Glastonbury - and the other sites he covers that I personally know are also quite well worked out. I think this book holds up quite well, therefore. The histories and traditions he gives of each site are interesting too, and well researched.<br />It's the kind of book you keep for ongoing reference. His idea that the stars of the celestial realm are specifically reflected here on Earth in ancient sites is not new, but I haven't seen this systematically and globally applied before. He has created classes of subtle energy - such as Mithraeum, Labyrinth, Lucifer Binding Site or Cosmic Egg - which I find possible to take in and work with, and translate into my own terms.<br />Altogether, an interesting book. If you're interested in sacred sites and the subtle energy-grid of the Earth - areas of research which will take decades to make sense of - then this is a good starting place. Leviton has done a lot of work and mulling with this book - seminal inasmuch as it deserves to start a small movement of people further researching this important area of geomancy.	2003-11-16

To think that this kid was able to convince people that he was a pilot for a major airline, a pediatrician, a lawyer (who actually passed the BAR exam without ever taking even one course in law school!), and a college professor... not to mention the most prolific bum check artist that ever lived!!!  <br />You can read many reviews here that condemn Mr. Abagnale's actions and feel that he glamorizes theft and deception.  But even young Abagnale had a sense of morality, albeit a bit skewed.  He would not allow himself to swindle the common man or take money from anyone who could not afford the hit.  <br />Upon maturity (and after doing some hard time) he found that he could use his talents and knowledge to help educate and protect the very same companies and institutions from being defrauded by other would-be &quot;Frank Abagnales&quot;.  There is little doubt that his expertise in this area and his willingness to share his knowledge with them has saved these companies billions of dollars.  So if you really think about it, the banks and corporations that he conned actually just paid into a scholarship fund for someone who, down the road, went to work for them!  Alas, poor Pan Am paid the bulk of his tuition.    <br />This is a brilliant, brilliant book...I simply could not put it down.  It is very well written and extremely entertaining.    It is simply incredible that this is not a work of fiction... everything can be verified.  The best book I have read in years.	2003-11-11

Of course, McGilligan could argue that it isn't his book that's offensive, but the life of its subject. I think it's a little of both.<br />If McGilligan is correct, Eastwood's public image is a sham. Widely praised for his loyalty, the Eastwood in McGilligan's book banishes lifelong friends from his circle should they dare ask for even a tiny crumb of the pie they helped bake. Producers, directors, editors, writers, all of them working for comparative peanuts, become &quot;non-persons&quot; in the eyes of Clint the squint, and they are exiled from his Malpaso production company and from the film industry itself because, they insist, the big man is vindictive, and uses his considerable influence to deprive them of their right to make a living. But the macho icon is also a coward who loathes confrontation and never fires anyone directly, letting others do his dirty work for him. Rich beyond mere tabulation, Dirty Harry's Republican alter ego slams welfare and brags that he worked for &quot;every crust of bread&quot; he ever ate, yet never pays for a meal, insisting on being &quot;comped&quot; wherever he goes. And as a filmmaker, his legendary habit of delivering films ahead of schedule and under budget is nothing but carelessness and a wiliness to accept subpar work to keep his budgets low and his percentages high.<br />He's also a womanizer whose relationships produced numerous illegitimate children, an opportunist who used his brief reign as Mayor of Carmel for his own financial gain, and a father in name only.<br />Then there's that temper. Anyone who dares park in his unmarked space on the Warner lot will know holy terror as Eastwood vandalizes their vehicle with a golf club, hammer, or a pickup truck. Good luck if you sue him in court, especially with a judge who asks for his autograph.<br />As someone who always thought highly of Eastwood personally no matter what I thought of his films (most of which I admire), I found this account of his life rather disturbing, but the book is disturbing in ways that have more to do with McGilligan than Eastwood. The punctuation is often a mess with periods appearing outside quotation marks, and the spelling is often questionable, with the author spelling tires as &quot;tyres&quot; when describing the ludicrous climax of The Gauntlet. Maybe the guy is English and doesn't always Americanize his language but the biographical notes describe him as living in Missouri, so that may not be an excuse.<br />There are also more substantial errors. McGilligan has Ronald Reagan appropriating Dirty Harry's famous &quot;Make my day&quot; speech from Sudden Impact in March 1983, nine months before the film is released. And he gets other dates wrong: In his world, Paint Your Wagon opened a year later than it did, and Escape from Alcatraz debuts in the Christmas season of 1979 when, in fact, it opened the previous June. One can excuse errors here and there, but release dates can be easily verified, and McGilligan makes them consistently. If he can't get a film's release date right, how much faith can we have in his account of incidents from Eastwood's life, incidents at which the author was not present?<br />If nothing else, this book's sloppy research suggests McGilligan suffers from one of the same personality flaws for which he frequently reprimands his subject. Eastwood, he says, is always happy with the first draft of the screenplays he stars in and/or directs, never requesting and always resisting rewrites (perhaps because they require shelling out cash, something the miserly multi-millionaire is loathe to do). McGilligan's book reads like a first draft that never made it to the proofreader. Perhaps a quote from the Bibleis in order here: &quot;Judge not lest ye be judged.&quot;<br />McGilligan's book is certainly an improvement over Richard Shickel's earlier look at the Hollywood titan. McGilligan is fairly thorough, offering more information about Eastwood's ancestry than we might even want to know about our own, and providing a more subjective view of the star's contribution to the cinema. Thankfully, he never fawns over Eastwood the way &quot;critic&quot; Schickel did in his &quot;authorized&quot; bio, but one may be tempted to wonder if he went too far in the opposite direction.ible is in order here: &quot;Judge not lest ye be judged.&quot;<br />McGilligan's book is certainly an improvement over Richard Shickel's earlier look at the Hollywood titan.

The best thing one can say about this pathetic book it that the warning is right there on the cover- IT SUCKS! The latest in a long line of pathetic books by Mark Stevens, a wanna-be guru and self-proclaimed marketing expert. His latest collection of simplistic hype rounds out a long list of gems including How to Borrow a Million Dollars (credit card schemes?), Extreme Management (extreme confusion), How to Pyramid Small Business Ventures into a Personal Fortune (pyramid schemes?) - you get the idea.<br />Characteristically unoriginal, pompous, and lacking substance, this latest mess is designed to impress the easily duped into using Mark Stevens as a consultant. The book is hollow, a rehash of basic marketing and sales principles. Based on Stevens' stressing ROI, one would have expected him to litter his work with testimonials from what should be hundreds of thrilled and fawning clients? And one has to wonder what his real clients have to say. If he's so amazing, his clients must have the best marketing in the world! He's the expert and he puts these principles to work every day right? For zillions of clients, right? What? No willing droves of converts or devotees? Aren't there any real-world examples with verified ROI results? Why not?<br />Instead, it is quickly obvious that the author has had no real successes or he would have mentioned them. Maybe he's just really upset his firm has never won any real awards. All one can deduce is that Stevens' own marketing sucked so much he had the time to kick back and write a book. Doesn't sound like a guy that's all that busy working with real clients. Or maybe his prospects prefer more substance and less snake oil. Like they say, those that can - do. Those that suck - write stupid books.	2003-11-05

And reading this book verified this.  I laughed a great deal, but a lot of the material also made me think that perhaps we should consider this a warning.  Are we Americans getting stupider?  Given the material collected here (especially the &quot;Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Government&quot; chapters) I felt this might be evidenced.  One thing I feel I should mention is that the authors are very evenhanded in skewering all sorts of people.  There appears to be no &quot;hidden agenda&quot; in terms of exposing stupidity, which is very laudable.  They say that stupidity happens regardless of party, color or creed.  This is a good thing to see, by my standards.<br />Most important, though, these folks did make me laugh (and think).  I enjoyed this book tremendously on both counts and do recommend it for others.	2003-11-04

Since the media is a follow-the-leader game, once a frame takes hold it doesn't let go very easily.  Jamieson and Waldman use this theory mainly to explore the 2000 Election between Gore and Bush.<br />Gore's many misstatements through his political career led the press to frame him as dishonest.  Bush's flubs through his short political career convinced the press to put him in the frame of unintelligent.  The result were campaign stories that asked voters to choose between the smart, but untrustworthy Gore and the dumb but affable Bush.  The examples of media coverage in the book support this theory pretty well.<br />Next the authors cite the examples of Gore's untruths and basically defend each one as a misunderstanding, leaving Gore as a more honest individual than painted by the media.  As a reader, I anticipated the authors next explaining that Bush was actually a smarter man than he was given credit for, after all he has an MBA from Harvard.  Instead the authors quote a New Yorker article where a reporter cites George W. Bush's average grades at Yale.  This is was a surprise, because the story was unverified by Yale and it doesn't take into account that grades have much more to do with ambition and drive than intelligence.  There was no attempt to give Bush the same credit that the authors spent giving Gore.  An opportunity to support their main thesis was left on the floor, which gives one the feeling that the real purpose of the book is to defend Gore not shame the media.  This same pattern is repeated when the authors discuss the Florida recount.<br />It's unfortunate that Jamieson and Waldman abandon the scholarly for the advocacy role because there is a lot of other research in the book that seems dead on.  They bemoan that fact that reporters do a terrible job of verifying the evidence and drawing conclusions.  Instead, the authors argue that the media play into the &quot;he said, she said&quot; game of political strategy.  The story becomes about how the candidates disagree with each other on their positions more than the actual substance of those positions.  They also state that the media loves to play psychologist when they should instead be playing fact-finder.<br />I found the basic theories in the book supported by good evidence.  But the advocacy of Gore and the silence on Bush in the analysis sections detracted from the book's purported goal of exposing the media's laziness.  I'm sure that the authors would say that they had no intention of propping up Gore, but parts of the book seem to strengthen the media frame on Bush which weakens the overall argument of the book.  This is surprising since Bush could have been defended as easily as Gore.<br />Anyway, I think the authors do a fine job casting a spotlight on the media's &quot;follow the leader&quot; approach and that's enough recommend it despite my other misgivings.ence and drawing conclusions.

Unless you are familar with the locations mentioned in this book, verify the information from another source before using it as a travel guide.  This book was not researched properly or edited.  Nearly all the locations in this book appears in other sources including other published books and old copies of the different Chicago and other local suburban newspapers dating back to the 1970's and 80's.  The large Chicago papers have printed most of these stories annually around Halloween since at least the 1970's.  This is what makes it hard to believe there are errors in this book.  Considering it says the Author is a native of the Chicago area she must never have left her office to verify locations she put in her book.  For example, it says Morton College on Harlem Ave. in Berwyn, Illinois is haunted.  The problem is that Morton College is located on Central Ave. in Cicero, Illinois and that is the haunted location--some 4 miles apart.  Morton West High School is located on Harlem in Berwyn and is not known to be haunted at all.  Also it is never mentioned that prior to the 1970's, Morton College was originally located in Morton East High School on Austin Blvd. in Cicero and that building is also known to be haunted.  If an error like this made it into the book, I would question the accuracy of the other parts of the book.  The correct address of the college could be gotten from calling the college itself.  Considering public and academic librarians have been using the internet for research since early-1990's, many of these errors could have been avoided by simple online searches.  I have been referring my graduate students to the internet for years to do simple online research, and now nearly everything is online.  When I worked on my undergraduate work in the 1980's the internet was not around, but completing my two masters degrees (one in library science) and now my second doctorate, the internet has been valuable.  As a college professor, I can say no college, university, or professor would accept inaccurate, unverified work, with missing information.  Work like this could not come from a respected researcher or writer.  I place some blame on the editors unless this was self-published, and then the blame is completely on the author.	2003-11-03

This I found interesting.  However, during this discussion the author demonized one Earl Butz, Secretary of Agriculture under Nixon.  I was a mere child during Nixon's years, so I know nothing of Earl Butz and therefore can't say one way or the other if he was the demon incarnate that the author makes him out to be or not.  Throughout the book, the author blames Butz for all of the evil fat-making foods on the market today.  This seems implausible to me that one single man could be responsible for so much.  I think it's more likely that these new processes of HFCS and palm oil was an *industry* trend that would have taken hold regardless of who happened to be Secretary of Agriculture.<br />Another annoyance is the author's strained efforts to make it seem like there's a conspiracy going on to fatten up the poor and non-white minorities in this country.  One such ludicrous example he gave was of the opening of a Krispy Kreme franchise in a Latino area of Southern California.  The author tries very hard, and unconvincingly, to use the fact that cars were lined up around the block for KK's opening as proof that the poor are targeted for fatty foods.  Is the author completely unaware that *every* KK opening is accompanied by lines of cars around the block, even in upper-class white-bread neighborhoods?!  How does a line of cars around a KK prove *anything*?<br />I'll list only one more annoyance, as I am probably approaching my 1000-word maximum!  The author quotes manystudies and draws completely illogical conclusions from them to support his conspiracy-theory hypothesis.  Several times, he compares figures for those in the under $25K/yr income bracket to those in the over $50K/yr bracket.  Each time he did this, I had to ask myself, what about the $25K-50K bracket?  Did he consistently leave the figures for this group out because the data for that category didn't support his weak and falacious hypothesis?  The language this supposed journalist uses shows he is far from your classical objective journalist.  He spends a lot of time blaming Proposition 13 (California, late 70s) for many fat-related woes, and refers to the proposition's author as &quot;cigar-chomping&quot; ... clearly intended to give us a negative image.   Later on in the book, he cites a study whose conclusions are rather shaky and unverified, but which, if true, would bolster his hypothesis.  So, how does he address this?  He states, &quot;Although [the conclusions of this study are] still somewhat speculative, the state-of-the-art explanation runs thus:...&quot;  How genially and complimentary he can write of an unsubstantiated theory as long as it helps prop up his hypothesis!<br />In summary, this book contains one or two interesting pieces of information on bad food ingredients (HFCS and palm oil), but having to read through the author's amateurish and hackneyed presentation along with stunning illogical support for his theories, makes this book extremely unworthy of anyone's time.	2003-11-02

Of course, McGilligan could argue that it isn't his book that's offensive, but the life of its subject. I think it's a little of both.<br />If McGilligan is correct, Eastwood's public image is a sham.

Rampton and Stauber of &quot;Toxic Sludge is Good For You&quot; fame have done it again: yet another disturbing account of how PR concerns have hijacked the relationship between the media and the Pentagon. &quot;Weapons of Mass Deception&quot; is a quick but pithy read, exposing such deceptions as the multiple erroneous claims by the administration tagging sanction-starved Iraq as the next Axis power -and the PR-manipulated failure of the media to adequately publicize retractions of these claims in the proper detail. Their references are easily verified, as most are publicly-available internet resources. Although a bit fatalistic at times, Rampton and Stauber's exposition is made even more relevant by recent events, like the outing/attempted silencing of CIA agent and WMD operative Valerie Plame. Disrupting the flow of disinformation means taking the demand for a special prosecutor in this case to the public.

In this book, Carrington answered most of the unanswered questions I had about meditation. I've been reading about and practicing meditation for 25 years now, and I had some questions lurking in the back of my mind like: Are some mantras really better than others? Is it possible to meditate too much? (And if so, how much is too much?) Is there any scientific evidence that meditation makes you more creative? Can it make you less productive? Carrington answers these questions and many more in The Book of Meditation. And her answers are not derived from tradition or what her teachers told her, but from compelling evidence and controlled experiments.<br />And yet she doesn't dismiss tradition as long as it hasn't been proven wrong in experiments. For example, in some traditions, certain mantras are considered dangerous for beginners. There have been no experiments to find out if this is true or not, so she removed those from her list of recommended mantras in her How To Meditate Kit. Her approach is balanced and reasonable. <br />Carrington is not only a researcher but also a psychotherapist and many of her illustrations are patients she has treated, giving a real-live feel to the points she's making. Her examples are interesting and illustrate her points well.<br />Half a chapter was devoted to one excellent example: The New York Telephone Company. Gilbeart Collings, the NYTC medical director, asked Carrington to find out if meditation would reduce employee stress. The first test was on 160 employees and lasted five and a half months. Stress-related physical symptoms dropped dramatically. That's why the company offered the program to the whole company. <br />They eventually taught almost 5000 employees of the NYTC to meditate. Thousands of these meditators were interviewed about the changes taking place in their lives. They felt less tension. Their irritability and hostility dropped dramatically, and so did feelings of anxiety. People reported feeling more tolerant andpatient and less distressed by everyday frustrations. The meditators said they were listening better, feeling more open, acting and feeling kinder toward others, and in general being more like the person they've always wanted to be, at work and at home. This matches what I have found to be true in my own life, but it's great to hear it verified by others.<br />I really liked her chapter, Why Does Meditation Work? That is the exact wording of a question I typed into Google, which is how I found her book. The chapter looks at several explanations of how the various effects of meditation converge to produce such powerful benefits.<br />I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, which is not about meditation, but I can tell you that meditation (taught the way Carrington teaches it) may be the most important self-help stuff you can practice. It works. And this is the best book on meditation I've ever read.	2003-10-22

But whatever one feels about gay and lesbian issues, an objective reading of the book makes one thing clear: authors Sears and Osten do showcase an agenda ... but it is not a homosexual one.<br />Rather than present a logical case supported by clearly documented evidence, the authors of The Homosexual Agenda employ the following devices:<br />1) Framing. Persuasion presents facts in hope of shaping opinion, but framing manipulates audiences through subtle use of language. Again and again, the authors of The Homosexual Agenda resort to framing:<br />- Books, movies, television shows, and even schoolbooks are never said to 'refer to' or 'address' homosexuality; instead, they are consistently described as 'promoting' it. As a result, any reference to gays or lesbians is framed as part of a massive conspiracy to 'promote' homosexuality.<br />- Throughout the book, the authors avoid referring to anyone as simply being homosexual; instead, gay and lesbian people are consistently represented as 'entrapped' or 'ensnared' in 'homosexual behavior.' By repeatedly employing the vocabulary of slavery and bondage, the authors frame gay and lesbian people as victims in need of rescue, and, by extention, position themselves as heroes on a mission of rescue and emancipation.<br />2) Omission. The introduction of the book features the story of alleged ex-homosexual John Paulk, positioning him as 'one of the most courageous individuals' who has 'overcome homosexual behavior' (pp. 2 and 3). After an ad campaign positioned him as the public face of the ex-gay movement, Paulk was photographed drinking and conversing with other patrons of a Washington, D.C. gay bar. Conveniently, the authors' version of Paul's story neglects to mention this incident or Paulk's subsequent removal from the board of Exodus International, an ex-gay ministry.<br />Further, while the authors confess they 'personally know only a few ex-homosexuals,' they go on to say they 'know there are thousands of ... [ex-gays] throughout America.' If this is the case, one would expect the authors to provide clear, well-documented, and independently-verified evidence of the success of so-called 'conversion therapy.' Unfortunately, the authors do not offer any such evidence, nor do they inform readers that leaders of the three most prominent ex-gay ministries (Exodus International, Homosexuals Anonymous, and Desert Stream) have been sued or expelled for engaging in sexual activity with those they are professing to cure.<br />3) Generalization. The hallmark of bigotry, generalizations are blanket statements associating certain traits with every member of a group, as in, 'All African-Americans love watermelon' or 'All Jews are good with money.'<br />Throughout the book, the authors generalize all gay people as aggressive political extremists living a lifestyle rooted in 'despair, disease and early death' (p. 3). The authors repeatedly cite extreme cases, positioning them as typical, as a means of associating all gay and lesbian people with fringe sexual practices (p. 19 and 64), pedophilia (p. 66) and even the Nazis (p.26).<br />Another passage generalizes lesbians, describing a young woman whose 'sweet face had been hardened, and '[whose] kind manner was nothing more than a memory' because she 'was trapped in a lesbian lifestyle' (p. 73). And of course, by titling their book The Homosexual Agenda, the authors not only assert the existence of such an agenda, but also imply all homosexual people  share it.<br />4) Projection. Projection identifies in others actions and attitudes we deny in ourselves. For example, the authors position a list of events they claim are steps toward 'the moral demise of a culture:' the establishment of community awareness, organization for empowerment, strategic mobilization, and efforts toward legitimization (p. 14). These may accurately be described as stages of political activity ... but are they indeed stages of moral decline? If so, the authors are contributing to it: in this book, they call on fundamentalist Christians to establish their own community awareness, political organization, and strategic mobilization.<br />5) Contradiction. Early in the book, the authors claim gays and lesbians are an extremely small minority ... no more than '1 to 2 percent' of the population (p. 17). Later, however, they assert homosexuals control the media, the entertainment industry, the public schools, the nation's colleges and universities, and corporate America. How can homosexuals be both virtually non-existent and omnipresent?<br />Throughout the book, authors Sears and Osten repeatedly characterize themselves as loving, sincere, respectful, and compassionate. Whatever their demeanor, the methods they employ as authors do not inspire confidence in their arguments. By pandering to their readers' worst fears and greatest insecurities, they have written a book that reflects (and occasionally even borrows from) the last century's worst examples of racist propaganda.<br />The Homosexual Agenda will be eagerly embraced by extremists who already share Sears and Ostens conclusions. More careful readers, however, will identify this book for what it is: a manipulative attempt to polarize conservatives by fanning the flames of hatred, prejudice, and fear.tion, and efforts toward legitimization (p. 14).

You can't phone it in, and producers don't have the time or the inclination to track down scripts... they are sent 100 a week to choose from.  This book is worse advice than you would get in one night of hanging out at any bar in LA that real, credited writers go to.  I mean, look at the other credits this writer has... &quot;your modeling career&quot;... what the heck sort of background does this give so that the writer can speak to script writing, being that he has no script sales (verified by using Studio System, the entertainment industry database) or movies to his credit?  The advice in here is plain, common sense, not insightful... and what the other poster said about telling Black writers where to get the best fried chicken in LA is just the sort of stuff you get.  He spends three pages detailing how many brads to bind scripts with... and if you actaully talk to any agent, the truth is they don't care.

Validity to the data is accurate. The argument idealist liberals have is if gun's didn't exist in the culture violence wouldn't exist. This is not the case.. Currently a rise in crime (with firearms as the weapon of choice) is on the rise in Great Britain primarily it is believe to be a direct correlation to the restrictions placed on LEGAL individual firearms ownership. In states that have active conceal/carry laws in the US and since enacting those laws crimes have decreased. <br />While liberals would like to have this fact withheld from the public it is well documented in NICS and DOJ records. <br />Don't think for a second a firearm in the hands of a criminal is going to go away with making firearms illegal.. The only thing that will happen is criminals will be able to perpetrate their activity in an unencumbered manner. <br />Gun Control does not effectively stop criminal behavior. It does not stop death of innocents. Enforcing the existing 20,000 plus firearms laws in US has failed miserably since the 1968 NFA. Crime deterrence is when a criminal knows full well they may face lethal force if they commit a crime. When the libs get it out of their head that criminals don't want to sit around the campfire and sing Kumbaya with them their eyes might be open.	2003-10-16

John Shelby Spong wrote this book for people who could no longer accept the standard Christian theology. That certainly includes me, so I read his book with great interest. In many ways he mirrors my own thinking, but his long ecclesiastical background as an Episcopal Bishop gives us different vantage points.<br />Spong says the old concept of a theistic God is no longer useful in a modern world. God is not a person who lives in the sky and tinkers with our lives and sits in judgment. The steady march of knowledge about the vastness of the universe and our puny place in it has made that God obsolete. Spong is at his best when he is tracing the biblical roots of this God and showing how they arose, not out of any divine revelation, but were the natural product of the tribal societies with whom they originated.<br />I loved his chapter on \\"Jesus as Rescuer\\" in which he demolishes the doctrine that \\"Jesus died for our sins.\\" He goes on to argue against the Virgin Birth and Immaculate Conception, showing how, to people of the time, a sinless Jesus needed sinless progenitors. I was amused at his discourse on the Ten Commandments, as he actually pronounces some of them \\"immoral.\\" That's pretty heavy stuff. I was brought up Catholic, and I don't think the Catholic Church will be following Bishop Spong into rejection of these long-standing Christian ideas. I don't know much about Episcopalians (a church started by a king who wanted to divorce -- make that murder -- his wife!) but it seems to me these doctrines are the lever used to control people and perpetuate the church. The church will never let them go.<br />That brings me to my differences with Spong. He continually uses the word \\"worship;\\" he uses the word to mean the activity that goes on inside churches. It seems to me he has hung onto this word because there is no meaningful word for the hodgepodge of activities that occur inside church buildings. As to the word itself, surely a God who is in all of us and who encompasses the vast universe has no need to be worshiped. The whole idea of worshiping God is also obsolete, along with the other concepts Spong so deftly kills off.<br />I think he also misses the mark in his discussion of prayer. He asks why someone who is prayed for should recover from their illness while someone who is not prayed for does not recover. What kind of a God would be so influenced? What is wrong with this analysis, in my opinion, is the inclusion of God, who does not have to be involved in what we call prayer at all. Just as we do not need to worship God, neither do we need to petition him/her. Prayer, I believe, is really an aspect of non-local consciousness. It is a type of psychic phenomena if you will, a way one mind or spirit reaches out to another. The question is not who we pray TO but who we pray FOR.  We touch the other person or event with our spirit or inner energy. Prayer can be studied scientifically (to some extent) and studies have been done that seem to indicate prayer works.<br />In the same way, Spong does not offer us much in his discussion of life after death. While I like a lot of what he said about the value of what we do in this life, the real question is what happens when we die. Christian doctrine on this has emphasized the divine judgment which separates the good from the bad, relegating us to heaven or hell. Spong traces the theological roots back to the theistic God who is like a good parent, and the way these concepts of the next life were used by the church to control behavior in this life.<br />But is the concept of life after death totally bound up with reward and punishment? I think not. Today we have much evidence from Near Death Experience (NDE) and Out of Body Experience (OBE) and the testimony of mystics like Robert Monroe. There is a mini boom in contacting the dead (consider the popularity of John Edward's \\"Crossing Over\\") and millions of people accept these sources as proof that our spirits go on after we \\"cross over.\\" Again, where is God? He/she does not have to be in this equation either. The evidence seems to indicate that we take our emotional baggage with us to the other side, and we continue to grow spiritually in this new realm.<br />I also need to mention his attitude toward Jesus. Of course as a priest and bishop, Spong has had Jesus contiually in his life, and to say Jesus is just an interesting character in some ancient and unverified stories would be too painful. But Spong is willing to relegate many items in the Bible to mythical status, so why does he accept some (not all) of what is said about Jesus? Even interpreting the unacceptable (the birth in a stable, attended by three wise men, for instance) in new ways is hedging on whether anything written about Jesus is true. I agree that Jesus as described in the New Testament has much to offer. But how can we know what really happened thousands of years ago when the only testimony was written years later and has the bias of its time? Spong will not eliminate Jesus from his belief system, but many others who haven't spent decades in liturgical orthodoxy will.<br />So do all these transformations of the old Christian ideas mean there is no God? Not at all. I agree generally with Spong in his conclusions, but he is tied to his ecclesiastical past in a way that I am not. While I think churches have contributed to society by bringing people together and creating social bonds, and often doing good works, I cannot see how they can go on when the basic reason for their existence -- their theology, including Jesus -- can no longer be believed. Spong concludes his book by saying \\"I expect to enter even more deeply into the reality of the God in whom I have lived and moved and had my being.\\" Amen to that, but it does not require a church.over.\\" Again, where is God?

Franken through humor and wit, takes the rants and statements of record and proves them to be lies.  He goes so far as to phone people quoted in Coulters book, something she should have done.  He exposes the personalities of the Fox bunch including Colmes who I suspect is paid to be a straight man for Hannity.  Small wonder Fox tried to keep the book off the market.  The one common denominator the right wingers all have is anger.  I heard someone say anger covers fear.  My question is what are they all afraid of?  The truth??  Not only are they all angry, they are mean, nasty, hypocritical, selfish, and self serving.  And they can't take criticism.  They can dish it out but what whiners they are when it comes back.  They can't debate or discuss either.  Try to get Coulter to answer a question and she gives you sarcasm, maybe that's why she is not on t.v. as much and is now giving speeches to boy scout rallies.  If Frankens book is not truthful...let the whiners prove it.  His exposure of the chicken hawks is priceless, and explaining the war was won with the Clinton military is something no one else would attest to, except Cheney.  The horse and the drone was paid for by the last administration...indisputable facts.  Thanks Al, it felt good to laugh again.	2003-10-05

The material was so disturbing, that I wanted to be absolutely sure the author was leading me down a sincere path before I make an informed critique.<br /><br />I had  not read any of Grace Halsell's prior 14 books such as \\"Soul Sister\\",  \\"In Their Shoes\\",  or \\"Prophecy and Politics\\".  Nor did I know she served in the White House for 3 years under President Johnson as speechwriter, as well as journalist in the U.S., South America, Europe,  Middle East and more and is listed in Who's Who in America.<br />\\"Forcing God's Hand\\" focuses on the fastest growing segment of  'alternate' Christianity occurring in the USA today...  fundamental Dispensationalist Christianity, whose numbers now stand near 50 million.<br />Believing in the relatively new 'Rapture' theory born in the 1800's, and perpetuated by the teachings of Cyrus Scofield throughout the United States, the followers of this doctrine look forward to, but most importantly, are trying to hasten the coming of the 'end times' so that they will be spared the age of Tribulation and ascend to Heaven.<br />I should point out that the author clearly states that not all fundamentalists or dispensationalists subscribe to this theological ideology, but being raised a fundamentalist herself, and, after travelling on two Jerry Falwell sponsored tours to Israel, along with countless conversations with various pastors, she became aware of the distinct chasm between her churches theological teachings and that of today's 'mega' churches led by evangelical preachers such as the former leader of the Christian Coalition  Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, as well as Hal Lindsay who broadcasts daily on TBN to million of listeners and who openly demonizes Islam.<br /> \\"Forcing God's Hand\\" is not an impartial critique. Ms Halsell definitely had an agenda in mind here. To reveal to you how these evangelist leaders have severely 'politicized' their churches, turning their faithful worshipers into a sort of mobilized 'army' who are ready to confront domestic issues and most importantly, foreign policy concerning Israel, to insure that their version of the biblical prophecy of 'Armageddon' is fulfilled.<br />There are also thousands of smaller independent Dispensationalist churches, some with even more extreme views such as Concerned Christians who in 1999 were arrested in Israel for conspiring to commit violent acts in Jerusalem in order to hasten the return of Jesus Christ. This is just a small example of the many churches who have made a cult out of Christianity and Israel.<br />Despite the non-violent teachings of Jesus, and the promise of salvation for all, in this form of hijacked Christianity, there is no room in God's Kingdom for followers of Lutheran, Jewish, Islam, and Buddhist faiths, nor for any other 'non-believers' unless they convert to Christianity.<br />Also disturbing is that there are people in our government right now, that subscribe to this doctrine and actively praise the efforts of large lobbying groups such as the Christian Coalition and ZOA who strongly voice their opposition to a peaceful two state solution in the Middle East, and urge the moving the US Embassy to a united Jerusalem, an act which would most likely outrage about a billion Muslims worldwide.<br />The author's writing style is neither scholarly nor academic, but has a simplistic quality to it that even beginners will be able to understand. Considering that Grace Halsell died shortly after this publication, one has to wonder if she really had time to fully critique or opted to just cut to the chase. She however drops lots of names, and countless quotes that are easily verified. I myself found many audio clips and articles supporting her writing.<br />In today's circle of discussions regarding the rise of fundamentalism in other religions, one can see that Christianity is not immune. If you are concerned about a racist type of Christianity that's on the rise today, one that does not believe in separation of church and state and is actively trying to convert this nation from a Democracy to a 'Theocracy' then you should read this book.d about a racist type of Christianity that's on the rise today, one that does not believe in separation of church and state and is actively trying to convert this nation from a Democracy to a 'Theocracy' then you should read this book.	2003-10-03

Most people in America think that the media is to the left because most Americans have moderate or conservative viewpoints.  The leftist liberal fringe think the media is conservative because it's to the right of them.  Of course 99% of America including Bill and Hillary Clinton is to the right of the leftist liberal fringe which includes Eric Alterman.  The media is to the left, it's just not as far left as the leftist liberal fringe is.  <br />Even the ESTEEMED Walter Cronkite said that we have a liberal media in a recent interview.

His footnotes and documentation don't stand up under scrutiny.<br />This book along with other liberal writings practice the policy of cross polination concerning documenation.  Theidea of cross polination is that one liberal writer writes a book with questionable documentation and sources and then another liberal writer references the questionable book written by the other writer as being truthful and accurate.

Niffenegger's spin is just a little too original; I know I'm in the minority, but I found it extremely difficult to feel any identification or empathy with Henry and Clare.  Their emotions were just too forced, too dishonest for me.  Even Alba seemed dishonest.<br />I usually can't agree when someone says a book is &quot;contrived&quot; because all fiction, by its very nature, is contrived.  I found &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; to be so dishonest.  The characters said and did things that would be fine if the book was campy comedy or straight science fiction, but it is neither.  It's fiction with a bizarre twist and I found comedy to be entirely absent from this book.<br />&quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; is quite tragic but it was a tragedy for which I had no sympathy because it was, I think, dishonest.  Real people, in Henry and Clare's situation (if they could be in that situation) simply wouldn't react the way these two fictional people did.  Too much tragedy and pain kills love and makes it impossible to remain together.  Henry and Clare's love, while believable in the beginning, grew increasingly unbelievable as the story progressed.  The scene with Clare in Gomez's kitchen, near the end of the book simply verified the dishonesty of Clare's emotions to me.<br />Even had I liked this book I would have been put off by all the foul language.  I'm certainly not a prude, but that doesn't mean I enjoy reading gutter language.  I don't and Niffenegger surely must know that most people don't use it, even in private.  At least not as often as Henry and especially, Clare, did.<br />The book was also overly long and very, very slow to start.  Henry and Clare &quot;meet,&quot; then Niffenegger goes into a backstory longer than some novels.  Henry and Clare's wedding doesn't occur until the book's midpoint.<br />Originality is a quality highly prized in any writer of fiction, but when originality drifts into the bizarre, the reader identification is usually lost.<br />Ms. Niffenegger writes a smooth narrative and good dialogue (except the crude parts) but I think she needs to work on structure.  This book meanders far too often and Niffenegger has a tendency to ramble.  The book was simply &quot;they did this and then they did that.&quot;  Niffenegger loses touch with her story far too often.  The book was too boring, too repetitive and way too dishonest.

US	52942881	R342GN8EU9ECRQ	1559706643	918070082	Black Dahlia Avenger	Books	5	12	19	N	N	Couldn't Put It Down	Okay, the Black Dahlia murder was committed over 50 years ago. Obviously, the principals of the murder and investigation are now either very old or passed away. This leaves Steve Hodel (an ex-LAPD detective) with some physical evidence, and a lot of circumstantial evidence, which he uncovers and ties together very well to make the case that his father, George Hodel, not only killed Elizabeth Short, but was a serial killer responsible, at least in part (he may have had an accomplice), for several other murders of young women in the Los Angeles area in the 1940s.<br />What the other reviews here miss, however, is the fascinating look inside the culture of the 1920s-1940s LAPD, underworld, and art and film industries. Set in the context that Steve Hodel presents of that era, it's very easy to see why the Dahlia murder (and the others) were never officially solved. As I read the book, I found myself transported back in time, to a very different era where power, influence, and political connectedness, all of which George Hodel had an abundance of, were the currency of the day. Very frightening, and a great job of detective work by Steve to untangle it all.<br />Where does that leave the actual investigation? Right where it was before Steve wrote this book. Nowhere. But let's look at the points Steve proves. A) His father knew The Black Dahlia (Elizabeth Short) B) His father's handprinting (verified by an expert) matched the printing on the body and in several letters sent to the authorities by the killer C) The killer was a surgeon, as was his father D) The killer was a serial killer, of which little was known in the 1940s E) Most importantly, THE KILLINGS STOPPED when George Hodel left the country in 1950, amid the heat of a pending DA investigation.<br />Other reviews have disparaged this book, but for me this is a great piece of detective work layed out in a fashion that we can all follow and understand. I think Steve Hodel makes his case, I think the book is a greatread, and I hope you think so too.	2003-09-23

Those who hate this book simply hate hearing the truth; when you build your thinking around lies, it's very unpleasant to have the rug pulled out from under you. Unfortunately, instead of doing the smart thing by joining in the criticism of the hacks on the right who have destroyed true political discourse, these misguided folks choose to perpetuate their irrational bile. I've never had a problem having a good argument with a thoughtful, intelligent conservative.

Faith should be, as Soren Kierkegaard envisioned it, a purely irrational leap.<br />The restriction on the length of my review of this book (imposed by<BR>Amazon.com at a 1,000 words) does not allow me to delineate all the positive particulars this book has to offer. Regrettably, I can only emphasize what aspects of this book distinguish it from other works of a similar nature.<br />One of the most attractive features that I found in Smith's book was his ability to convey complex philosophical dilemmas, that are germane to the realm of theism, without falling into the common practice - which most professional philosophers constantly do - of inundating his arguments with esoteric jargon. Any laymen can peruse through Smith's work without having to open a philosophical dictionary every five minutes. While Smith does put forth his charges against religious belief in a manner that is fairly easy to grasp, he does not sacrifice substantive content, therefore an individual who is more seasoned in the subject of philosophy and theology will not find &quot;Atheism: The Case Against God&quot; lacking by any means.  This ability to reach both the philosophical hobbyist and the academician speaks much of Smith's talent as a writer as it does of him as a philosopher.<br />Outside this book's easily discernable assertions, another noteworthy characteristic of Smith's piece is its originality. In reading other works relating to non-theistic argumentation, I began to see the same routine of arguing for atheism, which consisted of providing a summation of a particular theistic argument, and then find certain fallacies or misrepresentations that the argument may have. Whether the argument happened to be cosmological, teleological, ontological, or moralistic the same technique was employed to engage all of them. Though this is a very effective means of addressing an argument, it is one that has been used ad nauseam. So for an individual who has been exposed to a great deal of such kinds of work, it is refreshing to see this more innovative approach to the whole theistic/atheistic controversy.<br />If one had to describe Smith's approach in one word that word would have to be &quot;fundamental&quot;. As stated earlier, other philosophical works that address the theistic position get bogged down in the various details of theistic argumentation, without striking at the root or presupposition that such arguments are built on. Smith's technique on the other hand address what is at the heart of these arguments.<br />What is at the root of most theistic arguments for the belief in a <BR>God? According to Smith this is not the proper question to ask. The proper question to ask is what is presupposition of any argument period. The answer to this question is the ability to decipher truth from falsehood.<br />Yet verification, as Smith so deftly explains to his audience, rests on the use of certain standards, which gauge the reality of any given proposition. Since we exist within a universe our standards must be derived from our perception of the universe. Given this idea, if anything is posited, which exists outside the universe (i.e. God or any form of supernatural entity), the argument is futile. In fact, as Mr. Smith rightly claims, it is not an argument at all. The universe, in the words of Ayn Rand are the &quot;causal primary&quot;. One cannot talk about causation (i.e. cosmological arguments), design (i.e. teleological arguments), or moralistic arguments unless one is speaking within a proper context, which in this case is the universe itself. To do otherwise is to regress into a state of incoherence. For example, it is ultimately absurd to talk about a cause to the universe, if we derive the concept of cause from our observation of the universe. To talk about a concept, such as causal relationships, outside the context from which the concept was realized (i.e. the universe) is to divorce it from its context. Thus the theist has rendered his argument ineffective. To paraphrase Mr. Smith &quot;to talk about a cause to the universe is like talking about a bird's flight with no atmosphere.&quot;  In one crushing argumentative blow after another, with the physical universe as a necessary axiom, Mr. Smith annihilates most of traditional theistic rhetoric, without even delving into the individual fallacies, which are inherent in all of them. Only two words are necessary to describe his approach - &quot;SHEER BRILLIANCE!!!&quot;  The theist is left with very few options. He either can retract all his assertions and admit that there is no rational basis for the belief in God or he can attack the very foundation of reason (the physical universe) - thus precluding his right to employ argument.  Either way, George Smith backs the Christian apologist and proponents of the supernatural into such a tight corner, that it is virtually impossible for them to escape<br />A theist, who has read other critiques on theism and agrees with them, may believe that he has some recourse in faith. However Mr. Smith has addressed this issue and shown it as an invalid method for attaining the truth. Clearly Mr. Smith in his book &quot;Atheism: The Case Against God&quot; leaves theists with no options. He has shown theism, and especially the Christian manifestation of it, for what it truly is - a worldview rife with misology.  Mr. Smith undermines the old Christian adage that all truth can be found if one believes in God, and instead edifies David's Brooks position that &quot;to explain the unknown by the known is logical procedure, but to explain the known by the unknown is a form of theological lunacy.&quot; This book is a must read for anyone pondering the claims of theism seriously.	2003-09-23

You can't expect someone like Arthur Schlesinger to come anywhere near the truth. Here is the truth that Arthur Schlesinger doesn't want you to know.<br />The fact is that the Communist Chinese threatened to intervene if the U.N. troops pushed passed the 38th parallel, not up to the Yalu river. It was Truman's orders to push to the Yalu river or until the North Koreans surrendered, whichever came first. <br />It was Truman's error not to allow Gen. MacArthur to bomb the Yalu bridges thereby insuring that the Chinese could not cross over into the Korean peninsula in any substantial numbers. Intelligence documents released a few years ago identified why the Chinese were so confident about their involvement in the war. The Soviet Union used spies in the U.S. government to determine whether Truman would allow MacArthur to press a campaign against China if they were to enter the war. These are the same traitors that Senator Joseph McCarthy railed against later in his committee investigations. The Venona documents verified the validity of these espionage activities and this was all happening right under the nose of President Truman.<br />The information that the Soviets culled from their American traitors and spies was subsequently passed on to the Communist Chinese. General Lin Piao, the commander of the Chinese troops who poured across the Yalu bridges into Korea, was able to boast in a leaflet distributed in China, \\"l would never have made the attack and risked my men and military reputation if I had not been assured that Washington would restrain General MacArthur from taking adequate retaliatory measures against my lines of supply and communication.\\"<br />The Chinese then attacked the U.N. troops, comfortable in the knowledge that Truman would do nothing more than fight a defensive war.<br />After the war had ended, the U.S. Congress investigated. General Mark Clark told the committee empanelled to review what had happened: \\"I was not allowed to bomb the numerous bridges across the Yalu River over which the enemy constantly poured his trucks and his munitions, and his killers.\\" General James Van Fleet said: \\"My own conviction is that there must have been information to the enemy from high diplomatic authorities that we would not attack his home bases across the Yalu.\\" Air Force General George Stratemeyer added: \\"You get in war to win it. You do not get in war to stand still and lose it, and we were required to lose it. We were not permitted to win.\\" And General MacArthur then summarized: \\"Such a limitation upon the utilization of available military force to repel an enemy attack has no precedent, either in our own history, or so far as I know, in the history of the world.\\"<br />At this point in the war, however, hordes of Chinese communist troops stormed across the Yalu River from Manchuria, and the war began again in earnest. MacArthur was denied permission to destroy the bridges over the river across which poured men and supplies destined for use against his men. He protested to no avail and was soon relieved of command by President Harry Truman, whom the Chicago Tribune stated at the time wasn't worthy to shine the general's shoes.<BR>Command of the U.S./ROK forces was turned over to General Matthew Ridgway. He immediately altered the method of fighting. In his own book, The Korean War, Ridgway stated that his first task on assuming MacArthur's command was \\"to place reasonable restrictions on the Eighth [U.S. Army] and ROK Armies' advance.\\" Then he drafted detailed orders to field commanders containing such passages as, \\"You will direct the efforts of your forces toward inflicting maximum personnel casualties and material losses on hostile forces in Korea .... Acquisition of terrain of itself is of little or no value.\\"<br />Classic military strategy includes the taking and holding of terrain until so much of it has been acquired that the adversary is forced to sue for peace. Butthis was no longer allowable strategy in Korea. Even worse, our men were told that killing was to be their main goal. A morally sound military principle holds that removing an enemy's capability to impose his will should be the goal -- and killing him is not always necessary. Which is precisely what MacArthur had demonstrated with the successful landing at Inchon.<br />Eventually the war in Korea degenerated to two years of fighting over relatively inconsequential hills near the 38th parallel. Bitter hard-fought battles would be waged by our troops to take a particular objective. Then, after success had been achieved with plenty of casualties on both sides, orders from on high would require them to abandon the terrain they had just won.<br />From the victory that had been gained after Inchon, our forces were required eventually to settle for a stalemate.<br />If Truman had let MacArthur bomb the Yalu bridges that would have stopped the Chinese from coming into Korea, we wouldn't be facing this mess. And, China could have been freed from communism if we had let the 500,000 men Taiwan had offered us to fight the North Koreans and the Chinese. This all goes back to the communists that were in the Truman administration that influenced Truman into stripping the Chinese Nationalists of their weapons and forcing them out of the Chinese mainland in the first place.<br />So, yes, Truman is responsible for losing China to communism. Arthur Schlesinger doesn't any won't tell you this. Don't bother with this tripe.	2003-09-21
US	26395563	RVUXSU675RP02	0932813909	987521630	Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers	Books	1	57	88	N	N	Dumb and Dumberer	As a student of history, I find the suggestion that the Apollo moon landings were faked, as one of the most asinine ideas that has come around in a long time.  NASA programs in general, and the Apollo program in particular are unsurpassed in their documentation, and openness.  Thousands of photographs were taken on the surface of the moon, thousands more in orbit and ten of thousands more were taken on the Earth documenting everything from vehicle assembly, crew training, mission control, the \\"average\\" NASA engineer, testing, simulations and countless more.  This visual documentation is nothing compared to millions of pages of technical documentation related to the moon landings.  Additionally, thousands of scientific papers have been written about the scientific data returned by the Apollo missions.  Lastly, tens of thousands of non-government and foreign reporters, journalists and photographers covered this event and no stories have ever appeared about a hoax.<br />Since I am not a technical person, I approached the hypothesis of the book from a different perspective.  Are their facts correct?  And do their arguments make sense?  Typical questions asked by historical researchers.  The answer to both of these questions is \\"NO\\"  In some cases, they've actually lied to the reader and hidden the facts from the reader.<br />First of all, do their arguments make sense?  No, they do not.  It is inconceivable that the hundreds and thousands of engineers and scientists who worked on the project could keep silent about their government creating a moon hoax.  That would imply that all these people were morally bankrupt, plus the people around the world, such as Australia and Spain, who provided technical support were also morally bankrupt.  I'm sorry, I just can't believe that guilt wouldn't cause at least one person to come forward.  What about the enemies of the United States?  Why would they go along with this hoax?  Again, it doesn't make sense.<br />Second, are their facts correct?  Again, the answer is No.  Here I'll give some specific examples.  On pages 319 - 321, there is a story of an Australian women named Una Ronald who stayed up late to watch the Apollo 11 moon landing and said she saw a Coke bottle roll across the lunar surface and that the next day there were letters in her local newspaper that confirmed her story.  The problem with this story is that it was nighttime in the United States and daytime in Australia when the moon landings occurred.  Ask any US citizen over 45 and they will probably tell you that they stayed up late to watch the moon landings.  Of course this can be easily verified by numerous space websites.  The second problem with this story is that it doesn't make sense.  It was estimated that a billion people watched the Apollo 11 moon landings live and only Una Roland saw a Coke bottle.  This implies that somehow only Una Ronald could see a Coke bottle, during a time warp I guess, and the rest of the world is blind.<br />By far the most flagrant deceptions occur in the author's discussions about photographs.  They make some incorrect statements that light from the sun should produce parallel shadows.  First, sunlight from the sun does not travel in parallel rays, it expands slightly.  Second, as any art or photography student knows and I suspect most people know as well, objects and their shadows vanish to a point.  This is known as perspective.  If you didn't see this in the NASA photographs, then you'd know it was fake.<br />To emphasis this flawed point, on page 22, the authors show two photographs of some scenery with several trees and their shadows in each photograph.  The authors superimpose two parallel lines on each of the these photographs; however, when I draw a straight line on the shadows cast by the trees, they were not parallel, as they should be.  The author's lines are only there to deceive the reader and not allow the reader to draw their own conclusion.<br />Another example of the author's deceptive ways occur on the next page, page 23.  Here, there is a black and white photograph taken on the moon that shows an astronaut and the moon lander in the background and some rocks in the foreground.  The authors again draw some lines to try and convince the reader that NASA is pulling off a hoax.  For this case, they use a poor quality black and white photograph instead of the original color photograph.  Going to a NASA site and reviewing a high resolution color scan, it is clear that the shadows indeed fall the way they should to a vanishing point and that missing shadows from several rocks and the astronaut appear.<br />From my perspective as a history major, these people are neither researchers, investigative reporters nor whatever they choose to call themselves, but the new snake-oil salesmen of our age.hor's deceptive ways occur on the next page, page 23.

The allegations about the Catholic Church aren't shocking to anyone who's read _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_, or the better follow-up _The Woman with the Alabaster Jar_; what *is* shocking is that Brown presents this interesting if flawed speculative history as if it were verified fact.  There's enough actual evidence of the Church's ugly political machinations and lethal intolerance and misogyny to power any number of thrillers without having to resort to invention, but I digress.  Brown seeds the story with just enough facts that the half-truths, misleading statements, and pure fictions go down in the same gulp, and while that's certainly no crime -- this is a suspense novel, after all -- he then tries to endow it all with the odor of historical sanctity, but there's another aroma overpowering.<br />As for the story itself... eh. It clipped along at a decent pace, but again, knowing the conspiracy theory in advance rendered the plot utterly predictable.  Then there's Brown's gifts as a prose stylist, which are, to be charitable, crushingly mediocre.  But by far the most irritating aspect of the book, for me, was Brown's treatment of Sophie.  After a promising entrance (springing Langdon from a trap in the Louvre), she becomes no more than a listening post and token love interest.  The scenes where she sits around, silent, while a bunch of *men* lecture her about The Suppression of the Divine Feminine were unintentionally hilarious.  In fact, were there any other women in this novel?  Liberate the Mother, indeed.	2003-09-18

He attempts to cover the whole arena, from the complex behavior of quarks and gluons to the description of particle detectors. Woven throughout the book are small &quot;vignettes&quot; (his terminology for brief biographical sketches) of the many physicists, famous and not-so-famous, who contributed to the current understanding of our universe. He succeeds relatively well in his goal of explaining particle physics to the layman.<br />But don't look here for any coverage of the more esoteric and exotic ideas of theoretical physics like string theory. He unequivocally states,<br />&quot;The fact is that this book is about physics, and this implies  that the theoretical ideas discussed must be supported by  experimental facts. Neither supersymmetry nor string theory  satisfy this criterion. They are figments of the theoretical  mind. To quote Pauli: They are not even wrong. They have no  place here.&quot;<br />He is, of course, correct but I think he downplays the mathematically unifying power of string theory, for which experimental verification lies beyond today's technological reach and thus cannot be vindicated one way or the other. Mathematical beauty, while not a sure sign of physical truth, can at least serve as a powerful beacon for future physical insights.<br />Always the true scientist, Veltman should be praised for unapologetically declaring agnosticism if evidence for a theoretical idea isn't clear cut. For example, he writes several times that the neutrino is massless but will almost always parenthetically acknowledge that it might have a very small mass (which indeed it does, as experimental evidence of neutrino mixing has been since verified). He deems it worthy enough to have an entire section devoted to neutrino mixing and its implications.<br />I found one glaring problem with the book that prevented the 5 star rating it could have received: writing style. It just doesn't read all that smoothly, and I think it could have been cleaned up a bit more by a more astute editor.<br />Balancing the rocky prose, however, are wonderful color templates (excellently used during his description of anti-matter) to aid explanations, pictures of apparati and scientists to portray the human side of science, and clear diagrams of particle interactions.<br />If you want to learn what physicists empirically know about particle physics today and how they determine it, get this book; just don't expect smooth reading. Veltman is clearly passionate about his profession and it shows.	2003-09-15

This makes it possible for conservatives to annotate patent falsehoods and give them an air of \\"authority\\", based on the belief of dittoheads and other smooth-lobed bipeds that anything so annotated must be verified.  Attend, for instance, Al Franken's ability to easily expose the convoluted, mawkish errors in a Reagan fiscal chart published by Sean Hannity, who knows Eleven Things. P.T.

As the glazed-eyed, gape-mouthed Limbaugh fans log in en masse to pan a book they refuse to buy or read, they will not refute a single point Franken makes, but will resort to pathos-filled rhetoric and supersimplified dismissals.

Ricardo's gentleness and sincerity reflected in his various movies and television shows seemed to be verified in the book.  So is his serious side.  He writes the book with great honesty, at times making fun of himself and his relationship with his wife and children.  At moments I cried along with him, but more so I laughed along with him.  I walked away with the feeling that when I closed the book, I knew the total man, but a question remained. Why did Ricardo not call it \\"Reflections:  A Life in Many Worlds\\"?  He seemed to have gone through many and conquered each to grow into the fantastic man one could only admire.   Throughout the book, he showed great interest in his fellow man, no matter if it is a fellow actor or a person he just met.  The book made me reflect on my own life and the many worlds I had to go through and adapt to.  I will try to get a second book, if possible, to make it a Christmas gift to a friend of mine who has lived in the two worlds Ricardo Montalban so sincerely describes.	2003-09-10

As a non-medical lay person, my impression in reading the book was that the title is a bit inadequate.  While the straightforward, lucid style in which facts and ideas are presented makes the book's inflammation related advice accessable in a pragmatic fashion, Meggs seems to cover so much territory with his recommendations that this work could almost be understood as a broad guidebook for living a healthy and happy life in general, albeit with inflammation as the book's raison d'etre.<br />Certainly I have wondered how and why various drugs functioned in my body, and I have learned a great deal on that subject here.  The same can be said about foods, moods, and the air we breathe; it all gets clearly mentioned.  Looking at the back portion of the book reveals the depth of research that went into the writing of it, and Dr. Meggs has not speculated with much of what he says - it's all backed up with facts that can be verified.<br />I enjoyed the book (it's a fun and easy read) and I highly recommend it.  I was left with the impression that I was reading solid medical advice, not romantic fantasy.  Buy this book.	2003-09-02

The case, the murder of a seemingly upstanding pillar of the community by his spurned long-time mistress [the victim had recently dumped her for a younger mistress], has all the elements of a classic crime of passion. Faulconer's choppy writing style and an excess of trivia are the main elements that torpedoed this book for me. <br />Mr. Faulconer deserves high marks for his research and fact-checking. He states in the Preface that he's read too many true crime books that contain fictional characters and/or dialogue and that everything in his work is factually verified and verifiable.  That is an outstanding premise for a true crime work. He answers the typical questions myself and most true crime readers have at the end of a book: What happened to the defendant in jail? How much of their sentence did they serve? What happened to the main players in the book after the trial?<br />Unfortunately, the book bogs down by the third chapter when he digresses into a history of his father's career [his father was the judge who was assigned this sensational case as his first outing on the bench!], and takes frequent sidebars into Indianapolis and state politics. There is also too much unneeded information about people in this book and life in Indianapolis in general. Some of this was necessary, but it should have been condensed.  <br />Faulconer's writing style also wore on me as I read. He writes in simple sentences and mostly short, three or four sentence paragraphs and this became tedious to read. He also repeatedly informs the reader that society, social mores, and technology were different in the late 1950s than they are now. I  was impressed by Judge Faulconer's hard-thought decision to allow cameras in the courtroom [very progressive for 1958] to tape the trial and a selection of letters sent to the Judge during the trial was interesting. The few good things about this book could not outweigh the bad.	2003-08-27

I must say, it is a very riveting novel. As a Catholic, however, I noticed that the book did have a decidedly anti-Catholic slant. By this I do not mean that Dan Brown bashed Catholics. I mean that some important things that were said about the Church were, perhaps, not as well-researched as they could have been. <br />THE DA VINCI CODE is, of course, a work of fiction. And, as such, it was enjoyable. Many people will learn quite a bit from this novel. Unfortunately, many people unfamiliar with authentic Catholicism may get a very negative impression of the Church since they might assume that all of the historical references are accurate and meticulously verified. After reading this book, I have come to conclude that this is simply not the case. Which is unfortunate because the book is a runaway bestseller and many will assume that its references to the Church are all accurate. <br />Brown's novel seems to have many historical inaccuracies. One example of this is found on page 233 of the book. A character named Sir Leigh Teabing, who is a Grail authority, is discussing the history of the Grail. He is speaking with two other characters in the story -- Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Teabing tells them that the belief in the divinity of Jesus was something that the Council of Nicaea, in effect, made up in 325 AD. Leigh Teabing says to Sophie Neveu, \\"My dear, until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by His followers as a mortal prophet...a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless. A mortal.\\" Sophie Neveu then asks, \\"Not the Son of God?\\" Teabing then responds, \\"Right. Jesus' establishment as 'the Son of God' was officially proposed and voted on by the Council of Nicaea.\\" <br />The fact is that up until the Council of Nicaea, there were a variety of opinions as to the nature of Jesus Christ. The idea of Jesus being human and divine was very difficult for people to fathom back then. And it is still difficult to comprehend today. Some pre-Nicene Christians believed that Jesus was God, but not really a true human being. One of the big reasons that Gnosticism was ruled a heresy by the Nicene Council was ostensibly because they believed Jesus to be divine but not human. Conversely, another group known as Arians were also branded as heretics ostensibly because they believed Jesus to be a human but not God. All Christians, however, believed Jesus to be the Son of God in whatever way they may have understood this at the time. To imply, as I think Dan Brown does, that the Council of Nicaea proposed this new concept of Jesus' divinity in 325 AD is a misleading oversimplification at best. <br />The assertion in this book that Christians did not view Jesus as the divine Son of God until the Council of Nicaea is factually incorrect. Yes, there were diverse opinions about Jesus' nature in the early church. And some Christians did not understand Jesus to be God per se. But, the majority of the Christians did not view Jesus as simply a mortal prophet. And Mary Magdalene certainly viewed Jesus as divine. We see this in both the New Testament and the Nag Hammadi Library. <br />What Dan Brown's character goes on to say about the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi Library can also be very misleading. He says the following: <br />***Fortunately for historians, some of the gospels that Constantine attempted to eradicate managed to survive. The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in the 1950s (sic) hidden in a cave near Qumran in the Judean desert. And, of course, the Coptic Scrolls (sic) in 1945 at Nag Hammadi. In addition to telling the true Grail story, these documents speak of Christ's ministry in very human terms. <BR>(THE DA VINCI CODE, page 234).*** <br />The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947 (not the 1950s). They do not mention Jesus Christ at all. And they were hidden in those caves c. 70 AD, some 250 years before the Council of Nicaea for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do withthe as yet unborn Emperor Constantine at all. <br />The Nag Hammadi texts are incorrectly called \\"scrolls\\" in this book. They were, in fact, codices. And they do not mention anything about Jesus and Mary Magdalene having children, being married, or having a sexual relationship at all. Mary Magdalene is referred to as the disciple whom Jesus loved and as the \\"companion\\" of Jesus. And, granted, some have translated the Coptic word as \\"consort\\" rather than \\"companion.\\" But I think its a leap to say that these documents tell \\"the true Grail story\\" based on this. Furthermore, since the Nag Hammadi texts were probably compiled by Gnostics, in them a great emphasis is placed on the divine Risen Jesus who is alive and revealing his divine glory to a select group of people, particularly Mary Magdalene. I would hardly call the image of Jesus in the Nag Hammadi texts as that of a mortal prophet. <br />Normally, nitpicking about the accuracy of statements of fact in a novel would be a bit much. After all, an author is entitled to a certain amount of creative license. However, I comment on these historical innaccuracies in light of Dan Brown's own statement on the first page preceding his Prologue. Under the heading \\"Facts\\" he writes: \\"All description of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\" Clearly, some of them, as pointed out here, are not. <br />On the whole, however, the book was very interesting. I think many people will learn alot of interesting things about the Quest for the Grail, the Templars, Leonardo da Vinci, the secret societies...etc. I was disappointed with the way the book seems to paint the Catholic Church in a negative light with broad brushstrokes. Dan Brown should have made more of an effort to be more historically accurate. I, for one, am not an authority on the Grail history. And I think I learned a lot about it by reading this novel. But, after seeing the way the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi Library, and the Council of Nicaea were discussed in this book, I now feel the need to double check all of the purported facts outlined in this novel.	2003-08-24

Anyone who doubts the Bible, or the documentation is completely ignoring the evidence.  If Jesus did not rise from the dead, then show the body!  The whole matter comes to one thing.  Those who refuse to accept the fact that the Bible is true do not want to come to this conclusion because once faced with the facts, there must be a decision to either accept it and change, or ignore it and die in sin, or be in the Tribulation.  I know many will tell me to prove the Bible.  I have a question for you though.  Can you, with all seriousness, tell me what you will say to Jesus when you stand before Him if it is true??  I can definitely tell you this, you better really KNOW that you are right, as you will have a great dissappointment if you are wrong.  Many of the so-called contradictions are posted to try to disprove the Bible.  However, they are all taken out of context, as well as completely dismiss how scriptures were written.  I challenge anyone.  Prove that Jesus didn't rise from the dead.  Should be pretty easy, since he would have to be buried somewhere in Israel.  His location of burial can be verified by other places other than the Bible as well.  Face the facts.  Jesus did rise from the dead and there is NO PROOF to say otherwise.	2003-08-23

Jaspers' book generally reflects the more modern scholarship that has focused increasingly on certain parallel sayings in Matthew and Luke as &quot;Q Gospel&quot; remnants and on the earliest Vaticanus and Sinaiticus manuscripts of the earliest extant Gospel, Mark.  Yet recent similarly focused studies on the other three paradigmatic figures covered here don't seem reflected in Jaspers' book to the same extent.  Personally, I am not as disturbed as the previous reviewer may be by applying modern scholarship to the Gospels.  Rather, what I miss is the same strictness applied to the other three written traditions.  Confucius, for example, is eventually described as having held high office only when we get to relatively late texts in the Confucian tradition.  Yet Jaspers accepts this description of him without question.  In fact, if, as Jaspers does by inference in his Jesus chapter, we are to set some of what we read in the Gospel of John aside, then oughtn't we set aside similar texts describing Confucius as having had conspicuous political success?  If the &quot;Q Gospel&quot; passages in Matthew/Luke and the earliest manuscript tradition for Mark are to be highlighted as delineations of the &quot;historical Jesus&quot;, then only Chapters 3 through 9 of the Analects of Confucius, generally regarded as the earliest stratum of Confucian text, should be the primary basis for the kind of modern philosophical scrutiny Jaspers purports to offer.  Jaspers' Confucius chapter does not confine itself to the kind of wandering, almost homeless, figure found in these seven earliest chapters.  To be consistent, shouldn't it?  While it's useful for Jaspers, at the outset of his Buddha chapter, to single out the Digha-Nikaya collection as the earliest stratum of Buddha sermons, the rest of the Buddha chapter goes well beyond the Digha-Nikaya collection, even flirting occasionally with Buddha traditions lying outside the Pali tradition, let alone the Digha-Nikaya collection!  There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but it becomes inconsistent in the light of Jaspers' tacit adoption of certain tenets of modern historical criticism in his Jesus chapter.  (To do Jaspers justice, he never explicitly offers quite the detailed textual background on the Gospel tradition that I attempt here.)  What, IMO, might prove a more creditable effort -- since I would agree that these four figures indeed emerge as the most strongly verified human beings in history to live an essentially blameless life oriented toward an entirely self-made, and therefore inherently courageous, ethic -- would be a survey based exclusively on those fifteen or so sermons in the Digha-Nikaya regarded by modern scholars as the earliest for Buddha, on Chapters 3 through 9 of the Analects for Confucius, on the earliest, least &quot;spun&quot;, Plato dialogues, such as the Charmides, the Hippias Minor, the Euthyphro, the Apology and the Crito, for Socrates, and on the Vaticanus/Sinaiticus Mark tradition plus the &quot;Q&quot; passages in Matthew/Luke for Jesus.  It is unfortunate that Jaspers' book, with all its modern trappings (not in itself a bad thing, IMO), fails to do this rigorously.  Hence, my three-star rating.  Jaspers should be given credit, though, for a worthwhile start at the important task of evaluating perhaps the four finest human beings ever to walk this earth.lection, even flirting occasionally with Buddha traditions lying outside the Pali tradition, let alone the Digha-Nikaya collection!  There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but it becomes inconsistent in the light of Jaspers' tacit adoption of certain tenets of modern historical criticism in his Jesus chapter.  (To do Jaspers justice, he never explicitly offers quite the detailed textual background on the Gospel tradition that I attempt here.)

US	27702773	R2WBKEVDAF6C50	0684863316	419002241	Alexander Hamilton, American	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Not the best biography on Hamilton	I put the book down when I read what Mr. Brookehiser wrote about Alexander's father James, that he was a ne'er do well.  I have visited Nevis, where Alexander was born and may be directly descended from Alexander Hamilton, Laird of the Grange, Scotland, Alexander's namesake and grandfather.  I suggest to Mr. Brookehiser that he read Vincent Hubbard's book about the history of Nevis.  The sugar cane business underwent boom and bust periods whose profits were intimately linked to supporting the war machines of individual european nations. (Nevis's income supported Great Britain's forces, in particular, its navy).  James Hamilton's lack of success economically may well not be a fault of his own.<br />One must be very careful in writing about Hamilton because in actuality, he was very much hated by Adams, Jefferson, and much that has been written about him historically is not accurate, because it was not accurate, strongly one-sided, at the time during which he lived.  I must say, that hatred of Hamilton continues today which spurred me to read more about him with an eye on finding reasons why my own family would be hated so much.<br />In fairness to Mr. Brookehiser, much is not known about James.  And for those who want tabloid type details on any of Americas's founding fathers and are disappointed that that information is not supplied by the biographers, they must understand the types of information that were available at the time (mostly letters in the eighteen century), that could shed more light upon the persons being studied. <br />I prefer Forrest McDonald's biography because it is written by a historian, someone who is a Professor, whose focus has been on early American history, and whose work is carefully researched.  His endnotes, revealing his source material, indicate how he consulted personal letters and even read all of Alexander's sources of information in order to try to understand how he thought.<br />I am wary of biographers with more experience in journalism writing historical biographies on people who lived before the twentieth century.  Mainly because, in the modern century, one can very easily reconstruct the context in which actions, decisions were done and made, and a source's validity is more quickly verified or not.  The problem, however, is that the journalist's story is better told and read by the public, and as such, will be the more popularized versions.<br />But, for that last statement of mine, I am very much a black sheep.  What is most important to me, is that the truth be told, even if it is not popular.  That, I believe is a Hamiltonian trait that Hamilton and I do share, and I must add, as a biologist by profession, that it is in both of our genes.<br />I am not impressed by the 500 glowing reviews of John Adams and his modern journalistic biographer, Mr. McCullough.<br />Better to have 10 or 20 commentaries on a well-researched, truthful, work of art than a 1000 on a sweet sounding, well-written, but false, piece of junk.  <br />A good read can be a bad book.<br />Please see my review dated 04/09/04.  I'm responsible for the contents and any problems/misunderstandings it may have generated.	2003-08-19

Upon accepting the offer to become Chief Investigative Counsel of the House Judiciary Committee, David Schippers assembled a professional, hard-working, and highly ethical team to prepare impeachment proceedings against Clinton. A lifelong Chicago Democrat who worked for Robert Kennedy and voted for Clinton in both presidential elections, he nonetheless became thoroughly disenchanted with the \\"lies, cowardice, hypocrisy, cynicism, amorality, butt-covering\\" among House Democrats and the Senate. <BR> <BR>The second American president to be impeached, Clinton claimed the vast right-wing conspiracy was circumventing the Constitution. In fact, the impeachment process was specifically designed by the Founding Fathers as part of our system of checks and balances, but the Senate leadership ensured its failure. Schippers wanted to follow the procedure used against President Nixon, but the likes of Senator Ted Stevens quickly clarified that this was no Watergate: \\"I don't care if you prove he raped a woman and shot her dead-- you are not going to get [the] votes.\\" On whether the Senators would ignore their oath \\"to do equal and impartial justice,\\" he replies: \\"You're damn right they are.\\" One Democratic Congressman overheard as saying \\"My God, this is indefensible. The man is a perjurer, a liar, he's obstructing justice. How can we defend him?\\" nonetheless voted against impeachment. Among the rare voices of integrity was Democrat Joe Lieberman. <BR> <BR>Schippers is a straight-talker and doesn't pull any punches. Countering noncooperation from Attorney-General Reno's Department of Justice, he promises an Obstruction of Congress charge. When Reno refused to supply reports from FBI Director Louis Freeh and DoJ prosecutor Charles LaBella, he plays severe hardball and eventually nearly succeeds. Tipped off that the White House is setting him up, and if he accepts the reports they will be immediately leaked, Schippers declines them-- Clinton wins. <BR> <BR>Contrary to received propaganda, Clinton's transgressions were not about sex. Even with all the stonewalling and intimidation, the Judiciary Committee gathered evidence to support 15 separate felonies, among which perjury, witness tampering, and suborning perjury. Because of constraints imposed on the inquiry, much was not even investigated: illegal foreign campaign contributions (Chinagate), illegal possession of secret FBI personnel files (Filegate), the firing and slandering of the travel office staff (Travelgate), selling of Commerce Department junkets for campaign contributions (Commercegate), and perjury over his tawdry adulterous affairs with Kathleen Willey, Dolly Kyle Browning, and Gennifer Flowers. <BR> <BR>Clinton's rape (as Arkansas Attorney-General) of Juanita Broaddrick is simply heinous. When he appeared to have finished, he told his victim \\"My God, I can do it again!\\" and did. She kept quiet, and at a later fundraiser Hillary approached her and said \\"I've heard so much about you [...]. We appreciate everything you do,\\" though she hadn't worked for their campaign. When Clinton's conquests were subpoenaed in the Paula Jones case, they were pressured into providing false depositions or threatened (sometimes grotesquely). <BR> <BR>The White House coerced the INS to grant citizenship to aliens likely to vote Democratic by waiving normal security checks. Accounting firm KPMG established that over 250,000 aliens with certain or unverified arrest records obtained citizenship, and in a sample of 100 aliens with serious prior criminal records 20% now had FBI arrest records for serious crimes committed after obtaining citizenship. <BR> <BR>The day before the debate and vote on the articles of impeachment, Clinton bombs Iraq.  <BR> <BR>Schippers reproduces some of the support and hate mail he received, and one poignant letter is worth quoting: \\"I am writing to you because my friend Eddie saw you on TV and said you were moral and tough. My Dad is a lot like the President because he likes to have ladies sleep over when my Mom's away. I don't like that. I was wondering if you could help impeach my Dad?\\"	2003-08-15

The truth is that 54 Arabs (mostly armed with machine guns and grenades) were killed along with 14 Israeli soldiers.<br />The editor cannot back up his claims of a massacre with victims names or any other relevant information.  This is something commonly seen in Palestinian society, the crying wolf syndrome, that caused the UN to scrap its investigation into the alleged massacre.<br />The area of land that was destroyed was approximately 100 by 100 square meters and an aerial photo of it is still posted on the Israeli Foreign Affairs website. This area was less than 3% of the city which is  The area that was destroyed was done so to root out terrorists, the majority of suicide bombers that murdered innocent Israeli women, men and children came from Jenin.<br />Prior to the IDF operation Defensive Wall Jenin's leading terrorist organizations were mainly centered in it's refugee camp. The leading groups were:<br />1. Hamas<br />Hamas' Jenin network organized a number of lethal suicide attacks, most recently in Haifa on March 31, in which 15 Israelis were killed. The Jenin network operated jointly with diverse operational elements in the Hamas movement and its overseas leadership. This network was severely damaged by the IDF in Tubas on April 5. Six major Hamas terror leaders were killed, including Qis Adwan (head of the Jenin infrastructure and organizer of suicide attacks killing dozens of Israelis), and Sa'ed Awad (chief of the QASSAM-2 missile project. Awad's death was effective in slowing missile production in Samaria).<br />Other senior activists - Nasser Jerar (involved in planning major attacks in Israel) and Jamal Abu Al Hija (Hamas' Jenin head, responsible for directing and financing terror activities) - are still at large.<br />2. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)<br />Until the IDF operation, the PIJ infrastructure in Jenin was the strongest in the PA's territories, due mostly to massive financial injections from the PIJ leadership in Syria. Details of these financial transactions have been verified by captured documents. The PIJ suffered a severe setback with the death of its Jenin military leader, Mahmud Tu'albe (responsible for a string of terrorist attacks inside Israel), and the arrest of senior operational figures, including Ali Safuri and Thabet Mardawi (both responsible for a large number of suicide and murder attacks).<br />3. Fatah / Al Aqsa Brigades / Tanzim<br />Fatah's Jenin network served as a central focus for terror activities. According to captured documents, local Fatah members, in close contact with Marwan Barghouti, carried out scores of shooting and explosives attacks against the IDF and Israeli civilians. Among these assaults was the March 30 suicide attack in a Tel Aviv coffee shop, where an Israeli civilian was killed and 45 wounded. Prominent senior Fatah activists include Jamal Hawil (arrested by the IDF for directing lethal terrorist attacks) and Ita Abu Ramila (Fatah and Preventive Security Apparatus leader in Jenin).	2003-08-14

The text is well written and easy to understand.  Drosnin starts off by telling how he was alerted to the possibility that there may be a hidden code in the Bible, by an Israeli mathmatician called Dr Eli Rips.  Rips noted that the Bible code (a computer program) had linked Yitzak Rabin's name to a man called 'Amir' and the words 'assassin will assassinate'.  This information was allegedly coded in the Bible thousands of years before the assassination of Rabin actually occurred.<br />The book is well written and easy to understand with numerous examples supporting the theory that there indeed may be a hidden code in the Bible.  The fact that the person who discovered the code is a mathematicican and also that the code had been verified by scientists from numerous prestigious universities also added weight to the plausibility of the book.<br />Although the book has caused quite an amount of controversy, this simply verifies the fact that the whole idea of a hidden bible code needs further investigation.<br />An excellent read - if you read the first book the Bible code there is every chance that you may wish to continue with the sequel the Bible Code II.	2003-08-09

He argues incisively that Darwinism cannot be verified by the empirical evidence.  Therefore the very foundation of Darwinism is not rooted in science but a philosophy of naturalism.  It is this worldview of naturalism, which colors all the evidence and provides the shaky foundation for Darwinian science.<br />Darwinists have a healthy corner on the market of science by being the very ones who define science in their favor.  They argue that the most basic characteristic of science is reliance upon naturalistic explanations.  Any appeal to the supernatural or transcendent by definition is excluded.  Any form of theistic creationism is therefore excluded.  Such a theory of theistic creation is viewed by scientists as non-science and by many as non-sense.  The deck has been clearly stacked against theism.<br />Johnson's main task in Darwin on Trial is to show that the conflict is not between science and non-science, but between two competing worldviews.  There is naturalism, which by definition excludes all forms of the divine, and there is the worldview of theism that argues for a God who created all things.  It is this worldview clash, which is at the heart of the evolution debate.<br />Johnson surveys the scientific evidence offered for evolution and finds it wanting.  He deals with natural selection, mutation theory, and the fossil record, the vertebrate sequence, molecular evidence and prebiological evolution.  He then examines the philosophical underpinnings of evolutionary theory and argues that evolution as fact is hinged upon philosophy and not science.  It is a philosophical theory, which uses science only for minimal confirmation.  The philosophical worldview of evolution colors all the empirical \\"confirming\\" evidence, which is used to verify the \\"truth\\" of Darwinism.<br />The importance of Darwin on Trial is to show that the debate over evolution is a worldview clash.  The empirical evidence still needs to be examined and debated, but no longer can either side claim absolute objectivity in interpreting the evidence.  Interpretation is filtered through one's worldview and all scientists are required to acknowledge their worldview whether it is naturalistic or theistic.<br />Darwin on Trial is accessible for both scientists and non-scientists.  It is an enjoyable read as Johnson is astute in pointing out the many fallacies of Darwinian thought.  On more than one occasion you are left in shock that a highly educated scientist such as Gould or Dawkins would make such logically fallacious statements.  Johnson also provides a response to his critics as an appendix in the second edition.  He responds to Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Ruse and many others who have attempted to debunk his book.<br />If you are new to the debate or just want to freshen up this is a great place to start.  The only major criticism I have is that there are no footnotes (only research notes in the back of the book).  The documentation is there but a bit hard to follow at times.  Other than this small criticism Phillip Johnson's Darwin on Trial steers a helpful course in the murky waters of evolutionary science.lash.

My sister died suddenly in her sleep of a brain aneurysm, 9 days after giving birth to her second child.  The oldest child, not quite 3 years old at the time, was the first to try to wake her that morning.  How do you help a little child understand death and loss - what do you say?  What should you not say?  I needed specific answers and detailed explanations to guide my nephew through this horrible time for all of us.  The author not only verified my instinct to be honest with my nephew, but also encouraged me to become a grief-model for him.  She also explains how a child will \\"regrieve\\" a loss, such as the death of a parent, many times throughout their lives, and shows how crucial it is that a child learn to deal with and work through grief.  Other losses that children experience, such as divorce, are also dealt with in a very comprehensive manner.  Loss is a fact of life, and Ms. Trozzi and Ms. Massimini offer invaluable lessons to help you teach your child to deal with these inevitable losses.  I keep several copies of this book on hand, because I give it to almost everyone I know.  Don't wait till you need this book - read it now!!!

Focusing on the last fifteen years of Frederic Chopin's life, this biography of the composer shows how his relationship with the &quot;liberated&quot; author George Sand, her household, and her children dominated Chopin's life in France from shortly after his arrival there in 1831 until his death from tuberculosis in 1849.  Carefully researched and footnoted, the biography describes this unlikely relationship, sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes strained, either from Chopin's increasing debilitation from his devastating illness or from Sand's promiscuity and desire for excitement.<br />Confining herself to those details which can be historically verified, author Eisler documents her vivid account of their life together primarily through references to the letters of the participants and eyewitness accounts.  Unlike writers of fictionalized biography, she presents the facts and avoids drawing conclusions, even when they seem obvious to the lay reader.  The one arena in which she allows herself some imaginative  leeway is in analyzing some of the creative works of Chopin and Sand, relating them to events in their lives.  For Chopin she suggests that the mood or form of a work might be related to particular events or circumstances, while for Sand she suggests that it might be the subject matter itself.<br />Straightforward and scholarly, the biography presents facts, rather then bringing events to life, and while some insight can be gained into the participants from their letters, there are some gaps in the historical record which sometimes leave the reader wishing for more transitions, especially as the Chopin/Sand relationship deteriorates and eventually ends.  While music history scholars may be familiar with much of this material, Eisler's story is, for the novice, a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of these romantic artists, their friends, and patrons in Paris near the mid-point of the 19th century.

The chapters are mind-boggling to read. All 4 Capitol & Others vs Vee Jay legal cases are thoroughly detailed though I have skimmed through these because it's just so much to take in. The chapter on \\"Introducing The Beatles\\" was my main interest because I have a copy of the Mono Version #1 LP which I bought in an Auction here over 10 years ago. I have verified that it's the real deal thanks to this book + Perry Cox's \\"Beatles Price Guide\\". No, it's not for sale either!! The label representations and pictures of old original 45's are amazing and enough to drool over.  I can't add much more than my colleague reviewers here other than you must have this and the Author's other books (On Capitol #1 & 2 & On Apple) if you're a serious Beatle nut like me. Even if you're not it's a wonderful addition to any Rock Music book library.	2003-07-19

LIVING HISTORY : Fact or Fiction ?<br />I don't think I am in a position to review Hillary Clinton's recently published book \\"LIVING HISTORY\\". After reading the book and numerous reviews/comments my first question was \\"Whether it is a fact or fiction\\". Being away from USA I know much less about USA and I rely upon the comments of US citizens. Based on their comments and from the few anomalies that I noticed between my acquired information and that supplied in this book I have to opine, \\"the book does not reveal facts\\".  A book needs certain qualities to become fiction. The most essential quality of fiction is, after finishing it the reader must feel something positive about some of the topics discussed in the book. I did not notice anything of that sort. After finishing the book none of USA (as a political entity), US government, US President, or the post of First lady appears in the mind of the reader with a new or brighter dimension. The information supplied are the same as one knows from other sources. There is no analysis of the situation or no suggestion for improvement. The language of course fluent and good. But the narration is close to those by the journalists. Probably Mrs. Hillary hired services of journalists. In that case I have a suggestion. The journalists could have verified the information from genuine sources and could raise it to the status of facts. In that case no one would look for language or type of narration, but it would become a part of US history. Loosing the qualities of both fact and fiction the book has turned into a pass-time book. I know the story of the president or first lady is one of the most attractive items for the common US citizens. I won't wonder if this books to turn to a popular pass-time material at home and abroad.<BR> ...	2003-07-12

This was one of the best written and most informative overviews of Celtic life that I have ever read.  Using sources ranging from Greek and Roman records and memoires, Irish legends, and the archeological record, the book covers everthing from warfare, daily life, diet, and the role of women, to religion, class structure, and technology (pointing out for example that the Celts invented or brought to Europe soap, chainmail, horse shoes, wooden barrels, steel swords and etc.) <BR>My only complaint about this first section is that a bibiography would have been nice. The author also celtic swords as being four feet long and nearly impossible to wield one handed. Every celtic sword I've seen from archeological finds were three feet or less and usually had small grips only suitible for one hand use.  All in all though I learned several facts and fascinating anecdotes I hadn't known about, which I later verified from other sources.  Anyone intersted in the celts should love this book. <BR>The second half with the D20 material is equally fascinating, and introduces several new combat rules and rules on social aspects such as prestige which could be applicable to many other genres.	2003-07-11

Ahead of the Market is the best of that breed in describing the inherent conflicts of interest in providing advice that is only half paid for by brokerage commissions.  The rest of the money has to come from investment banking fees . . . and you get those for toadying up to the companies you cover.  The individual investor is often victimized in the process.  Some of the especially valuable parts of the book are tables and statistics that document the issues Mr. Zacks describes.  Along the way, you will learn how you should read a sell-side analyst report, and interpret what is and is not saying.<br />The book deserves a five-star rating for its performance in shedding helpful light on this important subject for individual investors.<br />The book has another purpose . . . to help you find stocks to buy.  Basically, that approach is to look for companies whose sell-side e.p.s. estimates keep creeping up, and whose analyst ratings are rising.<br />Here the book is much less successful, and I would caution you to follow its advice very conservatively.  Basically, these &quot;signals&quot; are primarily helpful for short-term timing of whether to pick stock A or stock B when both look equally attractive to buy or sell.<br />Before you reject my warning, let me caution you that many of the charts that support the Zacks Method in the book are a little misleading.  First, the Zacks universe includes mostly small cap companies, yet almost all the examples compare results to the S&amp;P 500, a predominately large cap index.  So you are comparing apples and oranges.  Second, the comparisons look at stock-price change rather than total return (stock-price change plus dividends).  The S&amp;P 500 stocks usually pay dividends while smaller cap stocks often do not.  That can make the Zacks results look better than they are.  Third, to continually buy and sell the Zacks #1 list means owning around 200 stocks all of the time.  Is your portfolio large enough to do that?  Fourth, tax effects are ignored.  That's all right if you are dealing with a pension account, but not if you are using personal money outside of a tax-deferred account.  If you trade stocks in less than the capital gains period, you pay full marginal income tax rates (which often include alternative minimum tax hits).  If you hold for longer than the capital gains period, your maximum federal rate is 15%.  Dividends have a similarly favorable treatment over short-term stock-price gains.  Fifth, these ratings can change daily.  Do you have the time or interest to track and trade almost every business day of the year?  Sixth, the exceptions that Mr. Zacks encourages you to follow are reasonably complicated.  Can you understand and remember them all?  Seventh, many of the companies being scanned only have one analyst following them.  The universe of companies being covered by a reasonable number of competent analysts is quite small, and is mostly comprised of companies whose stocks are not going to grow very fast.  There are other problems, but I will not bore you with them.  Just note that the insights are of less potential value to you than the raw exhibits suggest.<br />Personally, I find the Zacks e.p.s. estimates to be one of several helpful inputs to check before buying and selling a stock.  One reason I like to look at the information is to check if my perceptions of the situation need to be further verified with more research.  I often find that that is the case.  So Zacks information has helped me avoid mistakes in the past, and will probably do so again.<br />I got a lot of benefit from the detail in the book about how to use the Zacks web site, which I find hard to navigate.<br />Before finishing this review, I should mention that the Zacks data on companies are very high quality and are constantly being improved.  Any misleading comparisons could have been overcome by merely selecting different ways to interrogate the data base.  Hopefully, this book will go into another printing or edition, and some of these changes can be made.  I share my comments in the spirit of helping with the optimum display of this information.<br /><br />The book is conveniently organized for a quick scan, or a quick revisit of key sections.  Materials are summarized in a number of different ways including within the text, at the end of chapters, and in the book's conclusion beginning on page 244.<br />After you finish reading and thinking about this book, consider where else in your life you get information that is mostly &quot;paid for&quot; by someone else for a different purpose.

This book, like many of Prima's guides that cover a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) is a mixed bag.<br />On one hand, the descriptions of some of the professions in the game are handy, but some of them are already wrong, due to changes already in place. The maps are handy to have in front of you, but the in-game map system does the same job. The descriptions of the various weapons and armor are nice, but omit higher-level items, which has become somewhat of a trademark of Prima's authorized guides.<br />All in all, the layout is nice, and this is one of Prima's few full color guides. But the information contained within should be verified with a more up to date source before you rely on it. And, if anyone from Prima is reading this, please, PLEASE hire a more effective proofreader. Some of the grammatical and written errors in this book are almost comical. Almost.<br />All in all, it's a handy book to have around, but I won't be relying on it as a guide.

US	40906112	R2592J46VOA9KV	0679447172	284000734	The Gates of the Alamo	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good Account of the Historical Battle	All things considered, this was not a bad book.  It held my interest from beginning to end, mostly because of the strength of the novel's first half and the strong character development there.  The fictional story is naturally overshadowed in the second half by the historical battle.<br />In the first half, we get a glimpse of Texas frontier life through Mary Mott and her son Terrell as they run their inn near the gulf coast.  We see the inside of Mexican politics through Edmund, the botanist who works for the government of Mexico, and through this plot device we are able to see the political situation from a Mexican perspective.  The Mexicans saw North Americans as \\"land pirates.\\"  After all, Texas was part of Mexico.<br />The action that eventually brings Mary and Edmund together is both interesting and informative about the historical events that led to the Battle of the Alamo.  The budding relationship between Mary and Edmund is written in a subtle and sensitive way.  I liked both these characters in the beginning.  Edmund is proud and highly educated but has absolutely no knowledge of women and apparently has never considered them necessary, his only love being his botanical study of Texas.  The widow Mary is wiser in a worldly sense and is attracted to Edmund but she waits for him to make the first move.  This complicated relationship keeps the first half moving.<br />Eventually the author needs to get his characters inside the Alamo and this is where the novel runs into trouble.  The formerly strong and wise protagonists, Mary and Edmund, choose to go to Bexar, a place they know will soon erupt into heated battle at the Alamo, for some rather silly and implausible reasons.  And as they get into more and more trouble on the way, I kept wondering why they ever went in the first place.  This weak link compromises the fictional story throughout the entire second half of the novel.<br />The battle itself is well done.  Harrigan writes battle scenes with realistically graphic violence and gore.  As with any so called historical novel, the author must be careful not to change history or historical persons, and at the same time invent dialog and actions that can never be verified.  Harrigan has done a good job with the battle itself.  He's taken out or changed some of the better-known legends.  He did this based on the latest available historical documents, according to an interview with him that was published on the Internet.<br />The fictional characters serve little purpose in the second half other than to get the reader into the Alamo, and later into the command post of Sam Houston. Harrigan pulls no punches in his treatment of this legendary Texas hero.  Houston is shown as a drunken vacillator who is despised by his men.<br />All in all this was a good novel.  Harrigan has enough love for Texas history not to revise it, but only to try to clarify it.  An historical novel is not a bad way to teach history as long as the reader can keep the fiction separate from the history.  This fictional story falls apart in the second half, but you don't buy a book called \\"Gates of the Alamo\\" to read a love story.	2003-07-05

Therein lies the beauty of it all:  Each reader can consult the ORIGINAL source of information and follow its path to today rather than rely on the reconstituted, misinformed, and very lazy opinion of &quot;pundits&quot; who speak on the basis of a blending between their personal emotion and half-truths.

This is significant because for the ten years previous I had lived in Indialantic, Florida, fished regularly in the Gulf Stream and had made a few passages to the Bahamas. What those of us who actually lived in the area and sailed the waters did not know was that some creative people had been generating a sensation, and a good bit of revenue, by spinning a wild myth out of misinformation and a few isolated disappearances. And let's face it, in the age before geolocators and satellite systems, there were several disappearances at sea every year. Actually, there still are. The ocean is a big, deadly pace.<br />Flight 19 is a classic example. On a training flight, the trainer's instrument panel went out. Not unheard of. He turns navigational duties over to a trainee; again not unheard of and understandable under the circumstances. The trainee has trouble with his readings, so the flight eyeballs the surface to see were they are. They see the Bahamas, but think they're looking at the Florida Keys. Going above the clouds, they sight by the sky and head for Florida. Tragically, that course carries them over the open Atlantic.  Throughout all of this, ground control can hear their radio chatter, but the planes can not hear base. In those days this was a fairly common occurrence with the primitive radio systems available. A plane was dispatched to intercept and rescue the wayward pilots. What happened aboard that plane really is a mystery. According to witnesses, it exploded in midair over the ocean within sight of land. However, by the time it was verified the first plane was lost (remember, this was before or modern instant communications and flight transponders) and another could be dispatched it was too late. Though three position due east of New Smyrna had been calculated by those on shore, Flight 19 had gone down in the swiftly flowing currents of the Atlantic. Rescuers literally had no idea where to look.<br />Charlatans used this tragic story to manufacture a myth. The failed instrument panel became wildly spinning compasses, the instructor telling the other trainees to follow the one he designated navigator instead of him became a desperate warning to rescuers not to try and follow. A mysterious message about the sky and sea seeming \\"wrong\\" was manufactured. (Often quoted, by charlatans and true believers alike, but still false.)<br />Other examples include the Revnoc, which went down in 40-foot seas during one of the worst hurricanes of the decade. In legend, it disappeared in front of witnesses in bright sunlight while sailing on a calm sea. A sulfur ship which sank in the Gulf and a freighter that disappeared off the coast of Africa are also included in the chronicle.<br />Some disappearances are not explained. The ocean is very big, very secretive, and very unforgiving. The nature of the environment -- not any mysterious forces -- means there will always be questions we can never answer. This book does a lot to seperate the genuine mysteries from the hype.erally had no idea where to look.<br />Charlatans used this tragic story to manufacture a myth.

There is really an acute shortage of material on this topic and when I heard about this book, I couldn't wait to get it.<br />It started off amazing. Although Mr. Crile has not specifically stated his sources, I generally trusted what he was saying (he being a journalist, sources being attached to sensitive organizations and what not) but all my excitement deflated when I reached page 60 something where Mr. Crile describes the relations of Joanne Herring and General Zia. He wrote that Joanne was called \\"sir\\" in Pakistan. Give me a break. Maybe some peon in some office may have called her \\"sir\\" but that doesn't qualify as a fact worth quoting. The bigger and more outrageous claim was just a few lines down on the same page where Mr. Crile says that Joanne Herring was given the highest honor that Pakistani Government can give and that is the title of \\"Quid-e-Azam\\" translated as \\"The Great Leader\\". I dropped first my jaw and then the book when I read that. It's ridiculous. It's so painfully obvious to me that Mr. Crile's sources were exaggerating and Mr. Crile didn't do any effort to corroborate the information. Had he'd done that, he would have come to known that the title of \\"Quid-e-Azam\\" is reserved for the founder of Pakistan, M. A. Jinnah and it's not conferred upon anyone else by Pakistan Government. It's like saying that US president honored someone with the title of \\"The Founding Father\\". As I said, it's ridiculous. I could give him the benefit of doubt if there was an honor which sounded like \\"Quid-e-Azam\\". There isn't. They are all like 'Nishan-e-Imtiaz\\", \\"Sitara-e-Imtiaz\\" etc. and none of their meanings come anywhere close to \\"The Great Leader\\". Its not that I think that Mr. Crile is lying. He just heard something and quoted it in a \\"history\\" book. Historians used to be a bit more cautious in recording facts. Had he'd tried to verify that from any (and I mean ANY, it's that common knowledge) Pakistani, he/she would have told him that that \\"fact\\" can not possibly be true.<br />That was it for me. The book's credibility was GONE. I tried to go beyond that and read some 100 pages more but now that I knew for sure that Mr. Crile's sources had passed him blown up info and he hadn't verified it, the only way I could read it anymore was to consider it a work of fiction but then, its not written very well for a fictional book.<br />I have a lot more to say about how Mr. Cile's sources have described Zia and some other things but I won't. It's useless.	2003-07-02

It is an excellent introduction to physics and an outstanding overview of &quot;string theory&quot; that is accessible to the layman (in as much as particle physics *can* be accessible without a real knowledge of mathematics.)<br />The Elegant Universe is worth the purchase price, if only for chapters 2,3 and 4 which lay out, in terms understandable by anyone, the ideas behind Einstein's theory of special relativity, Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics.  I highly recommend it for this purpose alone.<br />The rest of the book deals with the central connudrum of modern physics which is, unfortunately, although the theories of relativity (governing large systems) and quantum mechanics (governing minute systems) have been experimentally verified over the past century and are indeed true, they are *not compatible*.  Greene does a good job of explaining why the theories are in conflict with one another.<br />The rest of the book deals with string theory, which Greene and a lot of other string theorists claim can &quot;bridge the gap&quot; between relativity and quantum mechanics.  Although Greene does a terrific job of explaining string theory through graspable metaphors, towards the end end of the book, my tiny brain had difficulty understanding some of the concepts.<br />Yet, by far, Greene provides the most accessible description of this revolution in physics.  Greene is quite obviously an ardent evangelist of string theory and his optimism concerning its possibilities lend a certain energy to the read, getting you through the difficult parts.

US	41687698	RP2KSNCZ68MVR	1400050308	820650568	Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism	Books	5	5	6	N	N	WHO WOULD'VE THUNK IT	I would never imagine anyone anywhere would dare to write a book in which Senator McCarthy is a prominent topic and actually craft an argument IN FAVOR of McCarthy!  And yet Ann Coulter does so, and succeeds quite well in presenting her point that a very great deal of the Senator's ominous warnings were not only correct, but actually underestimated the true nature of the corruption and level of infiltration in the United States' government by people (inevitably they were the creme de la creme of liberal society)  who were not merely sympathetic towards the \\"Worker's Paradise\\", but actually actively working against their own country.<br />     What gives so much weight to the book is the FACT that indeed the Democratic party was utterly infested during the 1950's by people actively working against the interests of the United States.  What makes this a FACT rather than just the rantings of a deluded conservitive pundit?  Well, the Venona Project confirms it as FACT.  Incredibly enough, I've never heard of the Venona Project until having read this book.  What is the Venona Project?  Well, the United States Army was able to crack the encryption codes used by the USSR during the 1950's and as such were able to intercept and decode messages/cables sent by the USSR to the many active Soviet agents in the United States and this operation, kept secret from even Truman himself, was named the Venona Project.  This information was declassified in 1995 and finally made public, but much to my amazement, it has not received anywhere near the attention it deserves.  If anything, Venona proves that during the 1950's it was odd not to find a prominent Democrat who was not on the Soviet payroll or advised by someone not on the clock for Joe Stalin.  The declassification of the Venona Project cannot be but the most despairing and shameful of revelations for liberals.<BR>   <BR>     The book is a gripping read and infuriating at the same time.  One cannot help but feel rage at the senseof how own's own country has been duped and betrayed by so many of those in positions with the sworn duty to protect her.  One may very well disagree with the conclusions Coulter draws from these historical FACTS concerning liberals in general, but one cannot argue with the veracity of the FACTS Coulter uses for her argument since the treason she speaks of is independently corroborated and verified by the Venona Project.  Of course, I cannot see how one can accept the evidence Coulter presents as FACTUAL and not inevitably come to the same conclusion that Coulter does; that is, liberals and their ideology seem to quite often go against what is in the best interests of America and more often than not side with America's enemies rather than with America herself whenever a direct conflict arises.  Coulter follows this diheartening tendency which liberals seem to have a propensity for in detail from the post WWII era to the present.  <br />     At the very least, even if one disagrees with Coulter's conclusions, the book is a wonderfully interesting read because it shows how an immense  honeycomb of active Soviet spies were colluding against America at the highest levels of the Truman presidency at a scale so unbelievable that it dwarfs the fictional plots of the many spy/mystery genre novels of which I am so fond of.  (I assure you that if Tom Clancy ever wrote a novel with a situation analogous to that which was present during the Truman presidency it would be instantly discredited because the premise of the novel would be too preposterous even for fiction!)  Whether or not one agrees with Coulter's take on Senator McCarthy, it really cannot be argued that the story of \\"McCarthyism\\" has come to so dominate the present day image and narrative of political America in the 1950's that very few people have had an opportunity to learn about the massive infiltration of foreign agents in the American government which also occurred in the 1950's as verified by the declassified Venona Project files.  The book's review of this incredibly overlooked piece of amazing history makes it a worthwhile read even for non-Coulter fans.  Get it now!  Its worth it!	2003-06-26

There are two descriptions intertwined: chronological narrative (ending with surprising developments in the big business of fur trading, those guys don't ride out into the sunset) and a description of various aspects of life in the West before settlement.  I guess there are some unverified stories in there (I always wondered why Indians would murder one white man, and let the other run for his life, and why, unlike Iroquouis, and much like Karl May's Indians, they didn't think there was more merit in killing a brave and skillful man who perhaps had killed many Indians previously), Mountain Men's braggings, but I am glad the author does mention those guys tendency toward exaggeration.	2003-06-22

This is more than simply a canned reworking of a bunch of ancient spells, but a well-constructed and systematic walk through the development of a system of magical cosmology, theology, theory and praxis.<br />This isn't a beginner's book. A decent grounding in ceremonial magic theory is definitely recommended. Better books in that vein might be Crowley's &quot;Magick&quot;, or Regardie's &quot;The Golden Dawn&quot;. For a practitioner with the necessary background, this is potentially an extremely valuable book.<br />Another review makes a number of loose assertions, particularly that Flowers has wilfully mistranslated the spells in order to put some sort of &quot;Satanic&quot; spin on them. Flowers helpfully provides full references to the Greek papyri throughout this book, and I've verified that there is no substance to the other reviewer's claims. I went so far as to email him to see if he had any rebuttal to make, but haven't ever received a response. The references back to Betz are consistent and complete; it's trivial to verify that there are no &quot;tricks&quot; in the translations.<br />I recommend getting a copy of Betz' book as well, not only as a cross reference, but for access to a wealth of other related material which Flowers did not incorporate. Flowers has included a variety of useful tables and diagrams of relevant material, including details of several writing systems used in the source material.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-21

SGT O'Donnell's novel represents a dream of what could have been done to restore order from the powerless trauma of what had to be done regarding the U.S. Government's requirement to abandon K-9s at the end of the Vietnam War. It is a poignant piece criss-crossed with hope and hopelessness and potentially represents the way many US K-9 and MWD Teams felt at that time in history. The perceived anguish, search for understanding as well as a means to salute those K-9 counterparts is an excellent read and worth consideration by all individuals familiar with those events in our Nation's history or who experienced similar feelings first-hand of the loss of the K-9s who were and continue to be among our most outstanding yet most unsung heroes throughout all branches of the Armed Forces in all aspects and in all countries involved within the Vietnam War Combat Zone.	2003-06-15

Not even close.  He said that it definitely warrants further invesigation into the phenomenon.  At the time the book came out, the western world was against any idea of reincarnation as it flew in the face of western thinking (Although, lets take a look: hundreds of millions of people take reincarnation as a fact of life as part of their religion).  The discreditors of the story never once found any way to show the story was a fraud.  In fact, the discreditor happened to be a Chicago TABLOID!!!  The women allegedly named Bridey Murphy who lived across the street upon further investigation turned out to be the mother of the TABLOID's owner.  The person below me mentioned occum's razor (the simplest solution tend to be correct)  Think about that.  In fact, when a more credible Chicago paper picked up the TABLOID's story, it had to cut out a whole bunch of arguments because they were just way too outrageous.  ex:  When Ruth Simmons was a girl she had a park accross the street which she played in many times.  This explains why she would have said she lived in \\"the meadow.\\"<BR>      Now that is just ridiculous, especially when a hand-drawn 1800's map of the city Cork, the area in which Bridey lived according to Ruth's sessions was called \\"The meadow.\\"  Now Ruth, living in America her whole life, and having never even heard of the town called Cork, recalls an area of only a couple square miles in the 1800's in Ireland.  None of this was made up.  Everything Ruth said under hypnosis has been verified to be real and not  a hoax.  am i saying that reincarnation exists?  After reading the book, i believe.  But please, read the book and don't read anything trying to close your mind to one of the most amazing cases of age-regression hypnosisever told.	2003-06-11

Despain was a Body Guarded, Union Busting Dictator	In my opinion, You should \\"BUY THIS BOOK\\" because this is a \\"GREAT BOOK\\" of what \\"Should and Could be\\", and an Excellent \\"LIFE VALUES (Common Values) BASED Leadership  Book\\".    However, it DOES NOT portray True Facts of how Despain managed the East Peoria Plant, are \\"Nothing\\" like what Despain said in the book and my facts can be verified and backed up.  Throughout this entire book, it talks about \\"Excellencia Performances and Situations\\", supposedly, managed by a Great People Person Leader (Despain), of which the East Peoria Plant was managed exactly the opposite.  In East Peoria it was \\"Despain's Way\\" or \\"The Highway\\".  I really believe Despain wanted the East Peoria Plant operated in a \\"Fair and have Dignity for All, Environment\\", yet Despain ruled as Iron Fisted Dictator with such a ferocious fist, that if you got in his way, his \\"AX\\" beheaded the best and the brilliant.  It was truly \\"Despain's (his) Way or the Highway\\".  <br />   In Chapter 16, \\"The Struggle is On\\", Despain never mentions the \\"Breaking of the Union\\".  Despain was --\\"Well Noted\\"-- for breaking the back of the Union in East Peoria by hiring Vance Security Guards during the strike and having 2 - 4 body guards most of the time (24-hours a day) during the 17 month 1994-1995 Union strike, and these Thugs continued to body guard him after the strike was over??   He even had guards at his house!!!  These guys looked like HULK HOGAN!!  This was not even mentioned in the book!!  These body guards, along with around 200 other thugs hired by Caterpillar, Inc., intimidated, threatened and used bodily force to FORCE the Union People to COOPERATE in the 1994-1995 strike.  Why didn't he mention the Thugs in his book, he helped hire them??   If everything was the way the book portrayed, why did he need protection?  Vice President Robert Dryden did not ever have any body guards, to my knowledge, and Mr. Dryden managed manufacturing bldg's & shops, adjacent to Mr. Despain's shops, in the same East Peoria Plantin Building KK.<br />  I believe this book reflected Bob Gordon's feelings and it is Bob Gordon who was the \\"Brilliant One\\" that Originated \\"The Common Values\\", Despain even admits this in \\"Gordo's Group Vision\\" on page 135-136.   I should know, I worked for both of them.   Gordon wanted to exemplify, bring out and identify the Brilliant, the Individual Thinkers, Entrepreneurs, Self Starters, and truly your Future Leaders and Superstars.  But what actually took place, was opposite of this book.  I believe Despain used this tactic, of the \\"Common Values\\", by this despotic dictator, to \\"Identify or Bring out the names of these free thinkers and individuals so he could eliminate and dispose of, what he thought was, his foes, as he broke the Union and all the free spirit of which he was trying to promote!<br />  The descriptions and representations, throughout this book, are figments of a man's imagination, and are truly \\"NOT\\" representative of what actually took place within the walls of the East Peoria Plant, but what kind of place Despain wanted, in my opinion.<br />   On pages 136, 191 and many others it talks of \\"Risk Taking\\" and mistakes should not be punished but made learning experiences.  If his feelings toward Risk Taking were like he said in his book, why would he terminate an employee after this employee saved him an annual $1,000,000.00 cost savings/reductions by re-writing his computer manufacturing complexes in the East Peoria Tractor facility.  These Common Values and value-based leaderships, described in his material, are \\"Great\\" if they are in the proper hands, however, they were never implemented, as far as I could see.  <br />  I was in the middle of my Residency for my Ph.D. at the U of I, with five classes to go, when he fired me, with no warning, no meeting, no conversation, no nothing!  Is this the \\"Common Values\\" and \\"Values Leadership\\" that Despain talks about in his book?  Despain, says, \\"There should never be any punishment for making a mistake\\"!!  Isn't termination punishment??   Despain never one time talked with me or told me I was doing poorly, let alone enough to terminate me, because he gave me free rein to do what I thought best, just like the 1 million dollar cost savings.<br />   Is this what Despain meant when he said we were given the freedom to do what we thought we needed to do, then terminate you without any communication, after 22 years of service to Caterpillar?  These \\"Common Values\\" were ONLY COMMON to Despain!!<br />I felt Mr. Despain was A \\"True Iron Fisted\\", \\"My Way or the Highway\\" Despotic Dictator.  I give this book 1 Star for its intent to promote \\"Common Values\\", but it truly has many \\"Fictional Parts\\"!	2003-06-10

This is an absolutely fascinating book, there is no question about that. The other reviewers have thoroughly reviewed it but I want to add one comment:<br />Whether the Book of Mormon is historical and can be substantiated by archeology or not is absolutely irrelevant to the real issue: Is Mormonism a true religion or is it a false religion? Even if essentially every verifiable statement in the Book of Mormon is verified such is irrelevant; all that it demonstrates is that Joseph Smith had access, in whatever possible manner, whether through available writings or through the Revelations of Moroni, to accurate information.<br />Mormon Doctrine (Second Edition), Bruce R. McConkie, Page 321<br />Joseph Smith said &quot;God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!... I am going to tell you how God came to be God... and that he (God, reviewer's comment) was once a man like us; yea, that God himself, the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ himself did; and I will show it from the Bible...&quot;<br />Both the Jews of the Torah/Tanakh and the Christians accept the following without reservation:<br />Deuteronomy 6:4 HEAR, O ISRAEL: THE LORD OUR GOD, THE LORD IS ONE.<br />The Mormons may well argue that the Christians apostasized (they didn't), but to support the Mormon view of the plurality of 'gods' would require that the Jews apostasized, too, and that they no longer know the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?<br />You decide if the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints is Biblical or not? If you are 'religious' then you might want to consider the consequences of error? You decide, Jesus or Joseph, in whom will you entrust your eternal destiny? This is the real question and the only question!<br />If you are not 'religious', then this is just an interesting account of one man's search for the truth and how, ultimately, he decided that the truth was irrelevant...	2003-06-09

If one is going is going to call the Commander-in-Chief 'derelict' then it behooves the accuser to present facts which are documented and can be verified.  Patterson fails the test consistently.  His biggest lie is that Bill Clinton left our military establishment weak and demoralized.  Try telling that to some of our fighting men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Our troops continue to be the best-trained in the world and Patterson surely knows that.  He has done his former military colleagues a troubling disservice by writing such nonsense.

PLease.<br />It starts off interesting, but wears off quickly. Mostly parrotting of liberal views of biblical archeology, with some dialogue between the author and various experts, mostly to show the author's &quot;intellectual sparring&quot; and new &quot;insights&quot;. Liberal scholarship, by the way, is most notable for denying pretty much anything described in the Bible, such as positing that the Exodus is a warped version of a couple of hundered slaves leaving Egypt over many years - a theory so idiotic, so denigrating of the intelligence of ancient peoples that it reveals more about the desperate longings of some archeologists for an alternate reality where the Bible has not been repeatedly verified by their own science. And see &quot;Riddle of the Exodus&quot; for an interesting new theory.<br />Interviews invariably terminate on this note: we can't believe the Bible as an historical document, but we can believe its message (???) by faith - OK if you're content to base your life on what you believe to be a work of fiction, I suppose, but not the most intellectually satisfying tack. Have they never read &quot;Biblical Archeology Review&quot;? (which presents views of both pseudoskeptics and objective archeologists.)<br />It is interesting to read about people who feel a connection to the land, and have decided to live there because of their feeling tied to the Bible record. There is also some interesting information regarding different sites mentioned in the Bible. But one gets the feeling that these could have been written into a much shorter book.<br />Not much excitement otherwise. There's really not much action at all. Unless you count actually seeing a gun on a patrolling guard as action.<br />The problem is that most of the insight to be gleaned is based upon orthodox Egyptology, which is not based upon much hard evidence, and in fact ignores such things as the problem of probable water erosion on the Sphinx and the wafer-thin assertions regarding Egyptian chronologies. So the insights are based upon what is probably fiction (in terms of the &quot;historical&quot; context - who was the Pharaoh of the Exodus and so on) to start with.<br />But what if there were a book which compared the writings of an Egyptian sage with the Ten Plagues of the Exodus?

Instead, one gets a remarkably even-handed treatment of Rhodes.  It would be easy simply to characterize Rhodes as evil, but to Thomas' credit, he does not take the easy way out.  He is more than prepared to exam what can be best described as Rhodes' moral ambiguity.<br />I would not call Rhodes amoral in the strictist sense.  He knew well enough when he was doing wrong to want to conceal his activities.  Nor would I call him a ruthless pragmatist.  His devotion to his friends was quite real, and in the case of Neville Pickering's death, Rhodes' all-consuming grief ultimately kept him from purchasing land that he knew was rich in gold.  His personal feelings kept him from making a second, utterly massive, fortune in gold.  That is hardly the action of pragmatist.<br />Trying to figure out what made Rhodes tick becomes trickier the more one examines his deeds.  Even Thomas is vexed at times at how easily Rhodes moves from one alliance to another, and completely reverses his stands on issues such as native rights.  By the time of his death, Rhodes was lionized throughout the British Empire as being in the vanguard of imperialists, but Thomas shows that for most of his career, he was strictly pursuing his own economic and political interests, and did not cloak himself in the gard of British Imperialism until it was absolutely necessary.<br />Thomas does not only focus on Rhodes.  He demonstrates that most of the men that Rhodes dealt with could be, at times, just as morally ambiguous as he.  Rhodes knew well that every man has his price, and demonstrated it again and again.  Men in positions of power were irreconcilably opposed to Rhodes & his plans, at least until Rhodes made the right offer.  The Victorians would had one believe that they were paragons of virtue and rectitude, but reading of Rhodes' dealings with them makes such a claim hardly believable.<br />At the end of his life, Rhodes began to appreciate that a man's legacy would not be measured in the wealth that he amassed or in the deals that he made.  For Rhodes, that realization came too late.  Most of his accomplishments are now hardly remembered, and the man himself is remembered now more with scorn and revulsion that awe and respect.  Yet Rhodes was a remarkable man.  Thomas makes the distinction between being a remarkable man and a great man, and in this finds the true tragedy of Rhodes' life:  he had the talents to be a truly great man for all ages, but instead used these talents strictly to serve his own interests.<br />The book is quite easy to read, and is well-organized.  To Thomas' credit, he does not report all the stories about Rhodes as gospel, and if the historical record is unclear on certain matters, he will say so.  He also examines the conclusions made by other scholars on certain subjects and deals with this quite competently.  I was pleasantly suprised, since he is not a historian by profession.  I do note with interest that some events (such as the famous story of Rhodes dumping loads of diamonds into a bucket, just after Barney Barnato has purchased them) are reported by Thomas in the book as being stories which may or may not be true and cannot be verified by the historical record, but are presented in the \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\" production as being true.  It is a good indication that in the book at least, Thomas is trying his best to be a responsible scholar.th them makes such a claim hardly believable.<br />At the end of his life, Rhodes began to appreciate that a man's legacy would not be measured in the wealth that he amassed or in the deals that he made.

Included are explanations as well as personal \\"photographs\\". Written in a deceptively simple language, the book's vignette collection contains psychological lessons that are often quite subtle. Among the highlights of Ruth-Mueller's book is a multi-faceted description of her conscious teacher. \\"Bread Upon the Water\\"'s essential contents are no less than the finest gems of wisdom and truth.

It's not a \\"present-tense\\" action chronology we typically expect to read, but a fictional journal of activity and introspection that will continually have you flipping to the front cover to check if it really is a novel (Kaufman's own mother was similarly taken in)!  It is \\"written\\" by an unlikely historical hero, Mexican General Manual Fernandez Castrill&oacute;n, Aid-de-Camp for the Mexican president Santa Anna.  The real-life Castrill&oacute;n was born and bred in Cuba, served with Royal Spanish Colonial Army, then swapped allegiances to the Mexican forces, which earned him some prison time.  From 1822, on, he became a close friend and confident to Santa Anna.  Not personally an Alamo buff (and it's not just about the Alamo, per se, but more a vignette encompassing the events surrounding and including, the Alamo), yet fascinated with humanity and all its struggles, I was amused at how I was summarily drawn into, not just Castrill&oacute;n's head, but his acute sense of honor and duty, as well.  Being an extremely introspective individual myself, I found myself sympathizing with our Mexican general, as he did and saw things with which he didn't approve, but when things finally became far too corrupt for his concepts of duty and honor, he made his stand.  In a sense, you could say Castrill&oacute;n fought his own, personal, Alamo, against his commander and friend, who had became far too egotistical, or deranged, a force for his own good, and had \\"surrounded and crushed\\" Castrill&oacute;n, as they had both done to the brave inhabitants within the Alamo.  The final scene portraying Castrill&oacute;n, the author has verified as true, and is Dulce et Decorum Est, if tragic.  Had we had Castrill&oacute;n on our side, I'm sure the Alamo's outcome would have turned out far differently!<br />The Breach approaches this topic in an uncommon way, and I liked that.  It's from the  United States' 1836 enemy's point of view, it's done in journalistic, after-the-fact fashion, and we're inside this guy's head during the entirety of the story (with one, notable, exception).  I like this!  I must admit, however, that it did take me a little effort to get into the beginning of the book, but stick with it, and I don't think you'll be disappointed!  The Breach shows us that people are people, no matter what side of the border we live on, or which uniform we wear, and gives us a broader perspective on events, when, to us living in the U.S., in high school, we are usually only presented the details of the Alamo's last stand from our country's point of view.  We need more works like this.  Kaufman breeds empathy for a man who was just doing the best he could, in a very bad situation, and conveyed a sense of how I, too, could very well have been this man, this Castrill&oacute;n, in another time, at a different fork in the road.  Castrill&oacute;n, as portrayed by the author, is an honorable man, perhaps, as much so as any Davy Crockett or a Sam Houston, but who just so happened to pick the wrong side of the conflict, on which to fight.ashion, and we're inside this guy's head during the entirety of the story (with one, notable, exception).

Each story is less than a page and recounts a tale that has been told enough times that some people believe it to be true (i.e. alligators in the sewers).<br />While the topic is an interesting one, the writer's delivery is dry and sporadic.  There seem to be more details in stories set in England than elsewhere.  Overall there seems to be a strong English slant to the tales.<br />The stories are roughly grouped into categories such as Accidents, Medical, Criminal, Miscellaneous, and Sex.  Many of these seem to have been randomly place and would fit better in a different category.<br />Are they really legends?  No.  While some of the tales are classic urban legends (although in variations I have never heard before), some of the stories have other origins.  At least on tale is true and can be verified in the local papers (I won't tell you which one).  Others have been lifted straight from old movies and television shows (many decades old that is).  Maybe in England they don't know the origins of these particular tales, but American audiences will probably now where they were taken from.<br />If you are looking for a good collection of Urban Legends, this is certainly a cheap one, but it is not a particularly good one.	2003-05-16

Second, this book ain't it.<br /><br />The author gives a series of ethical case studies and then shows how he would quickly solve the problems (although he seldom tells the reader all the necessary details in his scenarios).  The author seems to believe ethics is like quantum physics or surgery -- people can be shown how problems are solved by the experts, but they should not try to do it themselves.  I consider this conclusion not only wrong, but potentially dangerous and inconsistent with liberal democracy.  Cohen's approach would leave us at the mercy of the self-proclaimed \\"experts\\" -- and I assume these \\"experts\\" would be lawyers, politicians, or professional ethicists. We've already conceded justice in this country to lawyers and politicians, with disastrous consequences for justice, and heaven help us if we should do the same with morality and ethics.<br /><br />A major quarrel I have with this book is the same quarrel I have with Mr. Cohen's New York Times articles -- the author's views are often inconsistent and downright wrong.  One case in point is his view on college honor codes requiring students to turn in known and verified cheaters.  Mr Cohen feels this is \\"tattling,\\" which can be effectively ignored by an ethical person, even if this means cheaters can continue to take advantage of the system.  Well, if I know someone is falsifying aircraft maintenance records, and do not \\"tattle,\\" I could rightly be considered partially liable for killing hundreds of people if their planes crash because of faulty repairs. Mr Cohen never draws a line between minor \\"tattling\\" and a crime of collaboration, and he never indicates how (or if) he would draw that line.  If a person does not develop a respect for honesty in a training situation like college, just where are they going to develop it?  College honor codes can help establish the kind of character that Mr Cohen's (poorly-developed) \\"virtue ethics\\" requires.  This is just one case in point.<br /><br />Last and least, the author's writing style often seems insufferably smug and smarmy.  Yecch. Poor writing is not necessary for good ethics.<br /><br />I hope professional ethicists won't do to ethics what lawyers have done to justice, but after reading this book, I am far less hopeful.eloped) \\"virtue ethics\\" requires.

Especially if you want to understand Bell's Inequality and how the experiments done by Alain Aspect in the 1980's verified that the inequality is violated.<br />I first heard of Bell's inequality and the EPR Paradox while reading an article by David Mermin in \\"Science News\\" and did not understand it at all.  Then I read Robert Adair's account of it in \\"The Great Design\\" (a good book to have) and I began to gain a rudimentary appreciation of what was going on.  But it wasn't until I read Ruhla's \\"Physics of Chance\\" that I learned how to derive the predictions of quantum theory - the predictions which show that two distant objects can exert influence on one another, \\"faster than the speed of light.\\"<br />But Bell's Inequality is not the only subject in here.  The text begins with rather simple treatments of probability, applied to coin tosses and telephone queues, on to Boltzmann Statistics, and then finally to quantum theory.  So as your reading through the chapters in the book, you pick up the \\"tools\\" you need as you go along, in order to understand the more difficult material later on.<br />Ruhla's writing style is engaging, although silly at times.  ...	2003-05-01

According to my experience, cost-effective and technically adequate qualification of new complex products takes almost the same time as their initial design.  Normally, proper stresses reveal faults, which have to be analyzed, fixed and verified through the new test.  Because of inherently long duration of regular reliability tests, a product under qualification may enter the market too late.  On the other hand, improper assessment may mislead a manufacturer, vendors and designers resulting in catastrophic field failures, loss of contracts and reputation.  Finally, cost of modern qualifications became rather high and nobody wants to waste money due to a wrong or ineffective approach.  Therefore, efficient accelerated tests followed by proper failure analysis and corrective actions become mandatory for any industry.  <br />In my opinion, the book of Lev and Eugene Klyatis fill in a gap in accelerated test methodology related to complex machinery, especially in transportation.  The book provides modern comprehensive and practical approach to this topic based on extremely broad international and US experience.  It combines scientific introduction into the test organization, failure physics, statistical estimates with a rather detailed practical description of environmental laboratory stressing.  One can find not just concepts, but recommendations regarding simulation of field conditions in a lab, test equipment and setups, combination of technically most efficient and cost-effective stresses.  A number of well-conceived life-on examples, reference tables and pictorial summaries provide condense guidance and ease digesting of this complex topic.  Correct implementation of the authors' approach expedites time-to-market of new products, provides tangible saving, and improve quality and reliability of new and existing systems.  <br />I highly recommend this manuscript to reliability and quality professionals, R&amp;D and manufacturing engineers working in machinery-related industries, especially in transportation.  I believe that this book may be successfully used in order to train appropriate college students with majors in quality, manufacturing and design engineering and management.  The book is certainly useful during continuous education program.	2003-04-30

Masterton has a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry and retired as a full Professor from the University of Connecticut in 1987. He had a long standing interest in this case, and began research after he retired (p.8). Chapters 1 to 8 give his short history of this crime, chapters 9 to 16 give his \\"solution\\". Many books have been written on the Borden Murders; the Sources on page 7 do not list those by E. Pearson and F. Spiering. Only two people were alive in that house after 11am. Lizzie was the likeliest suspect, but she couldn't have done it, and the jury agreed.    \\"Early accounts of the crime were loaded with factual errors\\" (p.18). This is a warning against using unverified newspaper records (p.8). Did Andrew Borden prosper handsomely (p.24)? The truth is that Andrew induced grieving customers to sign up for loans, then called these loans to foreclose on the homes. Andrew got rich by swindling widows and orphans! He became richer by buying into banks and factories, and real estate in growing Fall River. If one of his tenants received a higher salary, Andrew raised his rent. Andrew sold products from his home (p.25); he bought spoiled apple cider and sold it as vinegar. Page 34 quotes Bridget on the murders: \\"I'd be afraid to say anything at all. If I did, that terrible man that killed poor Mrs Borden might come back and kill me too.\\" What did she know and when did she know it?    Page 94 asks why Lizzie didn't burn that dress before the police searched the house. That would have left a residue in the stove. Page 107 talks about the three doors, but says nothing about cellar windows being used to get into the house. Page 124 says the assassin could go upstairs to the guest room to hide, but be discovered by Abby. The jury found Lizzie not guilty. The same lack of evidence also applies to Bridget, and Lizzie said \\"it wasn't Bridget ....\\" Robert Pinkerton says \\"an innocent person is more likely to make conflicting statements than is a guilty on.\\" (His firm was hired by Lizzie.)    Chapter 21 discusses the missing note. Could this explain why Abby went to the second floor guest room? AR Brown has a better explanation for this note. Her discovery of \\"Nemesis\\" led to her unplanned murder. Then this rage must have been directed to Andrew after he turned over that white box. The opinion of Dr Abbot (pp.200-1) seems to be political, not medical. JV Morse's answer (p.202) seems like a way to answer without saying anything. Chapter 14 questions the time of death for Abby. The fact is that Abby was last seen alive about 9:15am, her body was discovered around noon. Since she had been killed earlier than Andrew, the 90 minute estimate is dead accurate. The charts on page 205 are meaningless without indexes for time and temperature. The unscientific studies on page 206 are contradicted by Dr. Dolan's tests on the bodies. The trial testimony quoted on page 210 really means that if a stomach empties between \\"two or three hours\\" there is no estimate possible after this time. Nicole's empty stomach would put her death 3 hours after her 8pm supper. Ron's stomach should show eating between 10:30pm and 11pm (my estimate).    Chapter 16 has one of his solutions: an embezzling bank clerk who played the stock market But a white collar crime like this rules out a double murder? Was it JW Carpenter, who embezzled from Andrew's funeral business? Or maybe J Clegg? Masterton didn't solve the crime! Arnold R Brown's book provided the final solution in theory, because no one has come up with a better one. Masterton's fable violates the known facts of the case.	2003-04-14

Obviously, the four gospels and Paul's letters mention him, but since they are full of amazing miracles, we have to consider the possibility that they are not wholly reliable.  Fortunately for scholars, Jesus' existence is independently verified from the brief mention of him and his brother in the Jewish chronicler Josephus. Although Christians added interpolations to these passages in their copies of Josephus, there is a clear consensus that Josephus wrote the core stating that Jesus was a religious man crucified by the Romans. This is all discussed in considerable detail in the first volume of John Meier's exhaustive \\"A Marginal Jew.\\"<br />Robert Price has written a book that expresses his belief in \\"Jesus Agnosticism.\\"  He is agnostic not about whether Jesus was God, but whether Jesus actually existed.  So what does Price say in response to Josephus and Meier?  Absolutely nothing. So he has provided no reason why we should believe Josephus to be wrong.  That Jesus' followers wrote little about him for four decades after his death is not surprising. There weren't that many of them, most of them were illiterate and they thought the world was going to end soon. Notwithstanding this simple solution Price argues that maybe people combined ideas from Greek Cynicism, Jewish scholars, classical heroes and cults of dying and resurrected Gods and projected them into a quasi-mythical Jesus who lived decades before the Gospel version did.  In other words we are about to embark on a very complicated solution to a non-existent historical problem.  Occam's razor anyone?<br />This is compounded with several fatal problems.  (1) Inadequate sources: In search of \\"independent\\" traditions about Jesus, he spends thirty pages on a Sufi mystic versions of his sayings. The mystic lived ten centuries after Jesus, and obviously isn't independent proof of anything. Likewise Price uses dated authorities like Lord Raglan and Sir James Frazer's overstated theory of \\"dying and ressurrected Gods,\\" (the most popular cult, that of Attis, clearly developed after Jesus). Meanwhile he cites a 1937 book by the discredited Hugh J. Schonfield to try to argue that Jesus lived 100 BCE. (2) Systematic anachronism:  to show that Jesus was a Cynic, he compares verses to thoughts of Seneca and Musonius Rufus, who clearly lived after him. In searching for analogies for the empty tombs he quotes Chariton (first century CE), Longus (c. 150), Iamblichus (c.300), Philostratus (c.220) and Tatius (second century). Clearly the Gospels were not written that late, and so these Greek and Latin sources did not inspire them. (3) Confused comparative method:  there are bound to be similarities in narratives, but this does not prove a common origin. \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"King Lear,\\" are all about monarchs who die because of the perfidy of someone they trusted. But they are obviously not the same story and have no common origin. And so there is no reason to believe that a legend in which the Greek healer Asclepius healed a person while in disguise was the basis of the story of the road to Emmaus. Likewise Price compares Jesus' order \\"Let the dead bury their dead,\\" to several Cynic sayings. But he ignores the obvious difference. The cynics could care less about their corpses, while Jesus states that the Coming Kingdom of God is more important than the duty to bury one's father.<br />(4) Incoherent use of theoretical models:  Price relies on Burton Mack's theory of Jesus and the Q Community as Cynics. But he also agrees with E.P. Sanders' view that Galilee was not a place likely to be open to Cynic (or Greek) influences. Rather than concluding that Mack is wrong, he uses this to argue that Greeks came up with the Q sayings and it was incorporated (how?) into Jewish thought. Price quotes with approval William Wrede's classic account of the Messianic Secret in Mark. But Wrede argued that Mark had Jesus keep his messianic status secret because people knewthe real Jesus had never made such a claim. Such a contortion makes no sense if there was never a real Jesus to begin with. Price also ignores simpler solutions. He uses the ambiguities in the Gospels over who executed Jesus as proof that the actual event was far off in the past. He ignores the more obvious alternative: Jesus was executed by the Romans and the Gospel writers tried to get around this embarrassing fact by blaming the Jews. (5) Failure to explain the Jewish connection: all the early sources of Christianity are quite clear. The early Christians were Jews, not Greek philosophers or members of Pagan mystery cults. That Paul would come up with a theology of atonement to explain Jesus' death is one thing. But given that Jews did not expect a slain Messiash, why would he make up a crucifixion as well? Why indeed would Price's funky group of cosmopolitans try to convince the Jews that this non/barely existent Jesus was the culmination of their religion while at the same time using such ideas such as the Virgin Birth, the Incarnation and the Crucifixion they were most likely to reject? It just doesn't work.w the real Jesus had never made such a claim. Such a contortion makes no sense if there was never a real Jesus to begin with. Price also ignores simpler solutions.

This prolific writer and world-famous astronomer and TV science expert takes you on a guided tour of a place where the atmospheric pressure is terrible and the temperatures are scorching. This book is vastly different from his first book on this subject in 1954; \\"The Planet Venus\\" in which he stated the planet was in a Cambrian state and \\"will eventually develop more advanced life forms.\\" Though admittedly wrong, Moore says Venus is still a fascinating world. \\"Recent orbiting spacecraft with radar imaging systems are turning up new and intriguing information about our nearest neighbor.\\"<BR>    In the ensuing chapters, such as \\"Myth and Legends\\" Moore discusses the Maya civilization and their interest in Venus and considered her a major deity. They even developed a calendar based upon the movement of the planet. A more modern myth about Venus was Dr. Velikovsky's claim that Venus used to be comet. His 1939 book \\"Worlds In Collision\\" claimed that Venus was ejected from Jupiter and bounced around the solar system eventually settling in its near circular orbit it has today. During this game of planetary billiards Venus encountered the Earth causing a well-known biblical event; halting the Earth's spin long enough to part the Red Sea.<BR>    The fifth chapter  \\"Venus Through the Telescope\\" is by far the best section of this work. Here displayed are some beautiful drawings of Venus by 18th century astronomer Francesco Bianchini including a map to which are drawn seas and continents.    Bianchini's book was published in Latin but, according to Moore, he was insistent that it be translated into English and Springer Verlag published a version of the work. Another intriguing topic discussed here is the &quot;enlightened&quot; mountains seen by German astronomer Schroter, an observation that couldn't be confirmed by William Herschal.  They were most likely a dark patch or streak seen on Venus. Percival Lowell, famous for his theories on Mars, recorded numerous streaks on Venus. But unlike his Martian canals he felt that these were natural markings, not artificial.<BR>     Whole chapters are devoted to the Ashen light of Venus and an elusive phantom \\"moon\\". Like the young crescent moon viewed in the early evening, the dark side of the moon will be lit by Earthshine. \\"A similar effect can be seen with Venus\\" even this author has seen this effect. Having viewed it since 1934, Moore even tried an experiment to hide the bright crescent. \\"I found as a rule it could still be seen shinning on its own.\\" The belief that Venus possessed a satellite was held to be true by some 18th and 19th astronomers, but other astronomers too never verified this. Moore suggests that the \\"moon\\" may have been an uncharted star or perhaps for the earlier sightings the undiscovered planet Uranus.<BR>    And what would be a book about Venus without mentioning the big attraction coming up next years; the transit of Venus. Transits are rare, once in over a century, but are seen in pairs, separated by eight years. Discussed here are transits to come and Moore adds, \\"go forward to the year 3818 and they'll be a transit on Christmas Day.\\" <BR>    The book is loaded with interesting facts and tidbits. There are allot of translations of historical astronomical works along with quotations through out the book. It has a gallery of photos from recent flybys and telescope and spectroscope views, which, along with computer-generated illustrations, help depict the latest ideas of what Venus looks like. Illustrations by Paul Doherty are realistic and exquisite. Moore ends the book with a \\"visual\\" descent through the clouds and down to the surface, soaring over peaks and deep craters.<BR>    The book \\"Venus\\" is quite enjoyable to read and to refer too. It would probablysit well with future young astronomers (8th grade level &amp; up) that are truly interested in the planets, particularly Venus.	2003-04-05

I bought this book when I discovered that there is very dramatic difference between the two, and that what I was doing would not necessarily achieve the goals I desired.  This review will be more of a description of my experience and understanding with the Big Beyond Belief system before and after having used it for several weeks.<br />I am a 26-year-old male.  I stand at 5'11\\" and 174 lbs, 12-14% body fat and I have a very ectomorph body type (not exactly ideal for a body builder).  My chest circumference is only about 40\\", my arms 14.5\\", my mid-thighs 21\\", with a waist of about 34.5\\". However, I am very strong for my size!<br />Most recently, I was doing a routine where only a single body part would be emphasized on a single day (i.e. Chest-Monday, Legs-Tuesday, Arms-Wednesday, etc... etc...).  Multiple exercises would be used to target the same muscle groups in different ways.  However, missing a single day of working out would put you almost TWO WHOLE WEEKS BEHIND from one given workout and the next.  As a result, my development was very disproportionate, and irregular.<br />Now with Big Beyond Belief (BBB), you work nearly every body part 3 times per week.  The purpose of this is based on the Physiological fact that Muscle tissue begins to atrophy within 72 after your most recent workout of that body part (my wife is completing her Doctorates in Physical Therapy, and she has verified this fact for me).<br />Furthermore, the initially prescribed system in BBB oscillates the volume and intensity both within the weeks and throughout the weeks, (you will have to purchase the book to see how it is specifically done).  However, the result ensures that your body is never allowed to fully adapt to the specific stress applied, while simultaneously preventing you from entering into a state of chronic over-training.  The author describes this as the optimal training zone (a balance between over and under training). <br />Each work out is supposed to last no longer than 45 min. The author cites Bulgarian studies that indicate a significant loss of testosterone in the blood after 35-45 min of serious weight lifting.  Believe me...this program is very serious.  <br />If you are like me, and are not used to working out multiple body parts, much less your entire body in a single day, I would seriously recommend the Preconditioning Workout supplied by the author.<br />Though I used to workout 6 days per week, 1 ½ to 2 hours per day; I found the 45 min, four days per week workouts much more difficult.  Frequently while using BBB, following my workouts, I would go home and pass out on the couch for a couple hours.  Though I work out at 5 am in the morning, I had never experienced this level of total fatigue before.  In an effort to counter this level of exhaustion, I increased my hours of sleep from 7 to 9 hours per night.  Finally, I was not passing out at home or in class.  <br />By the end of my second week, I still had not adapted to this new type of training and I started to feel nauseous about 50% of the way through my workout.  As a result, I have decided to start over, and begin with the preconditioning workout before I start the prescribed routine.<br />However, I am very encouraged by the fact that some (very large) body builders had noticed growth development and toning in my overall physique.  They complemented me on it and asked which supplements I was taking.  I just replied, \\"No new supplements, just a new killer routine!\\"<br />When I get further along in my training, I will update this review, to help you decide whether Big Beyond Belief is for you.  So far, I am very impressed, but also very tired.  To all those huge monster Body Builders out there, \\"I may not have the nuts just yet to complete the program, but I'm sure as hell, trying hard!\\"<br />That is what it takes, trying hard as hell.	2003-04-05

The 100 short \\"letters from the dead\\" concerning the ease of their passing and their new consciousness are fascinating and emotionally moving. They convincingly reflect very different personalities, time periods and even to some extent handwriting styles. The common theme or purpose is to banish the common fear of death. The messages are profound, deep in meaning and beautifully written. The quality of these writings towers over the bulk of contemporary \\"channeled\\" literature. <BR>   My instinctive reaction was that these communications were the authentic statements of real, unique personages from beyond physical death. Emotionally convincing, this wonderful book would nevertheless seem to be mainly valuable to those who already believe in an afterlife to some extent, but need reassurance. Objectively and intellectually the material is not completely convincing because of the apparently deliberate lack of details that could be verified. Also, there is a subtle sort of \\"sameness\\" to the language , including the prevalence of short, choppy sentences even from 19th and early 20th century people where the typical contemporary printed language was wordy and long-winded. <BR>   Paradoxically, the writing in many of the messages seems too beautiful and eloquent in too similar a way to be produced by ordinary persons with average education from the many time periods in the last two centuries. On the other hand, especially eloquent souls could have been chosen for this project, and anyway souls could be expected to be more eloquent than human beings. Also, these minor troubling factors could simply be due to the influence of the  medium's own personality on the transmission of psychically derived information.  <BR>    A minimum objective assessment is that this COULD have been<BR>produced by unconscious sub-personalities of the medium informed by the medium's own concept of afterlife and the reading of many previous mediumistic communications in the 20th century psychic literature. But is such a reductionist explanation believable?  It boggles the mind that one brain could have at any level of consciousness such implied extreme brilliance,<BR>creativity and cleverness. <BR>   Ultimately I have to fall back to my initial intuitive reaction that this is the real thing - fascinating, wonderful and profound. I highly recommend this unique book to true believers, wish-to-believers and even open-minded skeptics who feel their heart.	2003-03-29
US	41686219	ROBUC5IIQU9WJ	037550608X	102103275	Resistance and Betrayal: The Death and Life of the Greatest Hero of the French Resistance	Books	2	26	30	N	N	This author has an ulterior agenda	I was enthusiastic when I found this book since English books on Resistance are few, and books about Moulin are very rare. But I was to be disappointed.<br />The author claims to seek the real man behind the legend of Jean Moulin, who became the symbol of French Resistance, and it is a very worthwhile objective indeed except that it is impossible. So after he admits that very little is known about Moulin, he proceeds to fill these unknowns with conjectures built on conjectures, and it soon becomes clear that the purpose of this book is not to find the human and real Moulin, but to discredit the left-wing of Resistance at his expense.<br />Jean Moulin is French JFK. Now universally admired, he is shadowed by circumstances of his betrayal and death, and numerous conspiracy theories have crept up. Only difference is: here in America, a crackpot theory that LBJ is behind the plot wouldn't get any ink in the mainstream. But in France, most ridiculous assertions are taken seriously because Moulin is used by both the right and left wing to discredit one another. So in recent years, it has been alleged that Moulin is a Soviet agent, an OSS(pre-CIA) agent, an anti-Gaullist, etc with the most tenuous \\"evidence\\". While Moulin has not yet been accused of being a Nazi mole, the author insinuates possibility that Moulin betrayed himself (along with 7 other Resistance leaders) in this book. So finally, the whole ground is covered.<br />His right-wing tendencies and contempt toward the Republic and all it stands for is quite obvious from the first pages and color the whole presentation. His most assertions are easily refutable by anyone familiar with Resistance history, but unfortunately this book is most likely to be the first book on Resistance to most of readers, and that's why I'm getting riled.<br />I'll give just a few of many examples.<br />Simply put, the author's assertion that the communist party is most likely betrayer of Moulin just doesn't hold water. I don't subscribeto the conspiracy theory that royalists betrayed Moulin either, but at least that theory has some basis if only tenuous one. So in order to bolster his theory, the author strives to make Moulin a crypto-communist, which is solely based on Moulin's connection to Pierre Cot.<br />The author makes a big deal of Moulin's contact with Cot's associates after the Fall of France. Considering that Moulin spent most of his career in local governments and his only stint in national politics was with Cot in Air Ministry, it is not surprising that Moulin met Cot's associates for informations on resistance organizations nationwide. But to the author's mind, this is a proof that Moulin was interested only in communist organizations. The author admits that even if all his assertions turn out to be true (and they are not) that it doesn't mean that Moulin was a communist. However, later in the book, he flatout states that Moulin was more concerned with the future of Soviet Union than France.<br />There is no doubt that Mouin was a left-wing republican, sympathetic to the cause of Spanish republic. He even smuggled French aircrafts to Spanish republic to aid their cause (in what is close to our Iran-Contra scandal). However, we simply cannot know what Moulin's opinion was regarding communism and Soveit Union at the time. What is definitely known is that when Germany and Soviet Union signed Non-Aggression Pact, Moulin as a prefect, clamped down on the communists. When Vichy government decreed anti-Jewish laws, Moulin dragged his feet in enforcing it and interned no one, but when it came to communists, he showed less reluctance.<br />The author mentions these facts, as well as the fact that a Soviet informer reportedly incorrectly that Moulin was an OSS informer, but they are not taken into account when he insinuates that Moulin provided sensitive information to Soviet Union. Nor does he find it contraditory to claim that this Soviet informer was close associate of Moulin.<br />Secondly, the author is skeptical of veracity of biographical or personal accounts - including Moulin's - and rightly so, yet he loses objectivity when it comes to negative accounts made by Henri Frenay This is even more surprising since these accounts are from Frenay's book that was specifically written to discredit Moulin long after Moulin's death.<br />No same courtesy is shown to Moulin. The author admits that Moulin's accounts (about his time as a prefect) are all true in the areas that can be verified by facts. But when it come to areas that can't be verified, like what went on in Moulin's mind when he cut his throat, the author is skeptical and ready to assume the worst.<br />I could go on and on. And maybe I will when I finish the book, if only because this book is a most widely available book on Moulin, and that's a shame.	2003-03-26

You will quickly notice that the reviews give the book either five stars or one star (there are two with three stars, but they are the exceptions).  Those who give the book five stars discuss the content of the book while those who give it one star disparage the author.  A few of them also call the book a pack of lies, but don't give examples, except for one.  A reader from St. Paul Minnesota said: \\"Unlike what Mr. Patterson here says, the President doesn't carry around the launch codes. One of his aides does that, in a briefcase. So if the codes were lost, it wasn't President Clinton that lost them. This is just one of the many untruths to be found in this book.\\"<br />The BBC press on April 26, 1999, published an article entitled \\"World: Americas Clinton drops nuclear football.\\"  It details how President Clinton did in fact leave behind the nuclear football--as well as the aide it was attached to.  \\"A Reader\\" is clearly not apprised of the facts, and his opinioon may be discounted as uninformed.  <br />Also, reviewer Edwin Carr from Boston on March 21 said: \\"a distinguished officer like himself, who took the same oath that I did, to protect and serve an American President and maintain his confidences and protect the job and position of the President of the United States, could fail the oath he swore to protect. Buzz should be ashamed that he has betrayed the confidence of all of us who were privileged to serve a President.  He betrayed his leader, who he chose to serve. He betrayed his country for divulging secrets he swore to protect.\\"<br />Mr. Carr should be reminded that the consitutional oath he refers to is an oath to the people of the United States and not to one specific leader.  Only leaders like Saddam require an oath to a specific leader, and that it is Clinton who betrayed his country and HIS oath.  Patterson is merely giving details.<br />In conclusion, I would suggest you do yourself a favor: buy this book and use the web to verify the allegations contained in it.  You will quickly learn that for what can be verified, the writer is right on the money.	2003-03-26

I found the approach unique, apparently written from a mathematician's point of view. But I was led to wonder about the accuracy of some of the material in the book, particularly of thought experiments that cannot be done in real life and which therefore cannot be positively verified or denied experimentally. For example, who is going to put clocks all over the solar system and then go to every planet to check their readings? But then, other books do the same thing, for example, asking the reader to imagine riding on a train travelling at eighty percent of the speed of light.<br />After looking at various mentions of this title around the Web (as a phrase in Google advanced search), I have found mostly positive comments, including one from a mathematician (!) in Alabama and another from an educational association in Arizona. These experts have recommended this book as good reading for their students. One fellow dismissed the book because he turned to a page and found some mention of UFOs, but confessed that he hadn't actually read the book yet.<br />Gibilisco's approach differs rather dramatically from most other relativity books because it is neither highfalutin nor silly. The style is, for the most part, clear. I think the explanations of simultaneity are a little hard to understand and could be misleading to some readers. Gibilisco could do a better job of explaining the relativity of simultaneity among objects in relative motion. It would be nice to have more discussion about paradoxes associated with Special Relativity. An updated edition could clarify some of these issues and also address the question, &quot;Can anything travel faster than the speed of light in free space?&quot;	2003-03-25
US	49494817	R2HAV0K85EH0FT	0029290406	953890943	Science And Human Behavior	Books	3	26	70	N	N	The weaknesses of behaviorism are apparent here	BF's Skinner's early work in operant conditioning through laboratory research on animals is generally regarded as a lasting and significant contribution to science and psychology. However, Skinner's works on human behavior, including this one, attempt to generalize to all human behavior the model he developed and used to predict and control animal behavior under highly controlled conditions.<br />In Science and Human Behavior, Skinner repeatedly offers, as the reason for a given behavior's occurrence, the explanation that it is \\"reinforced,\\" and advocates that we abandon the traditional discourse used to explain human behavior through reference to intention, desire, will, thoughts, and feelings. Instead, Skinner argues that a science of behavior can improve upon such explanations by using the jargon of operant conditioning theory.<br />In operant conditioning theory, \\"reinforcement\\" is the process whereby a behavior is strengthened by the process of associating it with a consequence, and Skinner shows little regard for the precise technical meaning of this word when he makes many uses of this term and its derivations (reinforce, reinforcer, reinforcing). For example, he writes the following: \\"Education is a profession, the members of which engage in education primarily because of economic reinforcement.\\" It is hard to see what this assertion means, as the behavioral antecedents to \\"economic reinforcement\\" that constitute the \\"profession\\" of \\"education\\" remain undefined. Furthermore, such an assertion is comically out of touch with the reality that many teachers, who could make much more money in other professions, might object to having their primary motive for teaching characterized this way. Perhaps what is meant here is that \\"economic reinforcement\\" (money) strengthens the \\"behavior\\" of teaching more efficiently than any other reinforcer, in which case it seems that Skinner is applying a truism-that people work when they get paid for it, and stop working when they don't. Whatever the case, such statements as this one, which litter this book, seem remarkably short of any scientific authority or interest.<br />One might argue that since virtually all of the haphazardly placed illustrative applications of his jargon to actual human behavior are as brief and platitudinous as the one mentioned, they shouldn't be taken literally, but seen as rhetorical devices in service of explaining his conceptual model. But some might wish that Skinner took seriously the burden of demonstrating that what he asserts is both verified by the scientific method, and a non-trivial improvement on what is already known. In absence of either, this book is mostly an amusing glimpse at an outdated approach to psychology that simply has not delivered on its promise to find mechanisms for the effective control of human behavior, unless you count its contribution to the management of prisons, mental hospitals, and other highly controlled environments that approximate the inhumane conditions under which Skinner's lab rats lived.<br />Therefore, if you are interested, like me, in understanding the roots of Skinner's influence and an introduction to how he applies his basic concepts to human behavior, this book is a very profitable read. If you are looking for a work of actual scientific merit, this book has little to recommend.	2003-03-23

There is great emphasise on finding a therapist, and the book is filled with warnings on \\"taking things gently\\". Well, if you have experianced sexual abuse, you'll know yourself, that living through each day is certainly not \\"gentle\\". It's certainly not as if one can just take a break from their suffering and chaos, and say \\"Oh gee, perhaps it's time to relax a little and take a break from my pain for an hour\\". This book assumes that suffering is something we do in our spare time while we are not at work, or while the kids are out. Personally, I question the credit of anyone who says they are recovering form trauma, but yet still manages to find time to have a peaceful coffee with friends after their meditation session. Yikes! Life after abuse is just not that sweet!<br />To me, I was unable to relate to this book. It just didn't seem to do justice to the chaotic confused nightmare that consitutes my life. It seems as if sexual abuse suffering has become a fashionble hobby! Many places on the internet have become like sexual abuse social clubs, with people competeing for the best symptoms and the worst experiances. Real sufferers certainly do not have the time to play such stupid games. They are far too busy with their consuming pain to do this. This book made me feel very alien to what it believes a sufferer \\"should\\" be.<br />As for the recovered memory debate. This is my 2 cents worth: Myself, I have very little recollection of the abuse I experianced. Although it has been verified physically (when I was raped, I was found bleeding). I have no desire to go chasing memories that my mind does not want to recall, and I am wary of any book that puts such extreme emphasis on the importance ofremembering.<BR>Only you yourself can tell you if you have been abused. You don't need a book for that.<br />My last words on this book: If you are after some comforting words, you may enjoy this. But myself, I am after something challanging and lasting. Something confronting, that gives me insight into exactly why I am feeling this way. I don't want to hear: \\"You been abused so of course you will have problems with the realtionship between strength and weakness\\"... I want to understand WHY my life has evolved this way... Exactly HOW did the abuse cause this struggle.<BR>I needed a much stronger book than this.<br />But if you are such a sensitive person that you need to be warned to take a break when you can't handle things, and to ring up a therapist when you are suicidal (as if you need to be locked away in a ward so you don't \\"hurt yourself\\". Geez, whatever happened to a person's right to chose what happens to their own life?). And if you're one of those people that need the words \\"S*xual abuse\\" blocked out of your websites so that you can read it without breaking apart; Then you'd possibly enjoy this. Possibly, though, you just ought to take a good lay down too.	2003-03-21

This is evident by the fact that the author often admits that he had problems remembering what he had done. If an overall design blueprints/metaphors had existed, he wouldn't have had this problem.  <BR> <BR>I assume that the author decided he would tackle his OS project and then get on with his life. In other words, let's get this done and then never, NEVER, look back (history seems to have verified this: the author wrote the OS in the early 1990s and then left MMURTL at the station with bus fair in the mid 1990s). There was no home-page on the internet, nor promoter outside of SAMs publishing. <br />MMURTL did not take off. The hundreds of hours that the author spent building tools and wading around in the dark have been, for all intensive purposes, lost. All that remains is a jumbled book, as a testimony to one man's urge to climb a mountain &quot;because it's there.&quot;<br />Had Richard involved other people and Open-Sourced his creation, the man-power necessary to take MMURTL out of its confusing infantile state may have been available. Instead, Richard decided to build MMURTL utilizing a software team consisting of one person, and the rest is history.<br />Those readers who want to dig into OS internals should defer to Linux. Unlike MMURTL, Linux is a &quot;live&quot; system (which admins actually use) with all the features you would expect in an enterprise OS. Linux has a sane design, does a sufficient job of isolating hardware specifics, and information/support can be located at dozens of web-sites. Best of all, Linus and his cast of thousands have wrapped the assembly code and given it a structural underpinning.<br />At the end of the day, thisbook is a nice concept whose execution never really followed through. There may be one or two useful snippets of code, but I wouldn't invest 6 months of my life to become a MMURTL fanatic. History and evolution were the judges and Linux is the winner.	2003-03-14

US	41580389	R1WR8CKC5HWQB7	1556434375	740878826	The Nutrition Solution: A Guide to Your Metabolic Type	Books	5	295	302	N	Y	Metabolic typing made practical	A key tenet of Dr Kristal's book is that no specific diet is right for everybody and that one's optimal diet can be determined by metabolic typing. His book builds upon information slowly developed over more than 40 years by a variety of practitioners. Another key tenet is that a healthy body has an ideal blood pH of 7.46, varying only within a narrow range. One of Dr Kristal's personal contributions is the development of simple and inexpensive quantitative procedures to determine a person's blood pH and metabolic type. They avoid the previous invasive taking of large venous blood samples over 14 hours by standard phlebotomy techniques. Instead he takes 4 drop-size blood samples from the finger over about 2 hours during a modified fasting glucose challenge test. He also tests samples of urine and saliva, measures blood pressure and pulse, both standing and lying down, respiration rate, time of holding one's breath, body fat, and weight. He also records self-reported observations at specific times during the glucose challenge, and takes a short personal history. The book explains how this information is used.<br />While the reason is currently unknown, each individual has a dominant mechanism controlling their metabolism. The two most fundamantal control mechanisms that regulate blood pH are the rate of oxidation and the actions of the autonomic nervous system. Each of these two metabolic types has two sub-types: fast or slow oxidative-dominant, and sympathetic or parasympathetic autonomic-dominant. From the test information, one's dominant metabolic sub-type can be determined, which then determines the optimum diet.<br />A major discovery is that most food items will have opposite effects on the blood pH of the major metabolic types, oxidative and autonomic. A food or drink that acidifies the blood of one type will alkalize the blood of the other. This is also true for many vitamin and mineral supplements. This knowledge, which has been verified by tests and clinical results, runs counter to both  orthodox and alternative medical beliefs. <br />Fast oxidizers and parasympathetic autonomics have blood that is too acid; slow oxidizers and parasympathetic autonomics have blood that is too alkaline. Because of the opposite effects mentioned above, nutrients are catagorized as Group I for slow oxidizers and sympathetics and Group II for fast oxidizers and parasympathetics. To greatly oversimplify (read the book for details), Group I people should have a diet dominated by complex carbohydrates and Group II should have a diet dominated by protein and fat. Each type emphasizes specific vegetables, fruits, and proteins. Thus no popular weight-loss diet can work for everybody, but by chance may work for some.<br />Using vitamin C as an example, ascorbic acid will acidfy oxidative metabolic types and alkalize autonomic types, while calcium ascorbate does the opposite. Group I requires the ascorbic acid form because it acidfies the slow oxidizer, but alkalizes the sympathetic. Group II requires the calcium ascorbate form because it alkalizes the fast oxidizer and acidifies the parasympathetic. Among foods, brocolli is a Group I food and cauliflower is a Group II food. Again, see the book for details.<br />The first three chapters of the book cover the theory and practice of metabolic typing. The next four cover weight control and other health issues; cancer (Dr Kristal recently discovered that nearly 80% of his clients presenting with cancer were Group I, and nearly 80% presenting with diabetes were Group II); general nutritional information; and dental toxicity (his training was as a dentist). The book includes an appendix explaining the details of metabolic typing, and another in which an MD examines cancer and metabolic typing.<br />The book discusses literature published in 2002. The authors acknowledge when they don't know the answer to some issue, and they discuss rate of success. When I was typed, Dr Kristal discovered that I was insulin resistant and on the verge of being diabetic. My HMO had not found this.

This writer doesn't. He quotes doctors and acknowledges their help in writing this book. He says this book isn't about alternative medicine, because there is no alternative to medicine in a health emergency and nobody should try to do diagnosis for him- or herself. Nonetheless, he recommends chiropractors, herbalists, massage therapists, aroma therapists, homeopaths and other kinds of healing practitioners for specific diseases. <br />This book discusses lots of diseases that can be cured with non-medical means. Thas is, they can be treated with non-medical means once a health professional, meaning a doctor, has confirmed that you are treating the right disease. Most of the thousands of recommendations in this book are products you can use and practices you can do entirely on your own. Unlike some writers who seem to know their science, this author doesn't just recommend treatments that have stacks and stacks of scientific literature to back them up. If it has been verified that a food or mineral or vitamin or herb works, and doesn't have side effects, and isn't toxic, but medical science doesn't completely understand it yet (or hasn't even tried to understand it yet), and doesn't interfere with a medication you have chosen to take (there's a comprehensive list of interactions), this author says why not use it. Just use  the product knowing this up front. He mentions healing practices that aren't in any other book but have worked in his own experience. On the other hand, the author says he wrote this book after reviewing 10,000 scientific articles. he cites thousands of them, some of them published as recently as late 2002. This writer understands and respects doctors and medical science but he obviously isn't a slave to them.<br />I'll admit my personal bias. I have known this author for many years. He helps many people. As for this specific book, I haven't had time to try but one of his recommendations-but I got over my cold in a day and a half by taking the right combination of food and vitamin C so if need be, I'll consult this book again. I don't think you can go wrong by buying it.	2003-03-10

Stick to it, and don't be led astray by Wall Street's fashions, illusions, and its constant chase after that fast dollar.<br />Investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. After all, you are neither right or wrong when the market disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right. True, there is safety in growth and some of us will go as far as to declare that there can be no real safety except in growth. But these sound to me like slogans than scientifically formulated and verified propositions. A case can be made for putting all your growth eggs in the best or relatively few best baskets.<br />If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will undervalue - relatively, at least - companies that are out of favor because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature. Focus on larger companies, for 2 reasons: First they have the resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adversity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market is likely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement shown.<br />Let me emphasize that it does not take a genius or even a superior talent to be successful as a value analyst. What it needs is, first, reasonably good intelligence; second, sound principles of operation; third, and most important, firmness of character.<br />Now, let me close with a few words of counsel from an 80-year-old veteran of many a bull and many a bear market. Do those things as analyst that you know you can do well, and only those things. If you're really good at picking stocks most likely to succeed in the next 12 months, base your work on that. If you can foretell the next important development in the technology, then concentrate on that activity, But in each case, you must prove yourself by honest, no-bluffing self examination and by continuous testing of performance that you have what it takes to produce worthwhile results.<br />[IF YOU GET THROUGH THE ABOVE YEARNING FOR MORE, THEN THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.

The choice of the factor million million is NOT arbitrary. It is based off of the redshift of cosmic background radiation between quark confinement and approximately the present. It is also related to the change in temperature from quark confinement to the present. I double-checked this temperature change in \\"Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics: Volume II (3rd Edition)\\".    Actual review: this book is great. As a christian, I had fears when I began reading it. I see this fear when evolution is mentioned in my church. It is the fear that your entire life is based on something that doesn't agree with the facts, that you have been missing the truth.    But in reading it, my faith in the Bible is stronger than it has ever been. It is true what he says: an understanding of the works of God comes not only from the Bible, but from a firm understanding of science. Don't blink at the facts. Read this book and understand why there is no reason for conflict between two of God's greatest creations.    ----    6 years later (2009)...    This review has apparently been helpful to so many people that it is now the top-rated review. I am honored and grateful that so many people found affinity with what I said.    This also happened to my review of Schroeder's other book, The Hidden Face of God. However, like that review, I am probably about to lose my spot as the top-rated review because I feel an overriding responsibility to be honest.     The Science of God was an important book for me. It got me seriously thinking about science and evidence. It is what propelled me to reach beyond the small religious world I had relegated myself to and to start talking seriously to other people about the truth. I believed Schroeder's arguments were the key to uniting science and the Bible.    However, after years of studying, researching, thinking, and discussing, I no longer agree with the arguments I presented above in support of the book.    1 REDSHIFT  It is true that the choice of the factor million million (10^12) is not *completely* arbitrary. It is indeed based off of the redshift of cosmic background radiation between quark confinement and the present.     But there is a problem.    There were 3 primary eras during the big bang. The GUT era (10^32 to 10^27). The Hadron era (10^27 to 10^12). And the Lepton era (10^12 to 10^10). Amazing things were happening to quarks and other sub-atomic particles in all of these eras.     Now here is the punch-line: there is no scientific reason to select the end of the Hadron era (10^12) as the time when the universe \\"really\\" started. The only plausible reason I can think for selecting this temperature is that Schroeder wanted his calculations to work out. And so he personally (and subjectively) selected that temperature.    This can all be verified from the same diagram I used 6 years ago: \\"Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics: Volume II (3rd Edition)\\". Page 1162, Figure 45-24.    2 SCIENCE AND THE BIBLE  After years of study and thought, I can no longer agree that Science and The Bible are compatible. The Bible was created by religion. And science was created by the scientific method.    Now, let me start by saying that there are two very important things that science and religion agree about:     1) There is truth  2) We can find that truth    That is, there is a true reality behind this existence and there are ways that we can know about the greater truths of this reality. We can know about things that we can't even see with our own eyes. These truths can be revealed to us.    But there is also one very important thing that science and religion disagree about. And that is HOW these truths will be revealed.     A) According to religion's rules, truths about the universe can simply be *asserted* and believed because they feel right to the individual or because someone else asserted them a long time ago. According to religion, once a statement is asserted about the universe (e.g. \\"God exists\\"), that statement can be treated as THE truth and can never be questioned without destroying the religion.    B) According to science's rules, truths about the universe can only be discovered through careful and thorough study of external evidence. According to science, when a statement is believed about the universe (e.g. \\"time is absolute\\"), that statement can and should be questioned. If external evidence causes us to doubt that statement, science becomes stronger because it receives new answers.    Here is the conflict: both science and religion are trying to define the same universe simultaneously. These two rule-sets directly contradict each other.     If scientists tried to discover truths using rule-set (A), there would be no science. Just a bunch of warring cultural opinions, like todays world religions. But because they discover truths using rule-set (B), science is unified. There is a consensus. In science, we all believe the same things about reality because what we believe is not based on personal feelings (of either ourselves or people who lived thousands of years ago): it is based on external evidence that can be verified at any time.    I applaud Schroder for supporting evolution and the big bang. But when it comes to the topics of God and the Bible, he stops thinking like a scientist.     He is no longer asking: \\"What does the evidence say? What does it motivate us to believe is true?\\" He is now asking: \\"How can I present the evidence in a way that it will appear to support my personal beliefs, which I was not motivated to believe in by evidence?\\"	2003-03-06

This book, starts out as a pretty dry read concerning the physics of time travel.  This is alright, since the concept is pretty deep, but is better covered by a physicist like Paul Davies, in his book &quot;About Time&quot;.  The science part reads like a college term paper rather than an interesting portrayal of the science.  Then again, we're not buying it to learn about Einstein, are we?  No, we want to see about time travel!<BR>Once past the science stuff, we begin to see what 'paranormal' or unexplained events may indicate time travellers.  U.F.O.'s is a common theme here, although I'm surprised Childress, who does seem to discuss everything, didn't talk about people purportedly appearing from nowhere.  These cases are well documented, and certainly related to the idea of 'time travel'.  That aside, he displays some nice photographic and illustrated documentation of U.F.O.'s, starting with the late 19th century.  This continues, including Rastafarian Time Travellers.  It goes on into the Philidelphia Experiment and how it may relate to time travel.  Then, into some people's unfounded claims of either a.) being a time traveller b.) channeling time travellers c.) finding time capsules supposedly left by time travellers, etc.  The section on 'Seth' (of 'Seth Speaks' fame) was particularly painful, nearly equal to the lengthy babblings concerning the 'Wingmakers', (look it up on the internet).  Later, the book goes into some patents, and ends up with an excellent re-iteration of an actual, verified teleportation performed in California-perhaps the only truly verifiable evidence in this book.  <BR>Aside from these difficulties, it really has quite a few photographs and drawings of time machines, either patent ideas or left by 'time travellers'.  A few amusing cartoons are included, and it does go into depth (as much as is possible) to speculation of actual work on space-time related projects.  Fun to read?  Read Well's 'Time Machine' for that (which I was surprisedand disappointed Childress did not find some connection to allow him to speculate Wells was writing from first-hand experience).  It is a nice collection of the 'time travel' theories, ideas, and purported events in existence to the public today, and for that it is worth a purchase.	2003-03-05

This is an excellent and balanced overview of the Soviet-German war of 1941-1945. Overy uses the very best information available to give a person an excellent introduction to this titanic struggle. <br />The Eastern Front of WWII is a complicated and diverse subject, a victim of the Cold War, this largest struggle in human history is as hard to navigate as a minefield. Misinformation is not uncommon from historians pre-1991 from both East and West. Not until recently has many myths and legends been verified or dismissed, only after the fall of Communism in Europe could historian truly start to make ground breaking research on the Eastern Front of WWII. <br />What Overy does in Russias War is give us a great tour of the Eastern Front and the people and places that are center point to the event. This is not a complete history, actually this is only a good introduction to the war, but is great for both beginning interest in the war and for quick reference for seasoned WWII researchers.  He shows us the great sacrifice the people of the USSR made to defeat Nazi Germany, he also gives us a glimpse at how futile it was when their own Government was not much better then the enemy.

It is fascinating to think that Old World travelers somehow managed to reach the New World long before the time of Columbus.  Phoenicians came to Vermont where they dedicated a building to the sun god Bel. Druids and Celts also landed in New England. Egyptians visited eastern Canada. In his book, Fell proposes scores of examples of trans-oceanic visitations.<br />Though it does capture the imagination,  I would like to mention that I have done a more thorough study of one of Fell's examples and found that he claims much, but can really prove little. On page 310, Fell writes about the Los Lunas Decalogue. Fell says that the script is like the Moabite Stone which he dates to about 1000 BCE. Patina tests show that the writing is to be dated 500 to 2000 years BP (before the present). Also Fell says that the _punctuation_ matches Greek manuscripts such as Codex Sinaiticus.<br />In response I would first say that the reason that paleography can be used to date a writing is because scripts are used at a particular time in history and then fade out of use. So if Fell finds that the script of the Los Lunas Decalogue is like the Moabite Stone, then he is dating it to sometime around 1000 BCE. Second, I would say that patina tests are notorious for offering older dates than can be verified by other tests. Even so the patina tests on the Los Lunas Decalogue managed to date the writing to only 2000 years BP. Of course this mismatches the paleographical dating by almost a thousand years. Third, I find that the _punctuation_ of the Los Lunas Decalogue includes dots at the ends of sentences which we call periods. Looking at high resolution pictures of the Dead Sea Scrolls shows that at their<br />time Hebrew did not use dots as markers for the end of a sentence.<br />Did Fell reach his conclusions for his scores of other examples based upon such a poor foundation? Though I have not done such indepth research on all of Fell's examples, I would say yes. So although it captures the imagination to think that Old World travelers came to the New World long before the time of Columbus, Leif Ericsson looks like as good as it gets.l of Fell's examples, I would say yes.

They are apparently willing to accept the innate physical differences of the various races: the oriental eye-fold of the Asian, the longer limbs and typical steatopygia of the African, and the various skin color differences--and probably they will even acknowledge the undeniable genetically generated athletic prowess of African, but--heaven forbid!--one should never acknowledge that there may be racial mental propensities as well!<br /><br />Pinker points out that both nature and nurture come into play in forming the individual human being, as well as the culture within which he dwells.<br /><br />The social \\"sciences\\" ignore the formative realities of human existence because it is \\"politically incorrect\\" to do so these days.  A pseudo-scientific version of \\"All men are created equal,\\" which in the Declaration of Independence related to their position in the eyes of God, not their physical or mental capacities, which would have been an asinine assumption.<br /><br />In so doing they are blind to the facts, and even distort them purposely on occasion, as did Margaret Mead in her \\"studies\\" of Pacific Islanders in which she clearly falsified their sexual and child-rearing practices to make her point, as has been demonstrated in more recent studies of the same peoples, and verified by some of the very subjects of her work, who laughed at her statements.<br /><br />Until the social sciences clean up their act and face reality, their hopes for status as a true science will never be established, and they will continue to be viewed with amusement, not only by practitioners of the true sciences, who measure and are able to replicate their theories, but by the well-informed layman as well.<br /><br />Joseph Pierrees, which would have been an asinine assumption.<br /><br />In so doing they are blind to the facts, and even distort them purposely on occasion, as did Margaret Mead in her \\"studies\\" of Pacific Islanders in which she clearly falsified their sexual and child-rearing practices to make her point, as has been demonstrated in more recent studies of the same peoples, and verified by some of the very subjects of her work, who laughed at her statements.<br /><br />Until the social sciences clean up their act and face reality, their hopes for status as a true science will never be established, and they will continue to be viewed with amusement, not only by practitioners of the true sciences, who measure and are able to replicate their theories, but by the well-informed layman as well.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br />	2003-02-21
US	47914705	R2HM2ID8FBAOE	0195073401	680945686	Microeconomic Theory	Books	1	45	68	N	N	Style over Substance	This book does an excellent job of representing modern economic theory, or to put it more clearly, it represents all that is wrong with modern economic theory. At very best, economic theory now consists largely of commonsense propositions that academics translate into the least comprehensible form. At worst, modern economic theory dwells entirely on pure thought experiments. Such thought experiments are misleading and inaccurate because of their focus on equilibrium conditions (i.e. the solution values to systems of equations). This is not to say that the contents of this book are completely detached from reality. People do react to incentives in much the same way as described in this book. But people do not ever attain so called \\"equilibrium conditions\\".<br /><br />The basic incentive issues in economics are actually quite easy to sort out. Many undergraduate textbooks do just fine explaining incentive issues in economics using verbal logic. Instead of clear and concise verbal logic that most anyone can understand, Mas Colel, Whinston and Green employ sophisticated math models. Why?<br /><br />I have heard many arguments in favor of this approach. `Verbal logic is not logical'. `The verbal approach is too easy'. `You can only understand economics using math'. `Math models are really cool'. `Math is formal'. `You must learn the tools of mathematical analysis so you can read professional journals'.<br /><br />The fact if the matter is that one can depict complex concepts either with words or with math. Math does not necessarily deliver the right answers. Some math models `prove' that markets are efficient, others `prove' that markets fail. This proves only that some math models must be dead wrong. As for formalism, this is an application of the fallacy of style. The validity of any idea never depends upon the manner in which we present it. As for reading journals, the argument that we must learn math modeling because we cannot read journal without it begs the question. Why do we need complex math models in journals?<br /><br />We do not. Logic is logic, verbal or mathematical. Of course, verbal presentations can be flawed too, but anyone who dismisses the verbal approach for this commits the fallacy of false comparisons. There are bad uses of math too. The verbal approach is superior because more people can understand it more easily. The `formal' approach in this book also tends to distract academics from real issues. The notion of competitive equilibrium is a mere thought experiment that has absolutely no relevance to the real world. Yet, many economists focus their attention on constructing ever more sophisticated Walrasian thought experiments. What does this accomplish?<br /><br />Unfortunately, many enter the economics profession simply because they have fun solving systems of mathematical equations. They like solving math models for the same reasons that others like solving cross word puzzles- it's a game! For others, constructing math models is a contest to see who can perform the most spectacular intellectual gymnastics. Rather than being formal and professional, the approach that this book takes to economics represents a juvenile attitude whereby real economic analysis is set aside so that math obsessed \\"economists\\" can engage in a contest to see who can devise the most elegant math model. As Milton Friedman put it recently, economists now use math to impress rather than to inform.<br /><br />This book reveals the sad fact that many economists are doing work that is worthless. This is a sad fact because economics is very important. Things are better with empirical economics- there is some good economic history and econometrics out there. Obsession with math modeling has made current theoretical economics irrelevant, except to those who have fun playing math games. It is also a fact that many formalists fail to understand even the most basic concepts in economics, even in their own fields- I have verified this through numerous conversations with formalists. They are too busy working out formal proofs, like the ones that litter this book, to bother with the concepts that math is supposedly indispensable for understanding.<br /><br />Some would say that this book teaches the tools of technical analysis. What it really teaches how to perform intellectual gymnastics. The authors do work a few substantive concepts into their math. Unfortunately, the substance of this book is almost as poor as its presentation. The authors demonstrate little understanding of the transactions costs/property rights economics developed by Coase, Demsetz, and Alchian and no understanding of Hayek's knowledge problem. This books discussion of public goods and monopoly suffer from a lack of understanding of these concepts. There is little Public Choice in this book. They take a run through the Arrow theorem, but that's about all you will find on Public Choice here. Real institutions and processes get almost no play in this book. The best parts are the parts on game theory. Here the authors stray away from their useless thought experiments and hit on some real issues. There are vastly superior books on game theory, so this bright spot hardly makes up for this books general deficiencies.<br /><br />This book is a disaster because it conditions graduate students to think in terms of static equilibrium only. Of course, the authors might claim that chapter twenty covers dynamics, but this is untrue. Chapter twenty covers the oxymoronic subject of \\"dynamic equilibrium\\". Joseph Schumpeter explained why capitalism cannot be understood in terms of any equilibrium model or \\"golden rule\\" back in 1912. The economists who hail this book as the best book out there, or even slightly useful, have been taken in by some very elaborate and mathematically sophisticated nonsense. If you want to learn real economics read Schumpeter, Knight, Coase, Hayek, North... anybody but MWG.<br /><br />Lucky graduate students will get Nicholson as a graduate textbook. Given the current obsession with formalism, most will be misled by Mas Colel, Whinston and Green. One can only hope that the current trend toward formalism will burn itself out soon, through its own irrelevance. Then there might be a revival of real economics, practiced by true professionals.are too busy working out formal proofs, like the ones that litter this book, to bother with the concepts that math is supposedly indispensable for understanding.

Science fiction is a medium that is tailor-made for investigation of some of humanity's most perplexing questions, most especially questions of his (and the universe's) origin, God, what constitutes moral behavior, man's ultimate purpose. But very few science fiction novels really attempt to tackle these questions, getting caught up instead in the nifty gadgets that can be imagined, and forgetting their human element. Not so here.<br /><br />Russell has crafted a fine work of character, of people both exceptional and very real, in this tale of first contact between a Jesuit sponsored mission and the denizens of the planet  Rakhat. Emilio Sandoz is the only survivor of this mission, and most of the story is told from his viewpoint, both as a currently happening time-line and a later recollection under interrogation after he returns to Earth. It is easy to become engrossed in this man's life, as we see him as a great linguist, a priest with very understandable doubts but a solid need to help others, a man with normal desires for companionship, a person suffering under sever stress, a man mangled both physically and mentally. The other mission members are not slighted in the character development area, so that by the mid-point of the book, I felt that I was living with a very tight-knit family, whose individual foibles were all well-known and accepted, whose interpersonal banter was enjoyable and fitting.<br /><br />It is this very depth of characterization that adds poignancy to the mission's fate and starkly highlights the main religious question. How can one believe in a God that allows such terrible things as the mission failure to happen? How can one not believe in a higher power that has orchestrated such an incredibly complex universe of objects, intelligences, and events?  Falling within this halo are other questions, ones of personal responsibility against an omniscient deity, institutionalized religion versus an individual call to God, the morality of killing in a culture radically different from our own, when does pride in accomplishment become insufferable hubris? Russell does not provide answers, but her characters each have their own way of dealing with these questions, methods both practical and, for some, esoteric. In this area, this novel is very comparable to James Blish's A Case of Conscience, another fine novel working within this same area of ideas and religious import.<br /><br />There are some elements that are not so good. Possibly most obvious is the idea that a privately funded mission to contact the first verified alien intelligence would not only be the first but the only mission, at least until the rest of the world found out about this mission.

Russell does not provide answers, but her characters each have their own way of dealing with these questions, methods both practical and, for some, esoteric. In this area, this novel is very comparable to James Blish's A Case of Conscience, another fine novel working within this same area of ideas and religious import.    There are some elements that are not so good. Possibly most obvious is the idea that a privately funded mission to contact the first verified alien intelligence would not only be the first but the only mission, at least until the rest of the world found out about this mission.

Once this happens, the material is truly understood - not because it has been read, but because it has been lived. We are all addicted to our thoughts. We like playing the same fantasies over and over in our heads, wasting our mental resources. This truly is unfortunate, as it prevents us from experiencing the world around us. Practicing the techniques in this book will give you a solid anchor in the real world. Paradoxically, some of the information in this book may seem a little \\"out there\\" if it's not fully understood/experienced. I assure you, though, that there is very little in his book that can't be proven through self-observation. Anyone claiming that these teachings are BS simply hasn't observed themselves, or refuses to out of mind/ego attachment.<br />This book teaches you how to become conscious. This is a surprisingly simple concept that the average intelligent person will be able to fully grasp within the first fifty pages. Once your consiousness is in control, you will have tremendous mental focus and clarity. Remember, you are not learning how to enter some abstract/mystical state of consiousness; you are learning how to PAY ATTENTION to yourself and the world around you. Of course, this is quite mystical compared to what we think we know as \\"paying attention\\", which is really just pathetically blinking in and out of consiousness for a few seconds before retreating back to the worries, fantasies, and false comforts of the self-condemned ego-mind.	2003-02-19

This excellent book chronicles what is possibly God's divine providence in his life.  Here is the evidence that I speak of about Washington being a Christian;  There have been numerous prayers written by Washington, verified in his handwriting, that mention Christ and his faith in Christ again and again.  Many of these more poignant prayers reflect the way in which he felt guilty for his sins and he realized his need for the mercy of God....again, always making mention of Jesus in these prayers.   After a request for a chaplain to accompany his army onto the frontier when Washington was a colonel was not fulfilled, Washington himself conducted Sunday worship services and preached to his troops for 2 full years.   Washington forbade profanity by his troops explaining - and I'm paraphrasing -  'Our enemy is so great (at the time there were 500 British ships right offshore!) How can we expect the divine providence and assistance of Almighty God if we 'betray' him and do those things he despises with our speech.'<BR>     When Washington's father died - George was 11 - His mother required him to conduct daily worship services in their home for the whole family.  <BR>   Upon reading his diary, you will see multiple references to his attendance of Church on Sunday ( Sunday - attended Church or Sunday - inclement weather - unable to attend Church ) <BR>     The revisionists of history and indeed most history books for students today, dampen or even worse, reverse Washington's greatness.  As one prominent historian wrote of the historical revisionists: \\" These termites of the timber of our history - they seek to destroy his(Washington's ) greatness because, they are not great and cannot be.  They seek to destroy his goodness because they are not good.  To face the father of our country as he really is......they (the revisionists) couldnot face themselves and what they are\\"   -  <BR>   This book is rooted in historical fact.  Washington was a Christian if you look objectively at the historical evidence. <BR>     I don't know if having four bullet holes in your coat and two horses shot out from under you in battle and surviving is divine providence or not, but, if you're a Christian, you certainly know that it could be.	2003-02-16

I'm going to get right to the point: what a fantastic book!! The subject of the book, the ancient prophet Zarathustra and his world-changing message, is absolutely fascinating, not to mention how important it is to our proper understanding of history and who we are; and the author really does it justice, too! I can only think that if this book isn't widely read and talked about, it will be through no fault of the author's. <br />&quot;In Search of Zarathustra&quot; is very well-written and an excellent example of how to make history entertaining, without compromising the requirement to accurately inform. But the book is much more than simply history though. It's really a search for something important and very profound, and the author makes it a joy for the reader to join him on the journey. Part history. Part travelogue. Part investigation of the soul... All seamlessly woven together!<br />I can find very few things to fault with this book, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. Overall the editing is superb, and I spotted only very few (mostly minor) errors; e.g., in a couple of places incorrect dates related to Cyrus the Great are given, and Yazd is shown as 'Yadz' on the maps. While not a scholar per se, the author clearly is educated, well-travelled, and has done his homework very, very well. There's little in this book that can't be verified easily, and a comprehensive list of sources is given in the notes section at the end. Another thing I think adds real value to the book is the inclusion, in both front and back, of clearly marked maps; something I found to be most useful!! The book has 28 photos, which also helped to bring the subject matter to life.<br />In some ways this book reminds me of two other books I've read: &quot;In Search of the Birth of Jesus: The Real Journey of the Magi&quot; by Paul William Roberts, and &quot;The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy&quot; by Yuri Stoyanov (the author here actually cites an earlier edition of Stoyanov's book as a reference). The former is a light-hearted, more entertaining read, while the latter is a thorough, vast and erudite (though still very readable) survey. Both are excellent books, but what I especially like about &quot;In Search of Zarathustra&quot; is that it combines the best of both worlds: highly readable, entertaining, imaginative, and yet complete in its exploration of the subject.<br />This really is the best book that I've read in quite some time. I'm not sure what more I could say to recommend it. So instead I'll simply end with: Get this book. You won't regret it!!	2003-02-14

Narrated by Masaaki Hatsumi, 34th generation lineage holder of the Togakure school of ninpo (and holder of 8 other traditional Japanese martial lineages, at least 6 of which have been verified), This book is the closest thing Hatsumi sensei has written to an autobiography.   Hatsumi introduces us to his teacher, Takamatsu Sensei.  Chapter 2 includes an interview with Takamatsu sensei conducted by Hatsumi, and throughout he discusses his experiences training with his teacher, his love for his teacher, and how he came to understand the ideas Takamatsu imparted to him.  <br />Numerous learning incidents are recounted by Hatsumi, both while training, and also while simply spending time with his teacher.  Each chapter includes a traditional story which imparts something of the spirit of ninpo to the reader.  Hatsumi Sensei's writings are rife with anecdotes, recollections, historical observations, and cautiously thought out conclusions. Most touching I found to be his visit to Takamatsu Sensei's tomb accompanied by the Sensei's daughter, and the thought she shared with him (page 68).  <br />For those looking for an introduction to ninjutsu, I'd recommend Masaaki Hatsumi's other book, &quot;Ninjutsu: History and Traditions&quot;.  For the reader prepared to go beyond learning about ninja weapons and general history, this volume &quot;Essence of Ninjutsu: The Nine Traditions&quot; offers a look at the heart of a kindly man and a profound art.	2003-02-13

Although I must admit I don't buy into sensational claims of chi power, the supernatural, and such, I found author Glenn Morris's account of his journey along the martial arts path entertaining and enjoyable.  This was one of those books I lost sleep over--reading when I should be getting a good night's rest.  One unique feature of this volume is Chapter 6, \\"The Godan or Master's Test for a Ninja\\", where Morris describes not only how the Go-dan (5th degree black belt) test in Bujinkan Ninjutsu/Taijutsu is conducted, but his own experience taking this test (he failed the first two times).  He writes, \\"The fifth degree means you are a master of the basic physical, mental, and spiritual fundamentals with your own contributions to make to the system.\\" (page 87)<br />Morris describes his philosophy of ninpo (ninja way, path of ninjutsu) as he relates amazing experiences with men such as Masaaki Hatsumi who is one of the world's few ~practicing~ ninpo historians (at least 6 of Hatsumi's 9 ranks in traditional Japanese martial arts have been verified), and Stephen Hayes who is Hatsumi's seniormost American Student (see chapter 8).  There are a plethora of other individuals whose names will no doubt be recognized by Bujinkan folks, esoterica buffs, and amateur martial arts historians alike.  <br />Morris is an interesting man, and has no qualms about candidly sharing his spiritual beliefs and personal experiences with his readers.  He describes seeing different colored auras around people during their practice, sending and receiving chi,and his own experience with the spirituality of sex.  I'm not too sure the colored, shimmering auras Glenn Morris sees are anywhere but in his own mind, and I don't buy his inflated views of his own psychic prowess which he sometimes seems to cloak in selflessness (notably absent when he describes his first two failures during his Go-dan test). My skepticism however, hasn't stopped me from appreciating his unique point of view.  If you enjoyreading the autobiographies of martial artists or interesting people in general, Glenn Morris has written this volume for you!	2003-02-13

A novel idea even now, Jaynes proposed that until about 3 000 years ago, the human mind was sharply divided - a &quot;bicameral mind.&quot; One part dealt with the normal daily occupations of survival and reproduction. The other part was a conduit for communications with the gods. Jaynes portrays the brain's structure and how it might generate &quot;hallucinatory&quot; voices and images that were construed as supernatural. Not until the civilization of Greece was well advanced did the consciousness we're familiar with arise and partially replace these hallucinatory visions. The pivot point, in Jaynes' view, is the distinction between the Iliad and Odyssey.<br />According to Jaynes, these two epic poems are qualitatively distinct, with the Iliad expressing the voice of the gods, but the Odyssey shifting to the voice of men. He makes bold assertions, &quot;there is no general consciousness in the Iliad&quot; - presuming the reader has accepted his definition of &quot;consciousness.&quot; He dissects the poem in demonstrating it presents only the voices of the gods. By the conclusion of his analysis you may be convinced that if there really is such a thing as &quot;genetic determinism&quot; it certainly resided in the brain of humans who went through life without a single &quot;conscious&quot; expression. The brain created and imparted signals that could only be discerned as &quot;divine.&quot; &quot;Will&quot; was absent. &quot;Creativity&quot; is missing from this analysis, although his sections on poetry and music make compelling reading. All was not lost for human beings, however. Conscious today, Jaynes finds in Homer's next poem the sign the evidence of its emergence. In the Odyssey, the humans take over the job of expressing their own destinies, leading to the expansion of consciousness through the remainder of history.<br />To accept this thesis, one must accept the idea that such human feats as irrigation systems in the Tigris-Euphrates civilizations, the Egyptian pyramids and even navigating the Mediterranean Sea were driven by hallucinations - &quot;gods&quot; imparted the means of these accomplishments. Jaynes urges this notion forcefully, citing examples in other societies such as the Aztecs or Incas of the Western Hemisphere [He ignores Asian societies utterly]. Even poetry and song, according to Jaynes, were actually the &quot;voices&quot; of hallucinations produced by the bicameral mind. The evolution to the &quot;subjective&quot; mind was rapid and clearly consequential, but Jaynes is unable to provide the mechanism of the transition.<br />Jaynes' proposal still generates discussion and assessment. Since tracing the evolution of the bicameral mind is inherently impossible, his proposal can never be verified. This book did, however, generate many studies. For that reason alone, this book remains a valuable contribution to cognitive studies. Whatever its shortcomings - the &quot;reading in&quot; of historical evidence, the over-precise time frame, the narrow European view, the bizarre speculations, don't invalidate the proposal of how the human mind evolved. No-one studying the mind and its development can afford to overlook Jaynes' contribution.<br />- Review by stephen a. haines, Ottawa, Canaday.<br />To accept this thesis, one must accept the idea that such human feats as irrigation systems in the Tigris-Euphrates civilizations, the Egyptian pyramids and even navigating the Mediterranean Sea were driven by hallucinations - &quot;gods&quot; imparted the means of these accomplishments.

What may sound like editorializing seems to be verified by supporting documentation of priests who victimize boys of all from adolesence to young adulthood, and the book reads more like an elongated newspaper article, not that that's bad. But, at its heart, \\"Betrayal ...\\" maps out what a convincing argument that an inordinate number of child molesters seem to be in the clergy. If you can get past the sheer devastation of divine trust shattered and totally destroyed and the childhoods literally decimated, \\"Betrayal ...\\" also posits the question of why the child abuse crisis exists. One plausible theory, though certainly not justification for sex with children, is that the celibate nature of the priesthood perverts sexual desire to the expression of child molesting. That one sounds, and one would hope, more plausible than the terrifying other possibility that the priesthood attracts what \\"Betrayal ...\\" classifies as homosexuals. With that theory, however, the unfair and inaccurate implication that homosexuals are also child molesters isn't satisfactorily explored and dismissed. On this count, \\"Betrayal ...\\" might be serving the hopefully unintended fears that fuel homophobia. More fully, though, the book states clearly what is indeed a crisis by any standard. The non-Catholic whose church is not under fire may not be as moved by the sense of betrayal that the Catholic faithful may inevitably suffer. However, \\"Betrayal ...\\" and the priests who offer their commentary are barely spared from coming off as a crisis of faith and, instead, must be read as a crisis of man and not the God of worship. In the end, the Catholics among us cannot help but feel betrayed by the men in whom we have entrusted our children. And by remembering the crisis is man-made, we don't have to lose our faith in the God of our worship. In the end, those of us who are Catholic may conclude that our church's heirarchy has to be dismantled, accountability institutionally implemented and the demons of our children prosecuted along with being treated.	2003-02-12

That includes his own research on New York that won the Bancroft Prize in 1982.<br />If you're uncomfortable with the lack of footnotes, Countryman isn't the only one to do this. John Fairbank did the same with some of his books on China (but of course you'll reply that Fairbank was a giant in his field). In any case, most of Countryman's facts can be verified by referring to earlier works in this field. His assertion about pre-marital pregnancies was borrowed from Robert Gross' &quot;The Minutemen and their world&quot;, where the proper statistics are included in detail. <br />If you find jumps in chronology and unconventional details distracting, that would rule out much of the fine historical writing of the last 40 years, wouldn't it? Countryman was aiming for a thematic, rather than purely narrative, history of the Revolution, and military history was secondary to his argument - hence the sparse attention paid to it. Personally, I'm glad I got this book as it's a lively and stimulating read for anyone new to the subject - unless you love reading footnotes, that is.	2003-02-09

Allegedly he visited realms of existence to which the rest of us will relocate after we die. Trouble is, his accounts differ markedly from those of people with near-dear experiences and from mediumistic information. So whom to believe? Well, the NDEs and the channeled info can at least be verified in certain ways - for instance, if an NDE involves an observation of medical procedures that are later confirmed, or if the medium brings through information about this world that there is no normal way of knowing, then we may perhaps be justified in accepting the rest of the account as trustworthy. Leland's dreams offer no such objectively testable content, so we have to take them on faith. <br />The author does try to substantiate his views by comparing them with ancient writings on the afterlife and with some NDE accounts, but it's not clear whether his knowledge of these matters may have influenced his dreams in the first place. I also had a great deal of trouble believing that Leland could remember his dreams/travels in such exhaustive detail; he recounts long conversations, which go on for pages, with otherworldly beings called Facilitators. This material reads like fiction or, at the very least, like a highly embellished account of a dream. <br />On the plus side, the book is well written and presents interesting summaries of esoteric material from many cultures. I just don't buy into Leland's astral traveling.	2003-02-05

Well, indeed, it seems many people have forgotten about Alar, or rather what Alar really was. The authors actually bother to do the research about this incident and many others, showing (in this case) that although the original controversy over Alar was caused somewhat by PR, the fierce rebuttal that turned Alar into a synonym for bad marketing was /completely/ manufactured. And don't think that what you're reading in this book is a disortion; I've seen some of their examples repeated in books on science and others in books on business, and the fact that P.R. figures heavily in our lives can be verified by simply turning on your television or reading the newspaper.<br />This book is a must-read for anyone who wonders if the Independent Institute is really independent or how many members of the Concerned Mothers are really mothers.	2003-02-01

Lawrence Quirk and William Schoell's &quot;essential&quot; biography of Joan Crawford is short on biographical detail, and much more a study of Crawford's films and performances then her life.And even at that, it's full of inaccuracies.  With two authors, you would have thought at least one of them would have done their homework and verified their facts.  But there are some glaring mistakes.In their description of THE WOMEN (1939), they state that Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) goes to Nevada for a divorce where she encounters new friend Peggy Dow (Joan Fontaine).  But Peggy is part of Mary's circle of friends right from the start of the film, and travels WITH Mary to Nevada.  She doesn't encounter her there.The book states Victor Buono's daffy Cockney mother in WHAT EVER HAPPEND TO BABY JANE (1962) was played by Anna Lee.  The lovely and beautiful British actress Anna Lee plays the Hudson sisters neighbor, Mrs. Bates.  Buono's mother is played by character actress Marjorie Bennett.The book claims Crawford had a low opinion of Janis Paige during the making of THE CARETAKERS (1963), probably because Paige was &quot;the kind of pretty, rising starlet&quot; that she found threatening and not generally professional.  But Paige had been starring in movies since 1946 as a Warner Brothers contract actress.  She may not have reached Crawford's heights of stardom, but she was an established and professional actress, and far from a rising starlet by 1963.With such obvious errors, it's hard to take this book seriously.	2003-02-01

Consequently, you would expect his research to be first-rate, and you would be correct.  In compiling research for this book, he traveled extensively across the U.S. and Europe to conduct personal interviews.<br />He correctly documents how in the 1950s there was a tremendous amount of research into antigravity conducted by U.S. defense contractors and funded by the government.  There were public statements by these contractors that they were only a few years away from deploying antigravity craft.  Then, suddenly all such talk and publicly available information on these activities stopped.  Since that time, the term &quot;antigravity&quot; has become a dirty word and neither the government nor defense contractors will touch it.  Gee, I wonder why?<br />There is a long history of individuals such as Searl, Carr, Schauberger, Hutchinson and Hamel that have claimed to have developed working antigravity devices out of their own garages.  Recently, two Russian government scientists replicated Searl's SEG and verified the unusual and inexplicable results, including antigravity.  If an individual working on their own can develop such technology, what do you think the government has developed with their unlimited black budgets?  Does the U.S. government have working antigravity crafts?  You better believe it.<br />One ancillary effect connected to most antigravity devices is the unexplained ability of these devices to draw energy from some inexhaustable source, possibly zero point.  This amounts to free, completely clean energy available to everyone.  Not exactly something the &quot;powers-that-be&quot; get excited about, not to mention the prospect of someone like Hussein ending up with propulsion technology that can generate virtually unlimited speeds with the odd right-angle turn thrown in.<br />As a consequence to all ofthis, antigravity/free-energy has become the most classified subject on the planet.  I marvel at how the &quot;powers that be&quot; have managed to completely discredit the antigravity field outside of black projects, to the point that there is an automatic &quot;giggle-factor&quot; associated with the word.  In order to accomplish this, a completely erroneous theory of gravity has been perpetuated.  In actuality, gravity is a pseudo-force of electromagnetism, not a separate force in and of itself.<br />However, things are about to change.  We have reached the point where burning fossil fuels can no longer be tolerated.  Therefore, a plan is in place to eliminate the current suppression of these technologies, and this will occur within about 10 years.  This plan does not come from within the government itself.  And, for those that do not believe in the reality of antigravity, I suggest you personally replicate the Hayasaka experiments, which are not difficult to do.  Or, if you are more ambitious, get two copper plates 12 inches in diameter and one inch thick.  Put one inch of acrylic between these plates (no air bubbles, please).  Place one million volts DC across the plates and the device will levitate in the direction of the positive pole.<br />A final note; the author completely missed the Searl work, which is a major gaffe, since they are both from England.	2003-01-30

That is just insanity.  Giving himself 4 stars to match the average would be far more honest.<br />Now, that being said,  I have to give credit to the dissapointing &quot;few&quot; scientists that try to examine the evidence for paranormal using the scientific method.   The science communitiy is general prefers to dismiss out of hand any paranormal claims.  Either they say that paranormal cannot be studied using scientific methods or that all evidence suggests the paranormal cannot be verified scientifically.  When People come forward to attempt to examine this topic scientifically,t hey are usually laughed at, or worse, intentionally ridiculed.  IT is naive to think that people may not want to believe that paranormal activity exists and will attack anyone who even attempts to examine the issue.   It is certainly comendable when someone risks their reputations to publish thier findings.   That doesnt make them right however.  It certainly increases their credibility in my opinion.  Sure there are some who merely want to capitalize on an ignorant and all to willing to believe general public but do not paint everyone with the same brush.   Simply read this well written book and decide for yourself if the author is trying to con an ignorant public or is really trying to be objective about the whole thing. This book is certainly more objective that every single pro-paranormal book I have ever read.   As to his use of anectodal evidence, it is simply required.   THe science communinty has done so little experimentation that anecdotal evidence is all we got (in many cases).  That doesnt mean the author is saying that he has proven that the paranormal exists simply because he writes about some anectodal events. Ultimately, it is up to the reader to decide if the author is being fair or not.   Reading the book doesnt mean you have to agree with it.	2003-01-24

That's because, assuming the author did his homework honestly and accurately (as I do), this is a record of spontaneous (not hypnosis-induced) memories, recorded by a credentialed psychiatrist, for which there are corresponding detailed historical records (records she was very unlikely to have known of, especially when she wrote down her memories as a school-girl). Not one historically-recorded person only, but several people mentioned in the patient's recollections are verified as having actually existed, along with places. This has been done before, but rarely so completely.<br />The book also gives a very good sense of what the Cathars were like, and it brings up an interesting question--which group was the more &quot;heretical&quot;--the Cathars, or the politically dominant Catholic Church which persecuted them?<br />And its companion question: does might always make right?	2003-01-24

He rejected the traditional idea that scientific knowledge was based on a method called induction whereby theories are verified by observations. Popper argued that the logical process of induction simply does not exist.  Theories are forever tentative and the most useful function  (and the only logically decisive effect) of observations is to act as tests or attempted falsifications of theories. <br />It is application of  this theory to stock markets that is of extreme relevance for a trader. \\"Stock markets are places where different propositions are tested\\" are the nine most important words ever written about stock markets. Once we can see the mistake that the market is making in coming to general conclusions from specific events then making money is easy as a trader.<br />I think this philosophy of Knowledge reconciles his poor capability to predict events which is always based on some generalizations with his stock market success as well as his ability to see the flaws in general in a generalization that the market has accepted.	2003-01-24

Admittedly, Michelle's recount of her deathbed interview with John is not to be missed.  But nearly everything else is either covered elsewhere (John's and Michelle's books, Denny's stage presentation, and Jon Johnson's biography of Cass) or questionable in integrity and intent.  Particularly galling is the amount of mud slung at Cass Elliot, who of course can no longer tell her own side of the story, with no evidence of any attempt to contact anyone who might.

Unaffiliated scholars agree, for Christianity accepted reincarnation until 553 AD, when it was dropped from the doctrine at the Fifth Ecumenical Council at Constantinople for reasons that may have been far more political than theological. Consequently since the Synoptic Gospels date from 66-74 & 132-135 AD, certain Biblical passages suggestive of reincarnation may indeed be subtle remnants of Christianity's original reincarnation doctrine. That may also explain why Jesus spoke well of the Samaritans despite the fact that they believed in reincarnation as revealed in their Taheb doctrine. The Gnostics who refused to forsake reincarnation after 553 AD were suddenly overnight \\"heretics,\\" but was it actually the Church that was guilty of heresy insofar as Jesus' original teachings were concerned?<br /><br />Insofar as Judaism and reincarnation are concerned the Zohar, the Manasseh Ben Israel & other Jewish books all affirm reincarnation. The Hassidic Jews still believe in reincarnation, as does mystical Judaism (Kabala). Moreover, according to Flavius Josephus, Eleazar, commander of the garrison at Masada before it fell to the Romans, gave speeches that radically departed from modern Judaism. They were astonishingly Essene, & even *Gnostic*, in nature with concepts like pre-existing immortal souls & reincarnation.<br /><br />Ever heard of the Essenes? Back in 1929 Lewis did. He wrote at length of the Essene sect and in great detail. And consider this: The Dead Sea Scrolls that mentioned the Essenes for the first time in modern history were not discovered until 1945! Therefore Lewis wrote of the Essenes sixteen years before the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered! Such is easily verified and cannot simply be summarily dismissed by even the most obstinately entrenched of scoffers or dogmatists.<br /><br />So does it mean anything that in the original verse Jesus was referred to as \\"Jesus the Nazarene\\" rather than \\"Jesus of Nazareth?\\" Is there physical evidence that Nazareth existed during the time of Jesus? Lewis says `no,' and provides intriguing references to support his contention. Interestingly unaffiliated scholars point out that Roman maps & papers; the Talmud; St. Paul, & even Flavius Josephus never mention Nazareth.<br /><br />Is Jesus the first and only \\"son of God,\\" or is there precedent for differing but equal Christs or Christos \\"myths\\" throughout the world? Lewis points out that the Christian fathers were aware of previous Christos myths that occurred on December 25th that there were heralded with the well-known signs and portents: A star in the east, virgin birth, wise men in attendance and etc...<br /><br />So what does it all mean?<br /><br />While dogmatists and atheists have their own theories, according to mystics like Lewis, previous Christs of all races, faiths & philosophies --like Jesus-- all came from the same Creator and were all equal but different based on the needs and idiosyncrasies of the times and cultures. The implication is that orthodox Christianity could be vastly different--even incompatible--with what Jesus actually taught or indeed ANY species of intolerant orthodox religious belief.<br /><br />Could Jesus have been a Gentile instead of a Jew? Was He celibate? Lewis seems to think both. Unaffiliated scholars point out that if a Rabbi, Jesus would have been expected to obey the Mishnaic Law that required all Jews to marry before teaching, thus he have been expected to have children. Judaic orthodox culture rigorously condemned celibacy, yet there's absolutely no mention of Jesus' presumed celibacy in the Bible.<br /><br />Otherwise could humanistic references to Jesus have been expunged from the Bible because they contradicted the Nicene Ecumenical Council that voted Jesus equal to God? The vote was not unanimous.<br /><br />Perhaps most astonishingly, Lewis asserts that Jesus survived the crucifixion and points out some intriguing points to support his theory. Unaffiliated scholars point out that even Bishop Irenaeus of Lyons held that Jesus survived the crucifixion and lived to be an old man. According to some, the \\"Apocalypse of Peter\\" (Greek) asserts that Jesus survived the crucifixion. However others assert that the Dead Sea Scrolls, Hebrews 5:7-8 and Gospel of Barnabas reveal the crucifixion to be a hoax. Is that necessarily a contradiction?<br /><br />Furthermore any Judaic historian should be able to tell you that Judaic law forbade the Sanhedrin to convene at night & only allowed execution by stoning. The \\"custom\\" of releasing prisoners during Passover *NEVER* existed. The vinegar given Jesus wasn't a torment but a common stimulant. And finally any Greco-Roman historian will tell you that the crucifixion routinely took days, or even weeks, to kill--not mere hours. And the crucifixion \\"cross\\" was actually a T, and the crucified were nailed through the wrists-not the palms.<br /><br />In the original Greek, Joseph of Arimathea asks for the body of Jesus with the word \\"SOMA\\"--a word that applied ONLY to *LIVING* bodies. According to Roman law back then, the crucified were denied burial & left to decompose on the cross as a warning to others. And Roman Centurions, as a mercy, only broke the legs of the crucified *BEFORE* death to induce suffocation. It would be senseless to break the legs of a corpse. And quite pithily, Lewis points out that dead bodies-even crucified ones-thanks to gravity cannot bleed.<br /><br />\\"Why do you seek the living among the dead?\\"<br /><br />Could that quote have a startling alternative interpretation? Lewis certainly thinks so.<br /><br />And finally, yes, there is a single illustration of an ancient swastika, several references to an ancient Asian \\"Great White Brotherhood,\\" and the theory Jesus may have been an \\"Aryan.\\" While perhaps perfectly innocent back in 1929, after a recent rereading even I winced at some of Lewis's somewhat archaic phraseology. While the entire logic of the book clearly refutes the  one-star reviewers' criticisms, if however only the very beginning of the book is read--or the entire book merely skimmed-- there is the potential for misunderstanding, or willful misrepresentation, if certain things are taken out of context. Therefore I urge AMORC to consider a new revised edition to perhaps better reflect the sensibilities of the post World War Two age.<br /><br />Keep these four points in mind as you read the one-star reviews and decide for yourself if they're logical and fair...or something else altogether:<br /><br />First of all Lewis cites several Christ (Christos myths) from several times and cultures that predated Jesus the Christ as being equal in nature to Jesus, although Lewis considers Jesus to have been the last and greatest in degree to date--a view any reasonable person can see is totally incompatible with racism or Nazism.<br /><br />Second, the \\"Swastika\\" is cites as being of ancient Asian origin, as well as Buddhist, East Indian, and even American Indian that precedes nazi Germany by centuries if not millenia. Any World War II historian can tell you that Hitler appropriated the swastika for Nazism-not the other way around-- as Hitler had a mania for mystical symbols.<br /><br />Thirdly, the \\"Great White Brotherhood\\" and \\"Aryan\\" terms Lewis refers to are attributed to an *Asian* mystical organization named the former. Therefore, (I cannot believe that I actually have to actually point this out...) the \\"White\\" in \\"Great White Brotherhood\\" obvioulsy(!) wouldn't refer to skin pigmentation. Asian skin pigments tend to be on a continuum from yellow to tan or dark brown--hardly Nordic (or Nazi) lily white as some of the more, ah... obtuse would seem to think if such can actually be called thinking.<br /><br />And fourth and finally no, this book has no bibliography as such. Considering the fact that Lewis wrote of the Essenes sixteen years before any university scholars even knew that that the Essenes had existed, such a scholary bibliography would have been impossible to create. Again, many subsequent scholarly works now support many of Lewis's contentions, some of which are in my readers's guide.<br /><br />So read the book, *THINK*, and then decide for yourself.hite Brotherhood,\\" and the theory Jesus may have been an \\"Aryan.\\" While perhaps perfectly innocent back in 1929, after a recent rereading even I winced at some of Lewis's somewhat archaic phraseology.

Keep these four points in mind as you read the one-star reviews and decide for yourself if they're logical and fair...or something else altogether:     First of all Lewis cites several Christ (Christos myths) from several times and cultures that predated Jesus the Christ as being equal in nature to Jesus, although Lewis considers Jesus to have been the last and greatest in degree to date--a view any reasonable person can see is totally incompatible with racism or Nazism.    Second, the \\"Swastika\\" is cites as being of ancient Asian origin, as well as Buddhist, East Indian, and even American Indian that precedes nazi Germany by centuries if not millenia. Any World War II historian can tell you that Hitler appropriated the swastika for Nazism-not the other way around-- as Hitler had a mania for mystical symbols.    Thirdly, the \\"Great White Brotherhood\\" and \\"Aryan\\" terms Lewis refers to are attributed to an *Asian* mystical organization named the former. Therefore, (I cannot believe that I actually have to actually point this out...) the \\"White\\" in \\"Great White Brotherhood\\" obvioulsy(!) wouldn't refer to skin pigmentation. Asian skin pigments tend to be on a continuum from yellow to tan or dark brown--hardly Nordic (or Nazi) lily white as some of the more, ah... obtuse would seem to think if such can actually be called thinking.     And fourth and finally no, this book has no bibliography as such. Considering the fact that Lewis wrote of the Essenes sixteen years before any university scholars even knew that that the Essenes had existed, such a scholary bibliography would have been impossible to create. Again, many subsequent scholarly works now support many of Lewis's contentions, some of which are in my readers's guide.     So read the book, *THINK*, and then decide for yourself.	2003-01-19

Though he prefers distance from Laura, Milt reluctantly follows up on her complaint and quickly learns that Trent's girlfriend Amanda Nederwald has failed to come home either.<br />Milt visits the Seven Trumpets estate, but before he sees anyone, he finds the corpse of a young female that is later verified is Amanda.  Trent remains missing.  Milt visits the church where he notices that most of the flock consists of pregnant women.  His interview with the founder Brother Grigsby goes well, but also leaves Milt feeling a bit creepy. He returns with his wife, psychiatrist Dr. Jean McDonnell, so she can provide him with a quick assessment of Grigsby.  As Milt and his department investigate the homicide and missing boyfriend, his niece becomes a recruitment target of the Seven Trumpets.<br />LYING WONDERS is an exciting police procedural that readers will enjoy due to the clever interweaving of the overflow of Milt's past personal life into the murder investigation.  The story line never slows down even when the hero's sister and niece go at it.  Milt is a strong character that makes the rest of the cast seems real because he comes across as a person with complex relationships.  Though his sarcastic behavior in his second encounter with Grigsby seems out of character for the calm sheriff, Susan Rogers Cooper provides a delightful who-done-it.<br />Harriet Klausner	2003-01-18

In his book &quot;The Naked Capitalist,&quot; Professor Cleon Skousen, former editor of the policemen's magazine, &quot;Law and Order,&quot; wrote, &quot;Professional investigators will tell you concerning criminal conspiracies that sometimes you have to wait them out.  Eventually someone will go the authorities with information that can be independently verified.

My question, in case it may be valid, is how does it happen that this book, &quot;Who Rules America Now?&quot;, manages to completely disregard or ignore the revelations made in these others - revelations not just about how rich people happen to be powerful, but of exactly how that power has come to be exercised?

Maya's own manuals are comparably lousy and the meager information available to newbies has to be verified and expanded during years of tedious trial and error programming. Most people simply follow in the footsteps of senior programmer colleagues who had to figure everything out for themselves and thus help propagate a culture of continuously reinforced bad code writing habits that do not make effective use of the full range of available tools. Especially the chapters on MEL and Expression writing are simple, clearly structured and easy to understand. The same can be said for the chapters on the Maya API, however, while the MEL and Expression sections do indeed warrant the use of the word Complete in the book's title the API section does not. I would have hoped for more information about some of the more exotic node types such as Shaders or Tool Contexts etc... This is where the Maya manuals fall short and where the book could have jumped in. However, with the book clarifying most fundamental aspects and structures of the API that missing information can be worked out by a skilled programmer. I'm glad I purchased this book and it will serve me well as a reference manual for both MEL and the API. Note to beginners: this book is not a fullblown tutorial but seems to be halfway between a tutorial and a reference manual. However, I've barely received my copy and I'm already considering it indispensible. My thanks to Mr. Gould!	2003-01-14

My only complaint thus far is that Rose is working in the Bird Cage in July 1881 and the Bird Cage didn't actually open under December 1881. 2 months AFTER the Gunfight at the OK Corral. It kind of threw me for awhile, since you are suppose to believe this stuff really happened. [...] I had to think \\"FICTION\\" and just enjoy it for what it is. <BR>I go to Tombstone frequently, and next week (when I go again!) I'm going to make a special trip to the Bird Cage....just to soak it all up again.<br />Edited later to add.....I finished the book whilst in Tombstone. Pat explains at the end that she knew the opening date was December 1881, but she knew that wasn't right. Later, after some investigation, they found that Wyatt Earp had issued a permit for the house of ill repute at the Bird Cage location in June 1881. The \\"Grand Opening\\" was held off till December while they awaited the arrival of the rosewood bar. So....she was right. The Bird Cage actually opened in June 1881. I verified this with the people working there.<br />Great read....I just wish her CD of Rose's song was still available....I could only find it on cassette and the lady at the Bird Cage gift store said that they get requests for the CD all of the time via their website...but Pat hasn't ordered any more from the distributor, so they don't have any for sale.<br />Anyway, great book!

David Brock spends most of his book describing his tremendous hand in bringing sleaze media into Republican politics.  He acknowledges many behind-the-scenes conservatives as well as other vested interests in the Republican party, which is helpful in perpetuating the reality of conservatism being the party attempting to legislate social norms and behaviors, but wanting government to remain distant from economics.  In this respect, it's moderately helpful.<br />I still feel awful about this book.  I can't fathom how a writer spends 300+ pages discussing how his bestsellers were assortments of eggagerations, misnomers, unverified facts, and selective truth telling, and then subsequently expects readers to accept and believe his contemporary perspective.  Given that he never explained at what point he learned bipartisan journalism, I really can't believe everything he claims; in particular, his treatment of his attitudes towards conservatism during his lengthy run in Washington as a sort of posturing for approval, silencing of his 'true identity', and other methods approximating brainwshing are simply unbelievable.<br />Overall, it's nice to see a title that attempts to apologise for one's actions as a conservative, one that additionally portrays the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" for what it really is (an attempt to create an image of a \\"vast left-wing conspiracy,\\" such that the populace remains distracted enough, leaving their guard down to swallow conservative theory without question).<br />The message I received from the book could be considered \\"Hey, don't believe this, that stuff is a lie.  Believe *this* instead!\\"  David Brock did enough damage during his career already, and I consider myself to be one bleeding heart liberal type who thinks that he owes this nation more than an apology (especially given the self-serving nature of his self-cleansing text here).	2003-01-09

I am downgrading my opinion of this book. <br />I still stand by Dr. Breiner's assertion that \\"silver/mercury\\" amalgam is bad for you. Not only is the mercury frequently toxic to many people, but amalgams are not bonded to the tooth like composites or ceramics. This requires the dentist to drill out more tooth structure to make the amalgam hold, thus leaving the tooth even weaker. Additionally, since the amalgam is not bonded, amalgam offers less physical support to the tooth (than bonded materials) and the tiny gap between the amalgam and the tooth can sometimes (but not always) lead to secondary tooth decay. (All of which lead to more tooth problems down the road). <br />The issue on both root canals and fluoride is still up in the air (IMO), but something that we should all pay attention to. From what I've read, topical fluoride is okay, but fluoridated water may not be so great for you. If you require a root canal, ask around about BioCalex as an alternate form of root canal therapy.<br />As for Electro-dermal screening a.k.a Electo-accupuncture According to Voll (EAV): Voll was a German scientist who did his research in the 50's (if I recall correctly). From my understanding, his research has never been verified or validated. I have many German friends who are medical doctors and they have never heard of this device or methodology of testing. As far as I can tell, EAV is a total scam that is frequently used by naturopaths and homeopaths to drain money out of people's wallets. Outside of that, EAV is completely useless.<br />In a nutshell, the chapters about amalgam, fluoride, and root canal issue are a good introduction. IMHO, the rest is either completely false, dubious, or a waste of time/money.<br />Personally, I would skip this book. There are better and more up-to-date sources on the amalgam, fluoride, and root canal issues. Though if you don'tknow anything about these 3 topics, this book might be a decent primer for you.	2003-01-07

The justification for keeping Dan's true identity secret struck me as false. Nerburn spends an extended amount of time staying with and traveling with the man; everyone around is sure to know who this White man is and what he is doing with Dan, yet supposedly he must now be kept anonymous to \\"protect\\" him. From whom? If it happened as told, everyone knew long ago.<br />\\"Grover\\" seems to be a fictional character used to set up Nerburn's narrative. His advice on how to tell the story is straight out of Creative Writing 101, Week 1, yet Nerburn acts as though he is utterly shocked by it. I'm guessing that \\"Grover's\\" words are Nerburns own advice to anyone telling a story.<br />That said, the book is essentially a New Age version of the Noble Savage. It's a dehumanizing one, because it denies the humanity of the indigenous peoples of this continent and reduces them to a stereotype. Real people are neither all good nor all bad; neither all pure nor all evil. The indigenous people of this continent were real people, not cartoons.<br />The Indians most definitely had a great environmental awareness, but did they really \\"walk lightly upon the earth\\"? Did they never waste, did they always show respect for all forms of life? Simply, no. <br />For example, \\"Using all parts of the buffalo\\" (bison) was the exception, not the norm. When bison populations were at their peak, there was a huge amount of waste. Large groups (more than 1000 at a time) were killed, by such means as driving them over a cliff, driving them into a river or onto soft ice on a body of water, or by engulfing them in a massive wall of fire. Frequently, only the choice parts, such as the tongue and the hump, were taken.(One tribe took only the fetuses). This was especially true if the hunt was for a ceremony or celebration, in which those favored parts, as delicacies, were to play a prominent role. Often, the bulls which were killed were ignored and left to rot, because their meat and hides were tougher than the cows'.<br />Often bison were hacked up while still alive. Bison which survived a fire were left wandering burned and blind, in agony. The cruelty was enormous.<br />If you read this book, read also \\"The Ecological Indian, Myth and History\\" by Shepard Krech to get a dispassionate and objective look at the myths which make up books like Nerburn's.	2003-01-07

While I'm not convinced that his six types are all really primarily ADD, or that they are the only types of ADD, still, this book provides fascinating insight into the physical basis for psychiatric difficulties. Dr. Amen's case studies are fascinating and quite compelling, and he shows both great tenderness for his clients and great insight into the needs and difficulties of people with ADD. <br />This book is extremely valuable for debunking the myth that ADD is not a real disability. Dr. Amen's use of brain imaging technology demonstrates the ways that some people's brains work differently and ineffectively. It's not just laziness--when people with ADD try to concentrate, the part of our brain that controls concentration just shuts down. It's genuinely a physical disability. Although I can \\"feel\\" this, to see it verified in black-and-white was extremely validating. <br />While Amen's treatments might be experimental, his diagnostic methods do not seem so. It is not \\"experimental\\" to use brain imaging technology to identify where the brain is working properly and not working enough. This has been done for many years. And it's not true that Amen's work is completely \\"out there\\"--his work was reviewed by research physicians in two departments (nuclear medicine and neurology, I think) at UCLA and found to be \\"good medicine\\" and worthwhile. Comparisons made in other reviews to procedures completely unsupported by any scientific evidence are really in themselves unsupportable. <br />I am not a doctor and can't recommend whether the treatments outlined in this book should be implemented. I can say that people with ADD, and those around them who doubt the reality of their difficulties, will learn a lot from looking at the brain images in this book and understanding the connections between the brain's impaired functioningand the associated symptoms. <br />Reading this book almost makes me feel that \\"normal\\" psychiatry is working in the dark without tools... Dr Amen might or might not have made as much progress in the field as this book appears to demonstrate, but nonetheless I think he must be on the right track. I wonder whether it will one day seem to us that trying to guess what's wrong with someone's brain without looking at it, is as strange as trying to diagnose strep throat over the phone.	2002-12-27

Or maybe it is both. Gerald Posner has a hard time making that decision, despite a well researched and historically well documented survey of Berry Gordy (and family's) legendary contribution to the music business.<BR>Posner has crafted a study of Motown that presents its founders, and stars as less-than-perfect (though most often well-likable) pioneers in business and entertainment, working together, though often butting heads with each other, in defining a company built on a legendary sound. Everyone is familiar with most of the players - The Gordy Family (this book delves into the family more so than most other Motown studies, and makes clear that Berry was the head, though not the sole talent of the family), Marvin Gaye (who is painted as a head case through much of the book), Diana Ross (Posner adds some new &quot;legends&quot; to this diva's conduct file, none of them pretty or flattering), Stevie Wonder (both respected and severely exploited, given his youth), Smokey robinson (probably the smartest businessman in the Motown stable), and others. Posner shoots down the legendary &quot;mob-connection&quot; tale, but fills his book with court records, verified statements from insiders, and previously published facts to present a company where competition between artists fueled the hit pipeline, but with severe cost to artists (Florence Ballard's story is still painful to read) and creativity. <BR>This book is a great, enjoyable read in many parts, but it fails to capture any of the joy of Motown. You are left feeling sorry for many of the artists you have come to love over the years. For this reason, I'm glad I saw &quot;Standing In The Shadows Of Motown&quot; before reading &quot;Motown: Money, Power...&quot;, for that movie is a celebration of the most important element of the Motown legacy - some of the best music ever recorded.	2002-12-24

(i.e., what does a South East Asian smile mean?) The maps of the cities and provinces are excellent. the all-important overland border-crossings between 'Nam, Laos, and Cambo are cleary marked. This is one of the many reasons that Moon can't be beaten at the moment. This guide's overland itineraries are the best. Example: you want to go into China overland fron northern Vietnam. How can you get up to Kunnming, China? It tells ya. And, we learn, that the one way flight into Bangkok from Kunming is the same price as the one that flys from Hanoi. (This price equality of course must be verified). <br />The information regarding the pricing and existence of certain establishments that cater to travelers is outdated. However, where to eat or sleep has never been an important part of a book anyhow, just the general information about the area in general and how to get there is all a visitor needs. Does someone need to read a guidebook to decide specifically where to eat? Where to specifically sleep? If it does for you, do everyone a favor: stay home. <br />The underlying story that provides the \\"general-informational\\" foundation is enough. When we come through town, understandably we don't know much, but that is far better than knowing absolutely nothing at all, which is quite common now from my conversations with tourists, and especially now among \\"backpackers.\\" The purpose of why backpacking started has been lost for most.  <br />By the way, it is a fact that the communist government censors this guidebook.

But if you open it up and start reading, there seems as if there is something wrong: &quot;Wing Commander G. Leonard Cheshire arrived at the Royal Air Force's aerodrome at Woodhall Spa on the morning of April 24, 1944 ...&quot;  It is a surprising start to an amazing story, written by William Nothdurft, with a co-author credit to Josh Smith, the leader of the most recent expedition to find the Egyptian dinosaurs.  That expedition repeated the hunt in the area in 1911 by Ernst Stromer, a German physician who had caught the paleontology bug.  Throughout the book, Stromer's story is interwoven with Smith's, in a narrative that is more exciting than that about fossil hunting has any right to be.<br />Stromer's makeshift expedition was heroic.  He traveled to the Bahariya Oasis in the Saharan desert, specifically looking for fossils of ancient mammals, and was unprepared to send back the monstrous bone specimens he found.  He got back to Munich, but it was only after years of delay (the Great War didn't help) that he got all his specimens.  Eventually, as a result of British bombing raids in 1944, and because no one would heed his warnings that his fossils needed special protection, the specimens were lost when their museum was bombed.  No paleontologists returned to the uninviting Bahariya for decades, until Josh Smith, a graduate student, got the idea of going.  The book has an excellent account of the trip, the politicking for funds, the dangers of the field, and the excitement of making a scientific difference.<br />Besides being a history, and a personal account, however, _The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt_ tells how paleontology has been done in the past and is done now.  The bizarre roles of good luck and bad run through both Smith's and Stromer's endeavors.  Smith's expedition verified Stromer's findings and made their own, including the second most massive dinosaur known, _Paralititan stromeri_ (note the tribute in the species name).  It also shows the importance of the expedition to paleontology overall.  Smith and his fellow explorers were able to answer Stromer's riddle of how the huge meat-eating dinosaurs of the area found anything to eat; Stromer described mostly predators.  There were discoveries, too, about the ecosystem that is now desert; the geologists on the team (one of them Smith's wife) discovered that the best explanation for the varieties of dinosaur they found in the desert is that millions of years ago, it was not desert at all, but a coastal mangrove swamp.  There are plenty of surprises here, with an attractive cast of eager young paleontologists who take on the roles of fools rushing in where experts fear to tread.Smith's expedition verified Stromer's findings and made their own, including the second most massive dinosaur known, _Paralititan stromeri_ (note the tribute in the species name).

If you happen to turn on the TV and catch a Christian fundamentalist talking about UFOs, almost certainly they will say that the mysterious discs can be explained in terms of their association with Satan; that UFOS  are the lights of Lucifer, since he is identified in the Bible as being the God of the Light and the North Star.   Unfortunately, none of these men o the cloth have ever really bothered to investigate the thousands of reports o unidentified flying objects first and therefor should not really be discussing such things - especially if they have not read this book first!   I have read several of the UFO-Bible books that have previously been published (those by Jessup and Rev Stranges), but none of them get to the heart of the subject like this collection put together by UFO research veteran Tim Beckley.   Beckley has assembled a research team consisting of a minister, a Biblical scholar, an archaeologist and an Emmy Award Winning Journalist to search the Holy book for signs of ET visitation, and have seemingly made some startling discoveries.   One of the most unusual features of this book are the photographic reproduction of various religious paintings circa l3th and l4th centuries which seem to show UFOs hovering over Jesus, a painting of Mary with an obviously unexplained object over her shoulder hovering in the sky above a shephard.   The researchers ask if the Red Sea was perhaps parted by aliens attempting to save their Isrealite friends, and if the angel who appeared to Mary was not perhaps an ET sent from God to tell of the arrival of the Christ child.   Perhaps the most interesting section is on the appearance of UFOs above the Holy land and a chapter on the many sightings and actual contacts taking place in the region.   Sean Casteel interviews such UFO personalities as Whitley Strieber, Budd Hopkins,and Betty Andreasson concerning their abduction experiences and believes as balanced out by what Christianity may feel about this strange subject matter.  I would not only recommend this book to those of deep faith, but to UFO researches who want to round out their UFO collection with something perhaps abit more sensible than the usual channelings of Jesus which cannot be verified.	2002-12-06

The Crucified Jew is written with  emotion and bias, but not scholarship.  It  surpises me that it was published in its present form.  The author cites references and quotes throughout the book but uses no footnotes or endnotes so nothing can be verified or reviewed.  He exhibits a poor understanding of Christianity and the Bible.  For example he says that according to the Church Fathers the Jews have been an apostate people.  Yet, it is not the Church Fathers who determined that, the entire Old Testament (God himself) testifies to their apostasy.  Sherbok views the New Testament as anti-Judaism and never considers the fact that criticism of the Jewish leaders may have been valid.  He accuses the Christians of calling Jews demons when it was the Jewish leaders who first called Jesus himself a demon (something never  mentioned in the book).  He says elements of the New Testament were added later for \\"polemic\\" purposes, implying they are not true.  However, he offers no support for this charge.   <br />Sherbok advocates  \\"Open Judaism\\" (See the book \\"Future of Judaism\\") in which Jews do not have to believe in God, or anything, to be Jewish.  This explains his distrust of Scripture because the Word of God does not have to believed, either.  This book has some good information, facts, etc.  But it is very opinionated and devoid of scholarly support.  Accusations are made as if they are truth when in fact they are his interpretation and opinion.  Unfortunately the author does not convey this to the reader.	2002-12-05

But what is a &quot;complete introduction&quot; to NLP? In their book 'Introducing NLP', authors O'Connor and Seymour give what they describe as a 'Three Minute Seminar' on NLP. That might equally qualify as a &quot;complete introduction&quot; to NLP, depending on your interpretation of the words &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;introduction&quot;.<BR>And does the word &quot;complete&quot; apply to &quot;introduction&quot; only, or to the rest of the subtitle? In either case I'd seriously question its accuracy.<br />And what about the claim, in the Foreward, that:<br />&quot;[the authors] have synthesised the NLP practitioner information and brought a new clarity to the field. ... While Harry and Beryl are not the developers of NLP, they play a critical role in moving NLP to the next level.&quot;<br />It turns out that all this comment means is: \\"The authors got an NLP book published by a mainstream publisher.\\"  Yes they did, but rather a long time (several years) after O'Connor and Seymour, so hardly a \\"critical role\\".<br />This book is, in fact, a rather verbose and not particularly competent introduction to the SOME of the basics of NLP. A &quot;training programme&quot; it is NOT, for the same reason that no book is a training programme - human beings learn very little just by reading about it. Especially in this particular field of activity.<br />I personally found the writing uninspired, conveying nothing of the 'magic' of NLP. Moreover, having decided to write the whole book in E-Prime (a fad if ever there was one!) the authors trap themselves in the kind of sentence construction that NLP highlights as being the basis of poor communication. For example, what did the authors mean by this statement:<br />&quot;Our personal mind programmes (sic) constitute the 'map'. They include so-called 'meta programmes' (sic), our higher-level thinking patterns such as our values, beliefs and other personality traits.&quot;<br />Is that supposed to mean that our &quot;personal mind programmes&quot; include meta programs AND our &quot;higher-level thinking patterns&quot;; or does it mean that &quot; 'meta programmes' (sic)&quot; ARE &quot;higher-level thinking patterns&quot;?<BR>And why is 'meta programs' spelt 'meta programmes'? Are the authors not aware that the 'program' in 'meta program' is adopted from computing terminology?<br />We also need to ask why the authors refer to them as &quot;so-called 'meta programmes'(sic)&quot;? Do they mean that meta programs aren't really meta programs in some sense? And is that why meta programs are almost totally ignored in this allegedly &quot;complete introduction&quot;?<br />Indeed, the more I read of this book, the more I wondered if the authors really knew what they were writing about.  For example, there are several references (more than the 6 referenced in the Index) to left and right brain activity, such as:<br />&quot;This calls upon natural, 'right brain' intuitive skills ...&quot;<br />Surely this myth of exclusivity in left and right brain activities was laid to rest years ago?<br />&quot;Neuro-Linguistic Programming builds on the ideas of the anthropologist Gregory Bateson.&quot;<br />What - the whole of NLP?  What about Satir, Erickson, Korzybski, Perls, etc., etc.?<br />The notion that &quot;Auditory Digital&quot; is a representational system in its own right, but apparently taste (gustatory) and smell (olfactory) no longer qualify.  Thus the original list of representational systems - visual, auditory, kinesthetic, Olfactory and Gustatory (VAKOG) - has been transformed, with no explanation, into VAKAd!<br />Then there is the very confused section on 'Switching Submodalities' where the authors quite rightly observe that: <br />&quot;Association tends to intensify a feeling. Conversely, recalling a traumatic experience in a dissociated way will typically cause less pain ...&quot;<br />but only after they have recommended that the reader switch to the associated state when recalling an unhappy memory in order to apply &quot;the 'happiness code' to the content. Such switching may work well under the direction of an experienced guide, but I seriously doubt the wisdom of recommending this course of action to a complete beginner.<br />And why does the discussion of The Convincer Strategy (day 17) cover convincer modes (what kind of evidence is convincing) but not convincer channels (how frequently or for how long the evidence must be encountered to become convincing)? <br />Returning to Bateson, on page 197 the authors state that &quot;the anthropologist Gregory Bateson originated a model of neurological levels, later developed by Robert Dilts as shown in figure 14.1.&quot;<br />Not actually true, I'm afraid, for the following reasons:<br />Bateson invented a model of &quot;logical levels of learning - which had to do with levels of abstraction (learning, learning about learning, learning about learning about learning, and so on) - which has nothing to do with neurological levels.<BR>On the contrary, where Bateson's model is both logical and about &quot;levels&quot;, the Dilts model isn't logical, and doesn't feature any true \\"levels\\".<br /> Moreover, the illustration in figure 14.1 isn't the Neurological Levels model at all, though the authors keep calling it that. It is, in fact, just the plain Logical Levels model, a fact that is easily verified since the illustration doesn't include a single one of the 'nervous system' labels that are in Dilts' Neurological Levels model.<br />Having said all that, its only fair to mention that there are several passages in the text which must stand out as worthwhile in anybody's book (!). I'm particularly thinking of the section entitled 'Soft Front Ends', which gives some very useful advice on how to ask meta model questions with sensitivity; of the exercises at the end of thechapter on metaphors; and of 'ALIGNMENT', a section which demonstrates how to apply the idea of neurological levels to real life situations.<br />Unfortunately, for the reasons stated above I really wouldn't be happy about recommending this book to a complete novice. And unless you are a complete novice I can't see any reason to read something this basic. Especially when you consider that O'Connor and Seymour's 'Introducing NLP' is more accurate, more complete, and cheaper!<BR>In short, definitely 'Not Recommended'.	2002-12-04

The events that unfolded at 112 Ocean Avenue on the night of November 13, 1974, far from being supernatural or demonic, are revealed as all too human in origin.  This so-called ghost story has been once again been revealed a shoddy hoax on the part of George and Kathy Lutz, concocted for fame and fortune (as a sidebar, Mr. Lutz admitted on the Lou Gentile radio show in May of 2002 that the \\"non-fiction\\" book sequels to the novel \\"The Amityville Horror\\" were in fact false despite the labeling to the contrary, helpfully establishing himself as a dishonest profiteer who promoted myth in exchange for money).  Congratulations are in order to Mr. Osuna for cutting through the hype, the superstition, and the mythology that has surrounded this subject for over 25 years.<br />Mr. Osuna presents compelling new information about the DeFeo family, all of which is verified through independent sources, detailing the murders and the reasoning behind the hoax that followed.  He is no \\"armchair investigator\\" but someone who obviously hit the streets of Amityville to do his own legwork.  Mr. Osuna talked to surviving DeFeo members to get the inside details, reviewed official documents, and interviewed outside witnesses to get to the heart of the matter.<br />The \\"Amityville Horror\\" has always been a hotly debated topic, and like any other issue of contention has attracted an array of interested followers.   Those who are open-minded, intelligent, and eager to review all facts will love Mr. Osuna's book and will quite likely be unable to put it down until they've turned the last page.  However, like the \\"Roswell UFO\\" matter this subject has also reeled in an amusing fringe element of deluded fanatics, some of whom are acquaintances or perhaps business partners with the Lutz family, who have decided to believe in \\"The Amityville Horror\\" not only without the benefit of evidence to support their conclusions, but in spite of all contrary material that endangers their perspective on this case.  In order for them to achieve this end they must continue to insist that the DeFeo murders were caused by demonic influences which possessed Ronald DeFeo.  No possession means no haunting, and they can't have this in order for their fictional ghost story to fly, which means Mr. Osuna's book is quite dangerous to some who don't wish to be confused with facts.  The tactics of this unpleasant collection of obsessed juveniles involves a careful distortion and/or disruption of the dissemination of the truth in this case.  The pathetic bag of tricks utilized time and again by these cultists routinely involve slander, smear campaigns and dishonest claims and/or comments directed towards anyone who might condemn this story as being a fabrication.  Dr. Stephen Kaplan was similarly targeted by small minded embittered devotees of the Lutzes after he went public with the truth regarding the fallacies of this ghost story, and no doubt they will do the same in regards to Mr. Osuna's work (whether or not they have actually read it).  Hostile remarks directed towards Mr. Osuna, which might appear without elaboration or specific examples that may appear throughout this book review section should be taken as merely a testimony to the efficacy as well as accuracy of Mr. Osuna's illimunating work.<br />For anyone who is interested in separating fantasy from fact, falsehoods from truths, and myth from reality, this book will please and entertain tremendously.	2002-12-02

However, there are several reasons for it, and few, if any, of them are the author's fault. His intent is to keep the series accessible to as wide an audience as possible.<br />The first two volumes, which I recommend in the combined anniversary edition, go through the organization of guitar as an instrument, with the promise of actual music coming into play at a later time. Well, this volume is where the music not introduced in the second volume comes in.<br />Applications - Creative and Analytical (ACaA) is not necessarily something to be read in sequence. Rather, it is something to refer to as an encyclopedia, upon need of certain elements. If you're anything like me, you may find that you will buy this book for 20 out of the 170 pages of it, and end up using the rest just to make yourself feel that you haven't wasted any money.<br />ACaA goes through the fundamentals of music theory in this book. He uses guitar, not piano, to expain them, which is a bonus, but learning, or re-learning, to read standard notation may be a bit of a drag. Not that it isn't worth it, but it's something that can be acquired in other sources. It's not that difficult.<br />Another thing ACaA covers are technical development exercises, particularly for lead playing. Again, something we can easily find elsewhere. Rhythmic and melodic exercises, same thing. In short, there is a lot of material that, unlike the stuff in the first two volumes, can be found in other places in a duplicate fashion - Mr. Edwards simply adjusts it to his teaching style.<br />ACaA also includes some original compositions by Mr. Edwards, which is a nice addition, but the analytical application takes away from the creative aspect - having the tool (the guitar), to discover the music for oneself and growwith it. I've seen bands with guitarists who have mastered this approach - their playing is quite bland, with very little spark to it. In other words, this third volume is insufficient to make one a great guitarist, not just a great guitar player.<br />There is a very useful section on chord progressions, from which any player would benefit, and which all fans of volumes I and II will love. And to give credit where credit is due, there are many great pedagogical techniques in this volume, which are worth looking at, even if only academically. Also, there is a ton of great advice regarding learning techniques for everyone in this book, so don't write it off based on its negative aspects.<br />Also, on a negative note, there is a number of typographical errors in this book, which, unless you already know the concept being explained, might give you a little trouble.<br />To conclude, this book is something to consider. However, as Plato notes, be careful with logic - use it only once you've verified that the axioms of your system are true. I will use similar advice: use this book well, but don't limit yourself to it.	2002-12-01

The Art of Happiness: a Handbook for Living, by Howard C. Cutler, MD and His Holiness the Dalai Lama is a collection of insight and conversations from the authors.  The Dalai Lama gave public talks in Arizona, which Mr. Cutler attended, and they also had many private conversations both in America and while traveling in India.  Based on these conversations, Mr. Cutler composed his text, which is intended to be a guide to eliminating the obstacles to and finding happiness.  They feel that happiness is determined more by one's state of mind rather than external events, and you can train yourself to change the common practices that lead to an unhappy state of mind.<BR> I found the ideas in this book very interesting as well as practical and logically consistent.  I think that this text defends their point very strongly.  They argue the premise that through having a positive outlook and avoiding, or gaining a new perspective on, negative events, we can personally control our level of happiness.  <BR>  The authors provide a good, inductively strong argument.  I say this because although the reasoning is good, it is possible to imagine some situations in which a person could not successfully employ these practices.  I believe that the basic premise is true; your perspective does strongly shape your level of contentment.  The Dalai Lama explains, \\"While undergoing rigorous training, an athlete may suffer a lot... but the athlete doesn't see it as a painful experience.  The athlete would take it as a great accomplishment... but if the same person were subject to some other physical work that was not part of his athletic training, then the athlete would think, `Oh, why have I been subjected to this terrible ordeal?' So the mental attitude makes a tremendous difference\\" (Cutler 118). <BR> The Dalai Lama offers several more suggestions for cultivating a better outlook.  One is to act with compassion toward every person that you meet.  He suggests trying to relate to them on the basic level that you are both human.  Connecting on this level opens doors to other connections, and it is one basic quality that we all have.  Learning to connect with others on this level will allow you to have a happier outlook.  He explains the idea in the following passage.  \\"In generating compassion, you start by recognizing that you do not want suffering and you have a right to have happiness.  This can be verified or validated by your own experience.  You recognize then that other people, just like yourself, also do not want to suffer and that they have a right to have happiness.  So this becomes the basis of your beginning to generate compassion\\" (Cutler 128).  <BR> Suffering and problems in our lives are one of the obstacles to happiness.  This too, he suggests, can be controlled by outlook.  Accepting that suffering will be a part of your life can prepare you for it; it will make you more tolerant, less overwhelmed when bad events come about.  \\"Without a certain degree of tolerance toward suffering, your life becomes miserable; the it becomes like having a very bad night.  That night seems eternal, it never seems to end\\" (Cutler 141).<BR> The claims that the authors make are very well supported, and they are explained very clearly and thoroughly.  This book does a particularly good job of taking all evidence into account and addressing opposing arguments and views.  In the beginning, Mr. Cutler is a skeptic of the method as well.  He assails the Dalai Lama with endless questions, turning his theory inside and out.  However, the Dalai Lama responds each time with well thought out, logically consistent replies.  This makes the argument particularly convincing; you are able to follow Mr. Cutler in his thought process of eventually accepting this theory.    <BR> Overall, I found this argument to be very sound, with no real logical fallacies.  The authors do an excellent job of explaining the basic premise that our perception controls our mood, and they are fair in taking into account that some people may not be able to control their mood.  They also address that cultivating this new outlook and making real changes takes a long period of time; it will always be a developing process.  The authors provide a very solid argument that finding happiness is something that is possible for us all.<br />References<BR>H.H. the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler, MD.

I loved Juanita and the nerve she shows in standing up for her own survival, realizing that she has somehow been enabling her children to use her (any good mom tries to do for them, right?) and figuring out what is needed to save both her children and herself.  She's sorry for the mistakes she's made but not willing to be suffocated by them.  Cheers for Juanita!  This was a nice, cold-weather-by-the-fireplace-under-a-quilt story.  There were a few places where I wished for a little more of the fine, liquid, story-telling qualities to stay.  Mainly, when she first meets her new love interest, the vehemence she displays, indeed, at almost every word from him, is just not verified.  She is a woman on a quest but the nasty outbursts don't seem to fit with the way her character was created.  She just does't seem that unbalanced and angry and with all her other encounters, she is patient and sympathetic.  I guess it was supposed to show how he put her on edge from the start, but for me there wasn't enough motivation for ripping his head off at every turn and constantly (annoyingly) throwing anything loose at him every time he opened his mouth.  Maybe she's trying to show who's boss before they get started?  the constantly flying towels, fruit, etc seemed like she was stepping into the aggressor's role of abuse that she had run from time after time.  Still, that aside, and it was a small part of the book, the story was carried out in a slick, tight format, and was a nice way to spend a few hours.  I liked the book over all and look forward to this author's coming career.	2002-11-29

It's a jagged tale of startling incoherence that binds one to it until the last page. Along the road \\"you\\", \\"I\\" and \\"she\\" meet interesting people and examine interesting themes, which consistently diverge from one another. It starts with \\"you\\" in a dirty bus stop and ends with \\"I\\" comprehending and understanding nothing. A truly fascinating tale of humanity and the forces that shape people and their times, a worthy winner of the Nobel and a wonderful read for the brave at heart.<br />The novel is a nostalgic monument to ancient themes in a modern time. He paints verbal pictures of ancient traditions and places that rest on the mind and leave a warm, comforting feeling within the depths of the reader. His portrayal of ancient and unforgotten traditions and practices that survived the cultural revolution resonate through the mind and leave a trace of envy and a sense of \\"I wish I could see it too\\" attitude. It's a novel in which the author tries not to forget his roots nor from where he came but also tries to grasp reality and the meaning of life, love and theology.<br />Gao takes on the task of examining reality leaving the reader unsure of what is and isn't real. The author asserts that \\"it is impossible to disentangle imagination from experience\\" and elsewhere asks \\"where is the boundary between memory and wishful thinking? How can the two be separated? Which of the two is more real and how can this be determined?\\" Even the main characters in the plot are not real but mere reflections of each other \\"you\\" is the reflection \\"I\\" created, and \\"she\\" was created by \\"you\\" and \\"he\\" is the back of \\"you\\".<br />Other expressions of reality are found throughout the narrative. The author talks about \\"reality existing through experience\\" and emphasizes \\"personal experience\\" but then infers that \\"reality cannot be verified and does not need to be.\\" The author makes a startling conclusion that \\"reality is myself, and that reality is the perception of this instant and it can't be related to another person.\\" In the end any reality that is portrayed is \\"distorted\\" since the author \\"had been unable to portray real life.\\"  The reader is never sure where they are or what is true or false yet certain that they are hearing something.<br />But the novel, as I assume the author did, loses love. \\"She\\" says \\"love is an illusion which people conjure up to delude themselves. You don't believe in the existence of something called love; it is either the man possessing the woman or the woman possessing the man.\\"<br />A novel of such magnitude cannot leave out an examination of religion and God. \\"Soul Mountain\\" attempts to trace religion from the \\"a vestige of early human civilization; the worship of fire\\" through to the authors conclusion when \\"I\\" sees a \\"small green frog\\" and \\"knows this is God.\\" But \\"I\\" honestly admits that he doesn't \\"know if God, and the Devil in fact exist but both were invoked by you who are the embodiment of both my good fortune and my misfortune.\\" Gao admits later on (in reference to folk songs) that \\"what should be revered isn't revered and instead all sorts of things are worshipped.\\"<br />In this examination of faith he confronts the reality that the Chinese \\"government doesn't allow of superstitious practices.\\" In spite of these inhibitions he takes his reader into the realm of ancient religious traditions that are still invisible to the western eye.<br />This is a monumental search for the self, humanity, history, culture and identity. It is cast against the morass of the vast expanse of China. Eventually \\"the act of searching itself turns into a sort of goal, and the object of the search is irrelevant\\" and the \\"true traveler is without goal, it is the absence of goals which creates the ultimate traveler.\\" Gao is the ultimate traveler but I am left to think that Gao's own search has led him to the vacuous belief that \\"life is joyous, death is joyous, it is nothing more than your memories.\\" If this is what life is, then I too would \\"wail\\" with Gao and (in the words of the author) it would be the \\"wail of accumulated sadness being released.\\"aveler but I am left to think that Gao's own search has led him to the vacuous belief that \\"life is joyous, death is joyous, it is nothing more than your memories.\\" If this is what life is, then I too would \\"wail\\" with Gao and (in the words of the author) it would be the \\"wail of accumulated sadness being released.\\"	2002-11-26

I suppose you can say this claim is not true anymore, because this book collects the know-how from the perldocs, the newsgroups, the camel book (and other resources) and the personal experience of authors of the book.<br />Finally, you don't have to pick up small pieces of information about this subject in many places as people did prior to this book. What one would do, if one wanted to learn how to extend Perl or embed Perl before this book was available was doing one or more of the following:<br />  * Read relevant small parts of the Camel book (preferably the recent edition rather than the 1st or 2nd) and \\"Advanced Perl Programming\\" (which is rather old, and only touches this matters).<br />  This would give you some idea about Perl internals and perhaps some clues about XS, but that's about it.<br />  * browse through newsgroups, mail archives and mailing lists to look for clues, and ask expert users, which usually, are not polite to answer newbies questions about such matters.<br />  * figure out some cryptic (though, personally, I like them) incomplete (examples-wise) perldocs such as:<br />  perlembed, perldebguts, perlxstut, perlxs,<br />  perlclib, perlguts, perlcall, perlapi,<br />  perlintern, perliol, perlapio, perlhack<br />* locate and dig into available CPAN module using this technology.<br />I think reading one book, with common terminology and many examples, is better than doing one or more of the above.<br />The book starts with an introduction of C for Perl programmers. It is very short and in my opinion not so accurate (due to its shortness), but since this should be a short introduction - it lives up to the promise. You can write a lot more than a \\"hello world\\" program after reading this short chapter, and you get a bonus, how to compile on gcc (gcc is ANSI-C and is available for all platforms), which is a wise idea. Perl programmers might be a bit disappointed to discover how much code and how complicated code you need to write in C to produce something that does the same as any Perl oneliner. The third chapter about Advanced C is a very good continuation to this introduction, especially, becuase the authors can assume you know some Perl (although I'm not sure they do). As someone giving lectures in \\"introduction to Computer Science, C language\\", I was tempted to borrow several very nice examples and explenations from this chapter. And I might also do that :-)<br />The next chapter explains how C code can be incorporated into a Perl Module and more generally into a CPAN package of a Perl module. This is very useful. Many resources (including books), focus on writing C/Perl code, and they say nothing or next to nothing about packaging (what you should do in order to make sure others can use your code, what you can and can't assume about the target system, etc.)<br />The fourth chapter is a useful cover of Perl variable types. This is somehting you could find in the \\"camel book\\", you can also find this in the (rather old) \\"Advanced Perl Programming\\", and of course in perldocs - but having it in one place, in order with examples and explenations is a real joy. Now you can figure it our reading one thing, and if you feel you want more, go to the perldocs.<br />Explaining Perl API, XS and advanced XS, alternatives to XS explain how you can add to your Perl programs some code (or programs or libraries) in C. I, personally wanted to have a module in Perl that gives interface to a data structure. Since the implementation I had is in C and it is tested and verified, I wanted to have a Perl module which exports the functionality, and offers a perl-oriented interface, without needing to reimplement the data structure in Perl. These book chapters made all the difference, and with the knowlede in chapter 2, I can now finish this, and after doing my testing, put it on CPAN. Isn't that great?!<br />If you are interested in doing the opposite, write Perl in C code, you can learn it in chapter 8. And if theory does not meet practice, you can read chapter 9 (and also try it out yourself) which presents a case study. Pretty useful stuff.<br />For people who are taking their first steps, the material so far is more than enough. But once you go deeper you want to know more about how to do more complicated stuff, and how stuff actually works. Chapter 10 which introduces you to the Perl internals is just what you would be looking for. Chapter 11 will be the tour into the depts, teaching you some perl hacking, i.e. how to alter Perl's behaviour.<br />The indices are useful, though can be found (though, not in similar format) elsewhere.<br />To sum this review, I loved the book. I wish I could take more time to practice what I read there thoroughly. I will surely get a copy of this book to have it on my bookshelf, and when the need comes, on my desk.de in chapter 2, I can now finish this, and after doing my testing, put it on CPAN.

He does this, as historians before him have done, by examining the broad periods of history as they are associated with the tools and natural materials used in each. Then, once more knowledge is gained through further study and research, the periods in history can be broken down even further. The focal point of the book shows that, by studying ancient history and generalizing the past, one can use archeological evidence to construct a society for each place. Detail is added when facts are discovered and verified. Archeological findings are often things the ancients used, such as tools and pottery that they made out of natural substances in their local area. Historians and archeologists formulate answers to questions about who lived where, when, and why, and to discuss their relationships to other contemporaries. The author examines section by section Greece and examines it. The culture is revealed based on archeological discoveries that provide a basis for historical theories.  Key to a location's survival is its relationship to other contemporary places, and exchange of goods and survival allows for growth both intellectually and technologically. <BR>Finley originally published this book in 1970. He republished it in 1981 to incorporate new archeological discoveries. He has examined the ancient Greek world chronologically from Early Minoan to the Persian Wars from the social, economic, and political aspects. <BR>Archeological evidence is valuable for describing and dividing changes in antiquity. Divisions were created as advancements occurred. One example of an advancement cited by Finley is the burial ritual. Much can be learned about a society by studying the way they bury their dead. The Cyclades included marble idols in the graves. The Cretans did nothing majestic with their tombs. The gold disks the Mycenaeans buried in their shaft-graves and the later pottery found in Mycenaean Tholos-tombs help to date the burial sites. By studying advancements in burial designs of these different groups, one can decipher the stages of development for a group of people. After determining who was buried in the tombs, one can interpret who and what traits were more honored by the more decorative ornamentation found. <BR>When read along with a more in-depth and inclusive textbook designed to instruct the unfamiliar student with ancient times, this book is most helpful. It includes many terms assumed to be familiar but which are not, and therefore,  definitions of these terms are needed. By reading a supplementary list of terms and committing to memory many of the characters names, approaching the text became easier.	2002-11-20

It's VERY unfortunate that the author chose the &quot;historical novel&quot; format because it effectively destroys what could have been a serious work by a serious researcher.  &quot;Antonia,&quot; our heroine, revealed under hypnosis back in the 1970s and 1980s a mass of details concerning a past life during the Spanish Inquisition.  The author, who was the second hypnotherapist to work with Antonia, spent years (including trips to Spain) to verify the details.  Some of these could be verified only in genuinely obscure, non-English sources and are quite amazing.  The effort that the author put into this, and the seriousness of her research, are apparent in the Introduction and the End Notes -- which, unfortunately, are the only parts of the book that I found interesting.  She says that she chose the &quot;historical novel&quot; format because the events as described in the hypnosis sessions were disjointed and she didn't want to bore us with a series of verbatim transcripts as in The Search for Bridey Murphy.  Unfortunately (I seem to be over-using that word), verbatim transcripts can be RIVETING while this reads like an inane Harlequin Romance (which I'm familiar with only because my wife was hooked on them until I told her I'd set fire to the house if she brought home one more; drastic problems call for drastic solutions).  Anyway, if you can force yourself to wade through this, you can be assured that it's based on serious research and could have been a lot better.  It reminds me of Mark Twain's comment about composer Richard Wagner:  &quot;Wagner's music is really a lot better than it sounds.&quot;  Unfortunately, ...	2002-11-20

I agree with most critics that the case Cornwell presents is less definitive than she wants us to believe. But I still find it convincing.  The fact that Sickert's letter's mitochondrial DNA matches that on the Ripper's letter is a stunning piece of evidence.  Even if the match still leaves .01-10% of the population that can't be excluded, it narrows the field of suspects dramatically. The Ripper used expensive paper and artists' supplies for some of his writings. Sickert titled a painting of his own bedroom \\"Jack the Ripper's bedroom\\". (Yes, I know the story that his landlady supposedly told him that a previous tenant was the Ripper, but that explanation can't be verified and seems like a very suspicious coincidence). He painted scenes of violence against women. He was appallingly insensitive and selfish to those closest to him.  His sketches look very similar to many Ripper sketches.  These are just a FEW of the many \\"coincidences\\" Cornwell cites. Yes, none of these are convincing in isolation, but when you put them all together the case against Sickert becomes very strong. As for the many reasons that have been cited to \\"prove\\" Sickert could not have been the Ripper, most of them are pure opinion (such as saying that certain Ripper letters that had Sickert-type DNA are hoaxes). If the Ripper had the artistic talent Cornwell asserts, it would've been easy enough for him to fake his handwriting and use many different styles of writing to confuse. One reason the Ripper was never caught was that no one of that class-conscious era could fathom an upper class, attractive, charming man committing such heinous crimes. Perhaps some of Cornwell's critics are letting their own snobbery get in the way of their common sense. <BR>However, I do take issue with Cornwell's style. She jumps around chronologically in a confusing way, intersperses her biographical data with opinions and asides on forensics, cites facts and opinions without having laid the groundwork to help the reader understand them, and just generally does not organize the book very well. It seems hastily thrown together. I was particularly disappointed that she did not explain how or why she eliminated other suspects, and how she became so convinced that Sickert was the murderer that she subtitled the book \\"case closed\\".	2002-11-18

Dr. Feinberg describes a political scandal as anything in a public officials professional or personal life that defies the code of conduct Americans set for themselves. She astutely notes that since morals change, so may the behavior thought sufficient to reach scandal status. She excludes scandals that do not involve political or personal morality (although many early scandals such as the Peggy Eaton Affair seem to fall outside this scope), and does not discuss unverified accusations.  Thus, she mentions (in Chapter 1) that there is no mention of the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings or the charge that the release of hostages in Iraq was timed to influence the 1980 election.<br />For the most part, the book focuses on egregious and important scandals, along with a few of the more vivid episodes (e.g., the beating of Senator Sumner in the Senate Chamber, and the Hamilton/Burr duel) to keep things interesting.  Dr. Feinberg categorizes the many scandals into Violent Political Quarrels, Controversial Election Returns,  Affairs of the Heart, Political Office for Personal Profit, Public Displays of Personal Misconduct, and Abuse of Power. Unfortunately, the book predates the impeachment of Clinton, and the 2002 election irregularities, although there is an excellent section on the abuses of Iran-Contra (although the defense position is not discussed).  She wisely concludes, although the government is not scandal proof, it is not permanently scandal-ridden, and she reminds readers of the governmental and journalistic checks against scandal.  Although limited by its brevity, Dr. Feinberg presents three theories about the prevalence of scandal in the Grant, Harding, Nixon, and Reagan eras.

THE LITTLE FRIEND, her long awaited second novel, exceeds all expectations. And, while we may never know the reasons for the wide gap between the two books, only the results matter . Suffice it to say, the lady has outdone herself, and her latest effort has been worth the wait.<br />The setting is Alexandria, Mississippi where the Dufresne/Cleve families, suffered a terrible tragedy that changed the course of their lives irrevocably. One Mother's Day, Robin, their nine-year-old son was murdered. \\"Mrs. Fountain saw him first.\\" Her screams brought Charlotte Cleve Dufrense, his mother, running, \\"He was hanging by the neck from a piece of rope, slung over the low branch of the black-tupelo that stood near the overgrown privet hedge [that divided the Dufrense property from the Fountain's] he was dead.\\"<br />The only possible \\"witnesses\\" to his murder were his younger sisters, Allison, who was four years old and the baby, Harriet. If they saw anything it was buried in the deepest recesses of their psyches, not to be recovered. For years the townspeople buzzed and gossiped speculating about who could be responsible for such a horrendous crime. Suspicion was everywhere and nowhere, and in the end, the investigation was dropped.<br />Robin's family never discussed his brutal murder; rather, they chose to remember him as a lively, lovable little boy, who brought joy to those whose lives he touched. hether or not their anecdotal remembrances were real was never an issue, ....<br />Harriet's mother never quite forgave herself for Robin's death and she withdrew into an \\"&#133;indifference that numbed and colored every area of her life,\\" and her older daughter, Allison, followed her into the same dreamy netherworld. Dix Cleve, the adulterous absentee father, moved to another state and only occasionally came home to visit.<br />But his absence transmogrified the Dufrense/Cleves into a matriarchal family whose driving force is Charlotte's mother, Edith, the children's fierce, no-nonsense grandmother. Edith's sisters make up the rest of the clan and they are Harriet's support system. They all live within walking distance of each other and when Harriet needs comfort or company she turns to her great aunts who welcome her kindly.<br />Tartt establishes all of this with languid prose that propels the reader into the action twelve years after Robin's death. Harriet, already a force a to reckon with is smart, snobbish, angry, manipulating, independent, fiercely loyal and very strong. She is a misfit among her peers, she doesn't share their interests, she is a scholar by nature and has only one friend, Hely Hull, a boy who idolizes her and would do anything for her.<br />Together the two pals devise a plan to avenge Robin's death. Harriet commits herself with obsessive tunnel vision to finding the killer. With snippets of unverified rumors she focuses her outrage on one man, which puts her and Hely in the center of a tangled web of danger, deceit, destruction and death.<br />Tartt's detailed depiction of the mores of life in a small southern town, with an underbelly as corrupt and dangerous as any urban center, throbs with pathos. She has given readers a provocative novel which is interesting and suspenseful; part murder mystery, part coming of age tale, part a child's story, part a story of loyalty and friendship, part an interlocutory on the American justice system, part a study in southern culture and mores, part a commentary on the little ways families chip away at themselves, especially in the face of tragedy or death, only to find their center implodes and leaves a haunting void in its wake.<br />Of the major motif Tartt says, \\"This is a book about children, but it's not a book for children. It's a frightening book. It's a scary book. It's fairly dark. It's about children coming into contact with adults ... and coming into contact with the world of adults in a very frightening way.\\" She also maintains, time and patience are the most important elements a writer must cultivate in order to do \\"it\\" perfectly. She admits that she writes slowly and says; too, \\"There are no real messages in my fiction. The first duty of the novelist is to entertain. It is a moral duty.\\" And these beliefs, put into practice, is precisely what makes THE LITTLE FRIEND such a rich, passionate book in the spirit of Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, while at the same time, it is imbued with the dark humor and loss of innocence vividly portrayed in HARRIET THE SPY.<br />THE LITTLE FRIEND is a treasure and readers can only hope that Ms. Tartt doesn't take ten years to produce another gem.<br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum	2002-11-09

Because of this, you have to be alert and in full thinking mode in order to link all of the texts and different genres together. There is much mystery from the first chapter of the book and it only gets more mysterious as the book progresses, introducing more questions and more confusion. You may think that the book is too hard to follow when you start to read it however if you are keen enough to read on, it gets much easier to follow the story line and the book itself. The story line will no doubt startle you when you try to categorise it as fiction, non-fiction, fantasy or science fiction since you will most probably not know if the events actually happened or not. The whole story line is worked around the historical event of the Batavia shipwreck that happened in 1629. Gary Crew has integrated many facts into the novel that can be verified as being non-fiction but there are many things that cannot be verified being fact so it is left for you to decide or to find out.<br />Steven Messenger is a teenager from rural Australia who stumbles across relics from the Batavia shipwreck in a cave during a school biology excursion. This relic contains crucial information about the past and has historical remains of people. A journal, which was written by one of the Batavia castaways, was found among the relics and is translated from Old Dutch into Modern English. Throughout the book, a parallel can be seen between events that happened in the Batavia castaways in 1629 and what is happening in the present and this also poses even more questions. Steven Messenger has possession of an important piece of the puzzle and he refuses to declare it to the professionals in the historical field. Steven finds the ring to have a power to change his dreams and to send him messages where he dreams about the past and other weird and wonderful things. Nigel Kratzman is Steven Messengersneighbour and may even be his only friend and may be the only person who is willing to help Steven with what is happening around him.<br />This book is no doubt the kind of book that you have to be constantly thinking about how to piece together the information that is given to you and to sift out what is truth and what has been manipulated in some way or another. As another reader from Adelaide has mentioned in one of his reviews, Youll only get out of it, what you put into it!	2002-11-08

The result is the chronic ideological factor, left and right, in the collation of historical and evolutionary theory. All parties seem oblivious to the absurdity of political point arguments using assumptions of Darwinian adaptationism, and selectionist speculation. Pinker's new work on evolutionary psychology is remarkable in its direct and yet, remarkably, unwitting muddle of these domains. The weak position of the typical 'blank slate' position which Pinker nimbly criticizes distracts attention from the sheer audacity of the clearly conservatizing gesture, in the lineage of E.O. Wilson.<br />Let us breathe a sign of relief. It is highly unlikely there is or could be a 'science' of human nature. Thus our only problem is to wake up the proponents of each new brand of scientism in this regard.  Controlling by definition or science the nature of 'human nature' is a dangerous business. We might well recall the short work the original Rousseau made of such nonsense (granting the equal nonsense sometimes made of his own views).<br /> We need a theory that can show how man's actions in history evolve in relation to values, and this in relation to possible scenarios of the Paleolithic. Darwin's theory is stillborn and unable to provid that transitional mixture and nosedives into its 'slow change' conservatism applied to modern politics (the left is often no better). It is obsessed with its improperly verified selectionist claims.<br />Such things ought to be embarassing but instead they pass as science. Darwinism especially suffers this problem as the 'mechanism of natural selection' as emergentist process is misapplied to value issues, speculation restated as fact, and the result is the bedlam of ideological entanglement in the 'blank slate/human nature' debate as this betrays its ideological character at every point, starting with the now archetypical 'Rousseau bashing' of the sociobiologists who have missed the point about the Noble Savage. The genetic revolution, however, is still a work in progress, so what's in fact is the point?<br />But one can only say good riddance to such an extreme view as the Blank Slate in its straw man version, and shrug at the suggestion that something like a 'human nature' has a genetic component, mindful that for all its flaws the blank slate stance was a justified caution near the catastrophic abuse of Darwinian racism characteristic of this century. This field is dangerous, and has a criminal record, and Pinker's indignation at our caution is not really justified. Having declared in part for human nature, we should ask who can define it, and how, and how did its definition become outright political football? The basic issue is the inadequacy of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Without that mechanism, reask the question, What is human nature, please? Millennia of men, for example, have held beliefs in the soul, and the technocratic definition of man,which Rousseau foresaw with dread, and speaking oneself as a secularist, is simply presumptuous in the extreme if it thinks that Darwinian selectionism can settle this issue in the negative. The crackpot secularism thinking it has Darwinian grounds to outlaw these 'superstitions' will end in a collision. The question is not even spiritual in its Buddhist version, the material soul being an aspect of quite another 'evolutionary psychology', fully atheist and materialist, as seen in the ancient Jainism. By the way, how and when did such commonsensical evolutionary psychologies evolve themselves, to be visible at such an early date? The point is that we know virtually nothing about the full scope of the true version of the Descent of Man. These are the fatal limits of Darwinism. We should not be confusing the theory of how things evolved, especially if their evidence is inadequate, with how things should be now and in the future, or the result is the flaunting of wretched whiggery so evident in Pinker's denial of ideology, with its standard debunking of the 'utopian nonsense'. Reviewing books on evolution can become repetitive: it is always the same problem, natural selection run riot as an explanatory device of theory. Thus it is tempting to join the fray on particulars, but this results in chaotification of discourse, a characteristic of the Blank Slate proponents, now in retreat, seemingly, in the genetic revolution. Since the technocratic redefinition of man has succeeded in imposing this Darwinian belief system, with insufficient evidence, one feels a sense of helplessness in joining the fray. One can only say, be wary. The nature of man, and his human nature, cannot be determined properly with Darwin's theory. Since this point can no longer be defended properly in public, one simply goes underground like a Buddhist.<br /> In general, the assault on ethical evolution with reductionist methods, as with group or kin selection models, are continually presented and promoted as 'fait accompli', already proven, when in fact they are simply speculative extensions trying to save basic Darwinian assumptions. Student in broader humanistic fields are not under any obligation to take them as established. These confusions are as old as the nineteenth century, and the legacy of positivism.

Reviewing books on evolution can become repetitive: it is always the same problem, natural selection run riot as an explanatory device of theory. Thus it is tempting to join the fray on particulars, but this results in chaotification of discourse, a characteristic of the Blank Slate proponents, now in retreat, seemingly, in the genetic revolution. Since the technocratic redefinition of man has succeeded in imposing this Darwinian belief system, with insufficient evidence, one feels a sense of helplessness in joining the fray. One can only say, be wary. The nature of man, and his human nature, cannot be determined properly with Darwin's theory. Since this point can no longer be defended properly in public, one simply goes underground like a Buddhist.<BR> In general, the assault on ethical evolution with reductionist methods, as with group or kin selection models, are continually presented and promoted as 'fait accompli', already proven, when in fact they are simply speculative extensions trying to save basic Darwinian assumptions. Student in broader humanistic fields are not under any obligation to take them as established. These confusions are as old as the nineteenth century, and the legacy of positivism. They spring from a refusal or blindness near the limits of theory. Their complexity is mesmerizing, and that makes their flaws difficult to see.

In the hands of an enthusiastic and overly trusting beginner, this book could lead to mass wealth destruction.<br />I programmed and tested many of the patterns Mr. Williams promoted but could not duplicate the results he claims to have achieved, even though I used the same time periods, same timeframes and same system parameters he indicated. Also, many of the patterns that are put forth as generating &gt; 80% profitable trades are heavily optimized and filtered for the purpose of presentation in this book. Using TradeStation for back-testing, I could not get even one of the recommended patterns to perform above 20% efficiency.<br />My goal in writing this review is not to criticize Mr. Williams but rather to warn budding traders that reliance on such convincing, well-told material as this can get you into a lot of trouble. With all due respect to Mr. Williams and his heavily advertised record as a trader and systems developer, let us all understand that he has built a substantial business around training others to trade. I suspect that the bulk of his income is generated from book sales, seminars and other paid programming that he delivers each year -- and not from the full-time implementation of the trading approaches put forth in this book.  Again, I'm not bashing Mr. Williams but rather am sending up the warning flag to those who read this book.<br />To end this on a positive note, I found Mr. Williams's advice on entry and exit strategy to be useful, especially using a percentage of the current bar's range added to the next bar as a trade entry point following a verified set-up. His thoughts on money management strategy are also sound. Thanks for letting me share my thoughts here and good trading to all!	2002-10-30

At the time, those following the crime believed David Hendricks was guilty, but Vogel's book challenged the thoroughness of the police, questioned their biases and their understanding of religious matters.<br /><br />The story details the events surrounding the murder of three children and their mother, and whether or not the father was guilty. The father, out of town when the police discovered the bodies, claimed an alibi. The police determined, through statements from models he used for his catalog for his company, that perhaps David Hendricks was not faithful to his wife. No affairs were discovered, but the model statements still showed a poor light on Hendrick's commitment to his wife.<br /><br />Hendricks was a lay leader in a relatively small, conservative group of evangelical Christians called the Plymouth Brethren. The police did not realize that this group, though small, shared its basic theology with many Baptist denominations, as well as other better-known Christian groups. Instead, the police surmised that since divorce was discouraged in the Plymouth Brethren, Hendricks felt he needed to kill his family in order to be free of the marriage. Vogel describes the small-town ignorance of the police detectives and prosecutors by using their own trial testimoy. The prosecutor's logical jump was preposterous, but it played heavily into the trial.<br /><br />The town, in a near OJ Simpson trial like frenzy, fed off the news, and the story became both local scandal and national news.<br /><br />Confusing the matter was Hendrick's intense demeanor. He was well-read, and well-thought out, and by no means a man to react over-emotionally. His seemingly calm response, which may have been based on his faith or general personality, caused the police to see Hendricks cynically. Though they weren't country bumpkins, they weren't on the intellectual caliber of Hendricks, a star graduate of Northwestern University and inventor of a top-selling piece of medical equipment.<br /><br />At issue in the trial was if Hendricks had the opportunity to have been at home at the time of the murders. He claimed no, the police claimed yes. The key evidence was the time of death as determined by the digestion of food the children ate. If that could be verified, then the suspect Hendricks was either cleared or very likely the culprit.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" for readers looking to think in this older, yet continually popular true crime book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />americanspeechwriter.comHendricks, a star graduate of Northwestern University and inventor of a top-selling piece of medical equipment.<br /><br />At issue in the trial was if Hendricks had the opportunity to have been at home at the time of the murders.

As such, she had access to papers, people, and places that few individuals have. She presents a view of the early Churchill (age 20-25) that gives one an objective glimpse of his early life, ambitions, and personality. She has done much field research by access to original papers, actual locations, and descendants of those who knew Churchill in his early 20s. Much of her research is centered in South Africa where the young Churchill had a yen for being where the action was in the Boer War, and having an inordinate amount of luck escaping death and danger.  Additionally, she gives detailed maps of his movements, and tries to bridle some of his self-sustaining writings that could not be independently verified. This work should give any reader an understanding that Churchill's early years were a prelude to his more famous leadership role during the dark days of World War II. An excellent read.	2002-10-28

It is the most widely cited of all books on the philosophy of quantum physics, and apart from discussing the issues most effectively, it also could be used as an introduction to graduate-level quantum physics and the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.<br /> With the advent of theories of quantum computation and quantum information theory, the philosophy of quantum mechanics seems to have taken a back seat. The phenomenon of entanglement, considered one of the most exotic of topics in quantum mechanics, is now taken to be one of the cornerstones of quantum information theory and is also considered experimentally verified, despite considerable objections from some &quot;realist&quot; circles. It would seem that philosophical discussion would play a  major role in discussion of quantum information theory, but this has not occured at any substantial level. This may also be a sign of the movement toward viewing science as being in some sense &quot;fundamental&quot;, and not needing philosophical &quot;justification&quot;.<br /> But whatever one's view on these matters is, this book will give a detailed historical overview of the controversy surrounding quantum physics, from a philosophical perspective. It indeed sheds considerable light on the historical context in which quantum mechanics arose, and how its formalism evolved throughout the 20th century. The EPR controversy, the Bohr-Einstein debate, and the rise of many-worlds theories are all fascinating topics, and one can find ample discussion of these by the author. The author is also careful to include a substantial bibliography for serious scholars of quantum physics.	2002-10-26

There are documents and sources still around today that account the events. The Malleus Maleficarnum (Wicth Hammer in Latin), was the absolute Inquisitor's handbook. Through the superstitious ignorance of most people in those days, blaming the Devil and witches on every misfortune, it was not easy for the Pope and the Inquisitors, the most infamous being Tomas De Torquemada, to capture people they believed were witches. Sadly, this was an excuse to erradicate Muslims and Jews who were living in Spain, as well as homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals, Gypsies and anyone considered \\"different\\" from the Church-oriented society. The Malleus is a perfect source of reference for us to learn today that superstition and false accusations SHOULD be verified.

He shows how the US government destroyed the UNs weapons inspection agency Unscom. On 30 October 1998, the UN Security Council, led by the USA, refused to confirm that it would lift sanctions even after Unscom had verified that Iraq had disarmed. This breached Paragraph 22 of its own Resolution 687, and Iraq, temporarily, withdrew its cooperation with Unscom. A month later, it restored cooperation, but the US government had already decided to launch the Desert Fox bombing attack.<br />The US and British governments are covering up the fact that the inspections succeeded. By 1992, Unscom had eliminated Iraqs long-range missile programme. By 1995, the International Atomic Energy Authority had eliminated Iraqs nuclear weapons programme. According to Richard Butler, the head of the Unscom team, Unscom was within a few weeks of completing its work when the US government pulled it out. Why didnt the US government want the inspections to succeed? Because it didnt want Iraq peacefully disarmed, it wanted Iraq defeated in war. Why? Because only by occupying Iraq can the US government get what it really wants - control of Iraqs oil.<br />The Bush government continues vehemently to oppose inspections. The Washington Post noted concern by Wolfowitz and his civilian colleagues in the Pentagon that new inspections could torpedo their plans for military action to remove Hussein from power. As Colin Powell said recently, if UN weapons inspectors returned to Iraq under existing agreements, the US would find ways to thwart that. So Bush is determined to wreck the new agreements achieved on 1 October. He does not want inspections, because they would prevent war; he wants to prevent weapons inspections so that he can launch a war.<br /> Rai puts forward ten reasons for opposing the war: there is no evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction; there is no link between Iraq and 11 September; war would not be about regime change but about dictator change; war could trigger a humanitarian disaster; war would endanger the Kurds; war would be illegal; Iraqs neighbours fear Bush, not Saddam; US and British generals oppose the war; 58% of the British people oppose the war; war could trigger a world recession.<br />One link between Al-Qaida and Iraq that the US government has proposed was an alleged meeting in Prague in April 2001 between Mohamed Atta, the alleged ringleader of the suicide hijackers, and the Iraqi intelligence officer, Ahmad al-Ani. This allegation got worldwide coverage. But, as the BBC reported on 1 May, investigations indicate that at the time of the alleged meeting with the Iraqi agent, Ahmed Chalil Ibrahim Samir Ani, in April 2001, he [Atta] was in Virginia Beach and Florida. Time magazine reported on 13 May, the best hope for Iraqi ties to the attack  a report that lead hijacker Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in the Czech Republic  was discredited last week. Yet Andrew Buncombe of the Independent reported (26 September) that US officials are still using this story to try to prove a link between Iraq and al-Qaida, and he wrongly described the story as disputed, not as refuted.<br />Additionally, the danger of Iraq using any weapons of mass destruction is obviously greatest if it is fighting for its survival. An attack would provoke the actions that it is supposed to prevent!  Iraq has made no threats to use these weapons, but the US, British and Israeli governments have all threatened to use nuclear weapons against Iraq, threats which themselves are breaches of international law.<br />There is no right of pre-emptive self-defence in international law. The Bush-Blair rationale would open the door to any government claiming that it too was justified in attacking any other state that allegedly had any weapons of mass destruction!<br />Bushs threat - which Blair has consistently backed  to attack Iraq even without UN warrant is lynch law. By contrast, the French government has rightly rejected the idea of a war to overthrow Saddam without UN backing. Further, even if the lynch mob bribes the sheriff into signing a warrant, or into looking the other way, it is still lynch law: the Security Council has no authority to tear up the UN Charter, which permits the use of force against a sovereign state only when it is unambiguously self-defence against an armed attack.<br />Stopping Blair from backing Bush would stop Bush.

Usually, it refers to a child that has distinct Negroid features whereas the parents may not appear so.  It can also refer to a child of two distinctly black parents who is born with white features.  The former is usually cause for concern when families are trying to \\"whiten or bleach\\" the line or pass into white society altogether.  This premise is the crux of the storyline of four generations of a family who has been fostered to believe that being white or white in appearance is the saving grace and desire of the black race.<br />Megan, Carrie, Ana, and Mignon, the women whose lives are told, have had their share of trials and tribulations with poverty, men, family, and self-esteem and independence issues. Raised on a Louisiana plantation, Megan is the product of a rape by the landowner, who in turn rapes both Megan and Carrie when they come of age, his own daughter and granddaughter.  If it sounds complicated, convoluted, and complex, it is.  But we find out later in the book the disastrous results of these complexities.  Meanwhile, Carrie suffers isolation and humiliation because she \\"reached back\\" and does not look like the rest of her light, bright, damn near white family.  Her \\"caramel\\" coloring guarantees that she will never be able to have the advantages of white skin or be able to passe blanc.  Some of her siblings do indeed move to New Orleans and cross over into the white world.  Carrie loves her childhood sweetheart, John, who is a dark brown skinned man ,  but marries a fair-skinned man because she believes that is best.  Her life is at first good but a series of circumstances causes her to question her choice and then she encounters John again.  Her daughter Ana \\"suffers\\" the same fate as Carrie and is \\"tan\\" colored, unlike her white- looking siblings.  She, in turn, is mistreated by both her siblings and father, a renowned minister. Ana's beauty and talent cannot be denied however and she becomes a singing sensation in Paris where her sense of worth is elevated, until again, as is the fate of the Devereaux women, she faces heartache.  Back home in Houston, she marries the near white Clark, whose background remains hidden for several years.  Ana's daughter Mignon, in trying to please her now passing for white father, marries a light skinned man.  As she matures and comes into her self-worth, she realizes her former choices and values have been misconstrued.<br />This book was my local book club selection and all kinds of emotions and comments were expressed.

The sources he sights are others who write about the same thing.  Everytime you might think he is going to offer some concrete proof he hides behind the old \\"if I tell you who I am I will die\\" line.  However, I found the chapter on Tesla quite interesting.  And many of his statements in the chapter have been verified.  So, is the entire book true since one chapter seems more verifiable?  This is why I could not give it a one star rating.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered if there is life after death. Now, I'm going to make several comments:<BR>I've noticed in several reviews that many readers are not content with the scientific methods that Dr Gary E. R. Schwartz uses to coduct the afterlife experiments. In part I agree with the reviewers because I noticed it myself. However, the issue is that there is no real scientific principle (known scientific principle) that can be used to verify these claims. In a physics experiment, there are certain tanglible variables, there is observation, recording the results, analyzing the data, and providing a theory that agrees with observation and the data results. The same goes for other kinds of experiments such as Chemistry, Geology, etc. Now, how do you carry out an experiment for which there are no guidelines, no tangible variables? I think Dr Schwartz did pretty well, given the circumstances. <BR>Will this book convince you that there is life after death? No, I don't think so. I don't think any book can do that. But the book does present \\"evidence\\" that could be termed as compelling. <BR>I am a scientist myself, a physicist. It is not easy to convince me of things that cannot be verified through any accepted scientific method. Also, it is important to point out that the scientific method has been developed based on tangible and observable phenomena, not this. What I mean to say is that we cannot judge Dr Schwartz's scientific method by any other standards because there aren't any. So I think we should give Dr Schwartz a break on this specific issue.<BR>Besides that, the book is well written and documented. Dr Schwartzs definitely has a case and his research is genuine. <BR>I have read many books about the afterlife that attribute these amazing experiences to the human brain. In these other books, the authors claim that these experiences have something to do with brain processes. I think that if this book by DrGary E. R. Schwartz really proves anything, given the legitimate experiments, is the fact that the afterlife experiences are not the consequence of some unknown brain process, but of some other aspect of reality that we do not yet understand.	2002-10-18

In a flush of serendipity, I started finding references to Dr. Pinker and his works elsewhere; turns out he is considered one of the pivotal figures of modern evolutionary psychology and an archenemy of New Age, feminist and other postmodern, erm, thinkers. That alone could have driven me to his works; but I stumbled upon this book by pure chance, and I am very glad I did.<br />&quot;Words and rules&quot;, as its title suggests, is a less ambitious and more technical book than &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; or &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;. It is likely to produce less controversy. It is less than friendly for readers without background in linguistics. There are very few far-reaching conjectures - most of the stories Pinker recounts are solid, scientifically verified data.<br />However, the consequences which follow are disturbing and unusual. The seemingly trivial question of regular and irregular words in languages, and English irregular verbs in particular, has major repercussions for this other question Dr. Pinker had tackled earlier - how the mind works.<br />To try to sum it up: in language acquisition and language use, humans employ two systems: memory and structure, lexicon and grammar, words and rules. They are interdependent, but distinctly separate. Their separation in human minds is illustrated by numerous examples from children's speech mistakes, speech impediments in people with various brain injuries, and neurological data, obtained by more or less direct observation of brain activity. All languages depend heavily on words; you cannot use even Esperanto unless you have mastered its basic vocabulary. As for rules, their participation in speech differs from language to language, but there is no language which does not use rules at all. People resort to rules whenever there is a failure of access to memory. For example, if you encounter a nonsense verb - &quot;to squink&quot; - you are much more likely to form its past tense as &quot;squinked&quot;, not &quot;squank&quot;, because you do not have any &quot;squank&quot; in your memory bank, and the regular &quot;-ed&quot; suffix jumps into play immediately. Pinker convincingly shows in one of the most amazing chapters of his book, that regularity does not necessarily mean statistical prevalence; true, there are many more regular verbs in English than irregulars; but in German, for example, the default plural of nouns is formed by the *least* frequent suffix, which just happens to be regular and therefore resides in the &quot;rules&quot; domain rather than in &quot;words&quot;.<br />No specific language is innate; no serious scholar would dispute it. Whether there are any linguistic universalia, is, as far as I understand, still debatable. Pinker's approach is, however, one step higher; it deals with the language instinct, with the innate ability to implement communication through language - and the tools which organize it into a system. It is probably more complex than the dualism of words and rules; but as a first approximation, as a working model it seems to be the step in the right - and necessary - direction.<br />Why necessary? Because, as Pinker argues, now is the first time in history when we can start bridging the gap between humanities and science. Because the academic research in history, languages and literature can finally justify itself by coming closer to its ultimate, though probably misunderstood in the past, goal - to know how the mind works. That is what humanities are about; that is where they can join efforts with science to come closer to that goal.<br />For me that was the central message of the book (spelled - or spelt? - out by the author in the final chapter). Jokes, cartoons and extracts from the writings of &quot;language mavens&quot; are never out of place, always to the point; and the jocular plurals of &quot;harmonicae, fives and dra&quot; left me breathless with laughter. This is a scholarly book, not light reading; and if you treat it as such, you'd see it for the marvellous achievement it is.	2002-10-10

Was man actually around with the dinosours?  If not, why are their paintings of such found in caves?  Could earth actually be a giant prison colony?  Were humans genetically engineered as a \\"worker\\" race for extra terrestrials?  Has there actually been more than one species of human beings on earth?  Although this book offers a lot of ideas that should warrant thought it offers little proof behind them.  But ideas should always be considered.  Most statements that are offered as fact can not be followed up and verified easily.  The authors offer no dates, towns, or books of reference on many of the things they present.  But again, give them fair contemplation.<br />What of the Apkallu?  or Oannes?  Teachers of the ancient mesopotamian civilization, who were they, where did they come from?  Were there prehistoric nuclear blasts?  Some evidence is offered, or deduced is a better word. <br />Were Eisenhour & Churchill worried about an alien invasion of earth?  Are alien races at conflict over the control of the future of earth?  Are aliens demonic in nature?  Will calling for the help of Jesus thwart an alien abduction?  Are we experiencing the battle of good and evil?  Demons and angels battling for our soul?  The list of ideas in this book range far and wide.  <br />Could alien sightings be caused by electromagnetic field variations and their perceptions by the temporal lobes of the human brain?  Are their alien bases on the moon?  How do some major religions compare in their beliefs of the end times?  See many, many faulty predictions.  And the age old question of what is time?<br />This book is very interesting but I don't feel really \\"teaches\\" you much.  But it is thought provoking and it does force you to \\"think\\".  It encourages you to contemplate the possibilities of what is being presented.  You should read this book among many other books on the subject/subjects presented.  This book can be a good starting place for many paranormal thoughts and ideas of the unexplained that we face today.  The more we know, the less we understand.  This book address's what we think we may know and what we probably don't understand.	2002-10-05

He has created the art-loving detective, Owen McKenna, in his action-packed series beginning with Tahoe Death FALL, which was published in 2001. He quickly followed his maiden book with Tahoe Blowup. Thriller Press launched its business with Todd's Tahoe Death Fall, which was an astute decision.<br />Fourteen-year-old Jennifer Salazar, a wealthy young heiress, shows up at Owen McKenna's office to hire him as a private investigator because she feels the death of her twin sister nine years before is no accident. She has the I.Q. of a genius, is set to inherit almost four hundred million dollars, and is rightly convinced someone is out to kill her. McKenna, his Harlequin Dane named Spot, and his girlfriend, an exotic beauty who is an entomologist named Street, believe Jennifer. Her claim is verified everywhere they turn as dead bodies from the past and present speak of a family full of evil secrets and unsuspecting victims:<br /> \\"'That's what they say,' Immanuel said.<br /> 'What do you mean?'<br /> 'Just what I said. That's what they say.'<br /> 'You don't believe it?'<br /> 'Put it this way,' the old man said wearily. He leaned his head back and rested it<br /> against the pillow. 'There is something wrong with the woman. She is disturbed.<br /> No doubt about it. But a paranoid schizophrenic needing to be locked up? I doubt it.'\\"<br />Todd Borg writes a rip-roaring, suspense-driven mystery that keeps the reader glued to his book until the final breathtaking denouement. His characters are superbly crafted, especially his dog Spot, who looms over the action like a benevolent giant, finally risking his life when necessary. Borg knows how to spin a yarn, and he is adept at utilizing every nook and cranny of the Lake Tahoe area as his backdrop. Tahoe Death Fall is an outstanding effort from a true up-and-comer in the mystery business. Borg is able to send shivers up our spine and make us think twice about checking all the doors and windows before we go to bed at night, as well as looking for skeletons in our ancestry.

I am drawn to typography and graphic design and this book looks well-designed so I bought it. I even enjoy the foldouts.<br />But, of course, as expected the novelty of the design wore out and I decided to read it - after all, isn't that exactly what we do with books? Read them?<br />First chapter I am already trying to control my gag response. Two chapters more and my suspicion is verified - this is a terribly written book. Terrible in the sense that it is so self-indulgent. The fantastic element starts becoming so contrived and has called attention to itself. In time, the plot wobbles shamelessly. All the author's efforts in trying to prevent the story from coming out wickedly boring and the sentences from sounding badly written fail not with a bang but a whimper. Her sentences could no longer afford to support its own ponderous weight. The center wouldn't hold. The maelstrom of mediocre writing is collapsing upon itself until you wish to drink hemlock or smoke some weed to alleviate your suffering.<br />There is too much suffering in the world already and I will not take it from a failed novelist whose main claim to fame is her talent for parading her impoverished imagination and a talent for expressing it so that you are put to sleep.<br />Enough. Now to get my money's worth I have started cutting up the foldouts from the book and make a decoupage out of them.	2002-10-04

US	51343799	R33RII8BWTXLNJ	0618091572	131712297	Mapping Human History: Discovering the Past Through Our Genes	Books	4	8	20	N	N	Genes and Genealogy -- The Whole Human Race	This is a delightful history of the migration of the whole human race based on what we now can read through DNA information - fortunately a great deal more than we have ever known before, and unfortunately still limited by the infantile state (compared to what it will become) of genetic knowledge.  We can only trace migration through mitochondrial DNA, passed woman-to-woman, and Y chromosomes, passed man-to-man.  Thus we are talking about the DNA of your mother's mother's mother's mother ... back to a particular change (mutation) and of your father's father's father's father ...  This would not be enough to tell an individual much about the history of his or her own ancestors (unless you still archaically think that only a paternal-paternal lineage is \\"really\\" ancestral), but it is just barely enough to give an interesting overview of the mass migrations of peoples around the globe, and, more importantly, to demonstrate incontrovertibly that we are, indeed, only one \\"race\\" - that of humans.  Ethnicities vary by gradations around the world, starting from a single source in Africa, and there are no definitively separate races.<br />For me this story is fascinating because I have sought, just for my own enlightenment, other ways to trace the history of peoples before genetic research made even this preliminary sweep of information available to us, and the findings confirm those speculative ventures.  My first efforts were through population mapping, and then, more successfully, through genealogical research.  <br />At first, I started collecting atlases of population history, and mapping the clusters of human habitation at each historical point.  These were only reasonably accurate for relatively recent times, however, and still left the connections between civilizations completely unexplained.<br />The other approach I took was even more fascinating and, surprisingly, many of the conclusions I drew, unscientifically, from genealogical research, are validated specifically by Olson in this book.  I started off as an amateur genealogist (and still am decidedly amateur), but was daunted by the fact that one either runs into dead ends that one can't jump over (which is the case for most seeking ancestral data), or the multiplier effect of doubling the number of ancestors with each generation makes the information simply too extensive to catalogue.  I soon found I was blessed and cursed with the latter problem - having fortuitously hit upon a royal ancestry and aristocratic lineages, where records were carefully kept in order to maintain inheritance rights, I soon found I couldn't handle all the files, and the information literally never, ever, ends.  <br />When computer genealogy and resources on the internet became available in the mid 1990's, I jumped back in, and were my eyes opened!  Thinking my heritage to be British (mostly Scottish and English), it wasn't long until I was able to plug in ancestors from every single country of Europe, with, I think, not a single exception -- and even a little beyond (for example, Middle Eastern connections through Moors and Jews in Spain, and other links back as far as Middle Kingdom Egypt - don't ask!).  At first, I thought this was simply because aristocratic families intermarried with aristocrats from neighboring countries, but I soon concluded, with Olson, that the fact that I found myself descended from Charlemagne was not a fluke or something to brag about - it must be that almost all Europeans are descended from him - it's just that most don't have the records.  I don't claim that all of the records I have found can be verified (although for fun I did retain professionals to verify the royal lineage) -- much is based on unverifiable family lore and certainly people have intentionally falsified records with a strong incentive to do so when an inheritance is at stake.  But rather than seeing the linkages as \\"my\\" ancestry, which some of it may not be, it has given me a vibrant picture of atleast the entire continent of Europe as not split up into discrete ethnic units, but wildly overlapping generation after generation.  Now that I have plugged in all the collateral lineages of recent years - intermarriages of cousins, siblings, etc. - my database of persons related to me by \\"blood\\" or marriage includes also people whose ancestors were from Asia, Africa, and most of the world. <br />Olson says the entire population of the world is likely descended from Nefertiti - -- I checked.    Yes!  My database says she was my 114th great-grandmother.  Now I know that while there is a high probability that the actual lineage in my database is erroneous, nonetheless she is indeed one of my (and your!) fabulous female forebears.	2002-09-28

However, it needed a careful editing before printing. The diagram on page 33 was not labeled. The answer on page 51 is wrong.  The answer on page 55 contains an answer (t=533) that not only is wrong, but should have rung a bell with the authors when they got it. (The correct answer is 53.3, which can easily be verified.) This proves that using a hand calculator without thinking about what size the answer ought to be leads to embarassing errors.

Without having verified all of Byron's sources myself, I have to say this book provides a convincing depiction of someone who will do anything for personal gain. Nothing or no one is sacred.

The black and white photos are disapointing, being colour originals not well reproduced in grey scale. At best, this book is less useful than talking to a local resident or outfitter.

Despite having read and been impressed by other Wallerstein books, I was almost discouraged by some of the reviews that appeared here, talking about how \\"dry\\" this book is and how it is overfull of quotations and such.  Ridiculous.  I checked it out of a nearby research library and was quickly impressed enough to order a copy for myself at $60!  The quotations are fascinating and readers should be impressed by the massive amount of material that Wallerstein has reviewed.  Readers seeking an introductory work should look elsewhere.  This is the first volume in a series of highly groundbreaking contributions to macrosociology.  I personally find it much more illuminating that Wallerstein uses extensive footnoting (where most of the quotations appear) and would much rather read full quotations in these notes than simply see references to hundreds of works that I probably won't have the time and resources to locate anyway.  That way, readers can appreciate what they're supposed to from the cited sources rather than just take for granted that they fit in, or have to research them on their own.  The book makes valuable points with good regularity and fits them together into what would then be recognized in the field as World Systems Theory.  Once I have finished it entirely, I may want to shift my rating.  For now, the theoretical significance of this book (whose qualities are verified by my readings so far) definitely makes it essential reading for grad students or professionals in macrosociology.  Introductory readers should probably start with introductory chapters (in theory and global inequalities) from a basic Sociology textbook and then read Wallerstein's more concise statement \\"Historical Capitalism\\" before proceeding on to this detailed series of books.	2002-09-18

Although written for entertainment, and written very well, the story also included some incredibly accurate prognosticatons about how the terrorist's fixation on killing westerners leads them inevitably to act out their diabolical plans. Everything our leaders needed in the way of a wake-up call was in this book, including what now seems in retrospect, an eminently practical method of exterminating the fanatic organizers and directors of such horrible events. I applaud Carpenter for his insight and expertise, the flashes of brilliance in his writing, but commiserate with him that apparently the message did not get through in time, despite being couched within an extraordinarily imaginative adventure plot that should have enticed every lover of action-oriented fiction to read it. I found it by inserting a keyword search for books on terrorism and among all the dry semi-documentary non-fiction treatises, found this extremely satisfying jewel. One day Osama's fate may be finally verified and it will be interesting to see how closely it parallels the epilogue of Arabian Assignment.	2002-09-12

But it would be nice to have seen some correlation coefficients when he talked of this and that as being correlated. There are also more detailed things that I might like to have known/ seen verified in the discussions of black income, such as differing average ages and an adjustment for the fact that 56% of blacks live in the South, where there is a significant income differential.<br />Kudos to him for his description of differences in BEHAVIOR as accounting for differnces in output. Thomas Sowell has written on this point exhaustively, especially in his \\"Race and Culture\\" trilogy, but he deliberately used other examples to show that in different places, similar mentalities will lead to similar results. Really, very little that has been shown here (in the way of data) is different to what has been shown before. It's just that the writing in this piece makes for lighter reading--at the sacrifice of some details.<br />With this qualification, I will rate the book 5 stars not because of its analysis, but because of its willingness to confront some of the garbage that one hears in black studies departments across the country and some of the lines of reasoning/ refrains that one hears from black students that are so identical as to make one believe that Black Studies departments are second only to the Chinese government in terms of propaganda.<br />One thing that might have helped the book would have been the theme: \\"I see this trend, here is Citation X in support of that.\\" On the one hand, he did better than do most people who write about this by giving specific examples of what he was talking about (especially the study patterns of black students), but on the other, it is sometimes very hard to believe everything that people claim to have witnessed, no matter how smart they are.  It is for this reason that I am partial to authors who use examples that are at least confirmed by a third party.<br />Kudos again to him for showing some of the distorted thinking processes that go into perpetuating things such as Afrocentric interpretations of history.

I haven't verified this, but I believe Dr Johnson's comment on reading Paradise Lost was something like 'This is not even English'. I do recall T S Eliot's two famous onslaughts on him for much the same reason, and Eliot's description of the Miltonic idiom as 'a lingo of his own based on English', which I would call exactly right, only I don't see that as a criticism. To me Milton is a drug. I love sound, I love language and I know Latin poetry (Greek as well, but that is more important for the mythology than the poetry). I also know my bible pretty well, as atheists often do. For me, Paradise Lost is about two things -- first to justify the ways of God to men, and second that incredible lingo. I'm not sure how anyone who does not have a good knowledge of Latin, its poetry in particular, can really appreciate Milton's idiom. Eliot makes a song and dance over certain of its features, one I remember from Samson being about the moon<br />'Hid in her vacant interlunar cave', about which Eliot acutely observes that the word 'interlunar' is not necessary to the sense. Sure it's not. Offhand from Paradise Lost I could quote<br />'Of light the greater part by far he took<br />Transplanted from her cloudy shrine', where you can say the same about 'transplanted', and there are hundreds of such instances. This is a very characteristic way that Latin poetry in general expressed itself, and Eliot has got the wrong end of the stick by not understanding that. Much of Milton's vocabulary is also half-Latin, e.g. 'complicated' meaning knotted and countless other such. I can never unknow my Latin, thank God, and so I can never be sure just what Milton' poetry, as opposed to his theology, conveys to those who read him without it.<br />When I had Milton forced down my throat, my unhearing ears (maybe even my 'blind mouth') at school (I did not pursue English further but went for Greek and Latin), the orthodox view appeared to be that Satan was some great piece of 'characterisation'. To this day that interpretation means nothing to me. Milton is all about sound and language, not characters. God, Satan (Ariel does not get anything to say), Adam, Eve, Ithuriel and the whole mighty harlequinade are all just talking the great Miltonic talk, like the author himself between the speeches. The thought creates the tone of the talk, and the tone creates the characters. In the early books Satan is the focus, in the later Adam and Eve. They sound different because they think differently. This is not drama or anything resembling drama.<br />Milton justifies the ways of God to me very well. I was brought up religious and I am at home with theological argument. Milton's argument is strong given his base position as an intense believer, and it is what underpins the terrific strength and the unremitting concentration of his whole apocalyptic vision. To me God is just a hypothesis and that is as far as I can go with him, and to me poetry is far more significant than theology. I have read a load of pretentious hot air about what poetry is, but the remark that illuminated the issue to me more than all the rest of it was by Housman in an address on Swinburne, when he said 'poetry is a tone of voice, a way of saying things'. Bingo. Spot on. Paradise Lost to me is all one mighty voice talking 'in divers tones' as Tennyson has it.<br />On a lighter note, did you know that the word 'backside' is used in Paradise Lost? You will find it at III/494 as part of his attack on Catholicism. This is a particularly memorable passage, and I say that not as an atheist but as someone who appreciates humour. My memory of Milton outside of Paradise Lost is lengthening, though I plan to refresh it, but at the moment it is the only instance of anything that could even possibly be seen as humour in Milton. I choose to forget everything I have seen described as 'humour' in Comus.odox view appeared to be that Satan was some great piece of 'characterisation'. To this day that interpretation means nothing to me. Milton is all about sound and language, not characters. God, Satan (Ariel does not get anything to say), Adam, Eve, Ithuriel and the whole mighty harlequinade are all just talking the great Miltonic talk, like the author himself between the speeches.

I have read a load of pretentious hot air about what poetry is, but the remark that illuminated the issue to me more than all the rest of it was by Housman in an address on Swinburne, when he said 'poetry is a tone of voice, a way of saying things'. Bingo. Spot on. Paradise Lost to me is all one mighty voice talking 'in divers tones' as Tennyson has it.<br />On a lighter note, did you know that the word 'backside' is used in Paradise Lost? You will find it at III/494 as part of his attack on Catholicism. This is a particularly memorable passage, and I say that not as an atheist but as someone who appreciates humour. My memory of Milton outside of Paradise Lost is lengthening, though I plan to refresh it, but at the moment it is the only instance of anything that could even possibly be seen as humour in Milton. I choose to forget everything I have seen described as 'humour' in Comus.	2002-09-07

If you've looked through the customer reviews to help you decide on buying this book like I did, then you've noticed how there's no middle ground there. People either loved it, or hated it. So, I decided to wait until I knew more about it. I then learned a friend of mine owned a copy, and I asked of her thoughts. She offered to send it to me, which she did. <br />About 1/3 of the way through it, I had to start flipping back through the pages I'd already read to make sure I didn't misunderstand some things. Further into it, I realized I was getting lost, but not the way one typically loses one's self in a book. The author has a tendency to drift off course, which he does several times in the middle of telling his story, or making a point. Speaking of which, the story itself plays out more like a bizarre dream, rather than a series of non-fictional events. The author describes several events, and even quotes dialog, that would have been impossible for anyone to have known since the persons involved were killed before describing any of it to anyone else. He claims to have documents which verify the detailed events he describes, but neglects to show them anywhere in the book (with the exception of the endnotes list in the back). In addition, there were particular events described which just wouldn't have been possible to document at all, at least not as far as I could imagine.<br />Furthermore, there was a familiarity about this book, but it wasn't in the story itself. The DeFeo murders was a very well publicized case, and there really wasn't too much left to be discovered since it happened some 28-years ago. Yet this book tells a radically different version that keeps falling apart, as it is being pieced together. There were many unnecessary bits of information that seemed to be included, solely on the basis of making it all appear more credible as a whole. It would have made for a far more interesting read (and certainly more credible) if the supporting evidence was shown instead. The familiarity of it came across in the overall tone of the author himself. It was almost the exact same tone of the book written by Dr. Stephen Kaplan, where he attempts expose the Lutz family as willing participants of a hoax. In both cases, there are hints of resentment which leave an impression as being the fuel of the author's motivation. Unfortunately, it also creates a cloud of suspicion which overshadows an already incredulous depiction of events.<br />This book was largely based on the word of a woman claiming to have been married to Ronald DeFeo at the time of the murders, but the explanations given as to why she played no part in the initial investigation, or the subsequent murder trial are more humorous, than anything else. The author is insistent that he's verified this, and stresses her authenticity. However, the one simply undeniable submission of proof (a certificate of marriage) is again, nowhere to be found. For the lack of this one piece of evidence, is where this entire story takes a nose dive. The first book written about the DeFeo murders titled \\"High Hopes\\" (which this book attempts to discredit) was by far more fascinating and well written than this book could hope to be. It's author, Gerard Sullivan, was the prosecuting attorney at DeFeo's murder trial, who wrote the book from the testimonial transcripts. I bought that book almost twenty years ago, and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. If you're interested in reading about the Amityville murders, then that would be the book to read. ...	2002-09-06
US	49341609	RL3R37ULEHA7P	0375726217	509246269	Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper	Books	4	16	19	N	N	An enraging book	I worked at the San Francisco Public Library for eight years (1985 to 1992), and I can cheerfully report that librarians are as subject to human frailties as the rest of us.  Professional arrogance and jealous guarding of position at the expense of purpose are not universal, but nor are they unheard  of.  If librarians are any less susceptible, as a class, to the lemming  enthusiasms that beset lesser mortals, no one told my colleagues about it.<br />When I read this book, what outraged me was not that every library in the country didn't keep every copy of every newspaper it ever received.  What outraged me  was that virtually no library-not even the Library of Congress-kept complete runs of the most important newspapers of the 19th and  20th centuries.  This seems to me an inexcusable refusal of a professional obligation.  If the Library of Congress cannot or will not keep at least ONE intact set of these important primary records, it fails in the most basic task it has been set.  If a master's degree in library science allows a person to feel otherwise, then possessing one should automatically disqualify people from being hired as librarians. <br />Librarians are civil servants, a designation which implies some responsibility to the public and  to posterity.  To believe that what concerns us today, as a  society, is what will concern societies of tomorrow-and that the librarian's job thus requires judicious winnowing of primary materials that \\"don't circulate\\"-is a bureaucratic vulgarism based on a fantastic failure of the imagination.<br />As a lover of \\"artifacts,\\" Nicholson Baker argues that the newspapers that were thrown out  and replaced with the sporadic, distorted fossil record that is microfilm should have been saved; this seems to be what irritates librarians most about his book. However, he argues more persuasively that one complete run should have been saved somewhere, if only to await a technology that could reproduce their colors and images properly.It's hard to imagine anyone disagreeing with this. Unfortunately, a premature enthusiam for microfilming and discarding newspapers made this impossible.<br />Is this book shrill and emotionally overwrought?  If its claims are true, it has every right to be.<br />Well then: were original newspapers destroyed after being microfilmed? Yes.  Does the microfilm record contain considerable gaps?  Yes. Does it preserve the outstanding graphic work of the important American artists and photographers who worked for the dailies in the early 20th century? No.  Is it thus a usuable resource for students of printing, photography, graphic design, or cartoon art? No.  Are some pages unreadable because the edges have been cut off by sloppy technicians? Yes.  Did some microfilm deteriorate more rapidly, and with greater loss of legibility, than the original newspaper would have? Yes. Vartan Gregorian claimed that seventy percent of the books printed after 1850 would deteriorate so badly as to be unusable by the year 2000-is this figure correct? Not by any stretch of the imagination.<br />None of this is simply my opinion, or Mr. Baker's.  These are facts that can be verified by going into any library in America. The inference seems clear.<br />At the SFPL, certain departments were famous for being thoroughly self-referential and hermetic; concerns about public service were not allowed to interfere with scheming, empire-building, and tireless jockeying for position.  Even so, when Ken Dowlin took over the library, and we were all invited to hear his inaugural address, many librarians were visibly upset to hear him say that  he wanted to get replace books with electronic files (although they seemed far more shocked by his admission that he kept a Bible by his bed).  Despite these grumblings, Dowlin's regime sent to the landfill books of such staggering value that they could have provided at least a year's operating budget for one or two of the smaller branches (certain of which wereonly open one or two days a week due to financial constraints).<br />All of this is a matter of public record; if the professionals to whom we've entrusted our libraries cannot see the wastefulness and illogic of their actions, I would suggest that their minds are clouded by considerations that are inimical to their responsibilities as public servants.	2002-09-05
US	51147790	R1ZD1LH4CVAWZD	0793153891	421366668	Getting to 'Closed': A Proven Program to Accelerate the Sales Cycle and Increase Commissions	Books	5	11	11	N	N	How to Reduce the Sales Cycle	There are several excellent books on sales and sales training. This is one of the best. It offers what I consider to be a uniquely comprehensive, cohesive, and time-effective system which Schiffman calls a \\"Prospect Management\\" program.  Apparently this system have been adopted, in some instances modified, and then implemented by more than 1,800 different organizations. I agree with Schiffman that the word \\"organizations\\" is more appropriate than \\"companies\\" because colleges,  universities, and churches as well as other non-profits must also generate substantial revenue from their respective constituencies. If anything, their need to manage their \\"prospects\\" effectively is even greater than is the need of for-profits. Benefactors, for example, must be convinced to sustain (if not increase) their financial support; volunteers must be enlisted; and staff members must \\"buy into\\" necessary changes in policy and procedure. All organizations (regardless of size or nature) will derive substantial benefit from the wealth of information and insights which he shares in this book.<br />Schiffman carefully organizes his material within three separate but interrelated Parts: The Fundamentals, Learning the System, and Getting Up and Running. The foundation of the \\"Prospect Management\\" program consists of complete and current information about prospects which is prioritized and then classified within four active stages of the sales cycle. First,  decision-makers who have agreed to a preliminary meeting; next, decision-makers who then specifically indicate interest and agree to discuss budgets and pricing; next, decision-makers who have made at least a verbal agreement; and finally, decision-makers who have become customers, (i.e. signed a contract). Schiffman also has another category, \\"Fallbacks/opportunities\\": assumed but unverified decision-makers with whom initial contact has been made but who are not as yet prospects. \\"These are candidates, suspects, leads or referrals -- people [you] want to do business with, but with whom [you] do not yet have a real relationship.\\" Because change is the only constant in today's business world, Schiffman correctly emphasizes the importance of constantly updating the prospect database. Hence the need for constantly obtaining new information. Subjected to rigorous evaluation, the information is  converted it into intelligence data which guide and inform the \\"Prospect Management\\" program.<br />As Schiffman would be the first to point out, the \\"Prospect Management\\" program as he presents it may not be wholly appropriate in all respects to a given sales organization. That is to say, decision-makers must be prepared to make whatever modifications may be necessary. For example, consider how varied sales cycles are (e.g. those for a Boeing 777, an SUV, a  major appliance, an insurance policy, or a pair of sneakers); also, the differences between and among so-called \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" salespersons; also,  the number of decision-makers and decision-influencers involved. Nonetheless, the basic principles of Schiffman's \\"Prospect Management\\" program remain valid no matter who is selling what to whom.<br />Some of the best material is provided within five appendices but I strongly recommend that they be read only after reading the 20 chapters which precede them. Schiffman introduces and then explains his system step-by-step. There is a continuity to his thinking which is reflected in the sequence of the material provided. With great care, he \\"walks\\" his reader through that material. Also, at the end of  the first 18 chapters, he includes a \\"Quick Quiz\\" for the reader. (The correct answers can be found after the final chapter.) If at times the narrative seems redundant (and it does), that is because there are several key points worthy of being reiterated. The accumulative impact ensures that those key points will be retained in the reader's mind long after the book has been read.<br />Obviously, I think highly of this book. However, given the importance of maximizing sales and (yes) commissions, I think salespersons and especially those who supervise them should consult several different sources of information and counsel. Therefore, I also highly recommend Rackham's SPIN Selling, Boylan's The Power to Get In, and Werth's High Probability Selling. Each of these also offers much of value. However, I again stress the importance of formulating, implementing, and then constantly fine-tuning a cohesive, comprehensive, and time-effective sales program. For that reason, I'd start with the \\"Prospect Management\\" program and modify accordingly.ly of this book.

I tell you this, even though it must be obvious to you considering where these words are appearing. I love technology, but I'm not blind to its problems. To those who say technology has no faults, I ask you when was the last time your computer crashed or whatever happened to that grand notion of a &quot;paperless office&quot;? Technology is something between Pandora's box and Prometheus' gift; I would not want to live without it because I've read history, but I can also imagine an even better world.<br />Neil Postman may or may not love technology, but he certainly knows its failings. Postman is the author of several books on the interplay between American culture and technology, and his most recent, Technopoly, is in some ways a culmination of his previous efforts. Postman is an educator who is distressed by the state of American education. Instead of simply decrying the fact that schools are changing and moaning for a return to the &quot;good ol' days,&quot; Postman took the time to understand the nature of the beast, dissect it, and present his conservation strategy. As he states, his idea of getting &quot;back to the basics&quot; is not quite the same as that typically bandied about by politicians and policy makers.<br />First, the argument. Postman describes what he calls the three stages of how a culture deals with technology: 1) tool-using, 2) technocracy, 3) technopoly. In a tool-using culture, technical improvements are limited to the uses at hand. This differs from the technocracy, where the tools &quot;play a central role in the thought world of the culture.&quot; In the technopoly, tools become the culture. Astute readers may sense a possible linkage here with Alvin Toffler's three waves of culture detailed in The Third Wave. Toffler views each wave as having a trough and crest, with monumental social impact happening as each wave breaks upon the shore of human culture. Toffler says the reason for the breakdown in our traditional structures today is that we are in the break between the second and third wave. Toffler predicts a time of stability in the future, in which this new wave of culture and technology will have enhanced all of our lives. Postman and Toffler are not exactly foes in their views of the waves of culture, but differ on how we are to approach this change. Toffler implies that it will sort itself out -- a type of laissez-faire view of societal change that makes it easier to understand Toffler's ties to Newt Gingrich. Postman feels we must address the change, or it will destroy us.<br />To that end, Postman writes a history of the growth of technology in American society. His history centers on the impact of technology on the medical profession -- how it saw the progression of each technological stage to the detriment of both doctors and patients. As damning as this evaluation is, he follows it with an even better one from our standpoint: the impact of computers on American culture. As I said before, I love technology, and computer technology most of all, but it was impossible not to follow Postman's clear and reasoned analysis of the computer's impact on society.<br />Had Postman ended here, having formulated his theory and verified it with examples, the book would have been simply interesting, but Postman follows it with a suggested course of action. It is unsurprising that, as an educator, his solutions center on this area of society, but he states that his suggestions could never be implemented without being supported in the political and legal arenas, to name two. Postman proposes a goal for American education -- no longer, he says, can we simply train people for employment (the current state of education), but we must instill in people a purpose. His proposed goal is the betterment of humanity. To achieve this goal, he suggests that we get back to the basics in our schools, but by this he means the study of the underlying assumptions of our culture rather than just basic skills. That is, he posits a curriculum that includes the history of every subject as part of that subject, including the history (or ideology) of history itself. Only by understanding how we came to be in the place we stand now, will we be able to move forward.<br />Only a few days before I finished reading Technopoly, Microsoft and MCI announced an initiative to get every public school a presence on the Internet. While it is a generous offer, we should examine the purpose of it all. How exactly will this aid our educational goals? I love technology and I'm bullish on the prospect of the interactive properties of the Internet to help bring about a new form of thinking, critical Americans (especially as opposed to the last mass media technology that came about, television), but that does not mean that the implementation of the technology does not need to be evaluated. And this, in a nutshell, is what Postman is about. I've probably done a major disservice to Postman in summarizing so much of his treatise here, but I hope that it has been sufficiently intriguing that it actually got you to thinking. I suggest as a follow-up that you try the text itself or some of the works listed in the bibliography. It is what I'll be doing.ls.

US	51979496	R10LBMEQSMB8KS	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	1	0	0	N	N	Waving the White Flag	Like most of the other reviewers here, I used to be a big Clancy fan.  As usual, I bought this book the day it came out and hoped that the last novel (The Bear and the Dragon) was an aberration.  Wrong!  This book proves (at least to me) that Tom Clancy's interest isn't in writing good books anymore, but rather collecting his royalty checks.  He's given up.  Put a fork in him.<br />Believe the reviewers here who say that nothing happens in this book-- it's true.  This is a 100 page novel stretched into 600+.  Even as a 100 page novel, it wouldn't be very good.  The plot is simple-- The Soviets want to kill the Pope; a Russian defects and tells the Americans/British; Jack Ryan tries to prevent the assassination, but fails.  <br />While the defection had possibilities of being exiting (remember The Cardinal of the Kremlin?), Clancy makes it boring (get in the back of a truck, drive accross the border and board an airplane for London).  As for the assassination attempt, let's just say that for drama, it's no Day of the Jackel.<br />But no one pays $$$ for 100 page novels (especially those with Clancy's name on the cover).  So Clancy needed to provide the fill.  A typical chapter is as follows:  Person wakes up.  Person eats breakfast.  Person goes to work on a train/subway.  Person has deep philosophical thoughts.  Person goes home.  Person talks with wife.  Person goes to bed.  Next chapter, same thing, but with a different person (although for some reason, the deep philosophical thoughts remain the same).  This goes on and on and on WITHOUT ANYTHING HAPPENING!<br />In addition, for a guy who supposively is into detail, Clancy drops the ball here as well.  The novel takes place in 1981 (easily verified because that's when the Pope was actually shot), but Clancy has Ryan bragging about the Starbucks IPO (which didn't take place until 1992).  The Foley's (who I found kind of dull) apparently got out of Iran just before the embassy was taken over in November 1979 becausethey were about to have a baby.  In Red Rabbit, the baby should be about 18 months old, but instead is 4 and is constantly watching the Transformers, a cartoon show that didn't debute until September 1984.  Clancy has Baltimore and Philadelphia playing in the World Series (it was actually the Dodgers and the Yankees in 1981; Baltimore and Philadelphia played each other in 1983).  Adm. Greer keeps talking about the Orioles' rookie shortstop being something special.  (Well, I guess you could call Cal Ripken's .128 batting average (over 39 at-bats) in 1981 special.)  All of this stuff was easy to figure out, which begs the question-- if Tom's not trying, why should we?<br />Please save your money and your time-- they are better used elsewhere, I promise.	2002-09-03

Authors A. Larry Elliott and Richard J. Schroth have written a pithy book that does not tell us much about the collapse of Enron that we didn't already know. Yet the book does us a service by standing firm in its conviction that this seemingly endless rash of corporate greed and stupidity at the highest levels is inexcusable and requires major structural changes in the business of business.<br />Elliott and Schroth are consultants who are intimately familiar with the world of Fortune 500 companies. They believe that a new management science, one not taught at business schools, arose over the past decade as a result of the booming economy: \\"managed mendacity.\\" The authors explain their term: \\"Lies and deception help the inner circle achieve personal goals of greed and cover up their incompetence as executives.\\" And they argue that managed mendacity can be found in virtually every industry and every business. \\"The same processes are in play whether books are being cooked, tobacco executives are testifying that nicotine is not addictive, airlines are telling you that flights are really on time and that security is being improved, or Ford is telling you that those Explorers are safe...\\" <br />Elliott and Schroth are firm in their conviction that the executives running companies that have failed should not have been in charge. The authors tell us that these men (and it is interesting that virtually all are men) were simply playing a game: \\"Gamesmanship has replaced business management competence as executives and their boards have focused on managing the stock first, the business second and strategic value last.\\" We have come full circle back to Michael Maccoby's Gamesman of a generation ago, only the 1990s version seems to have no grounding in morals or ethics.<br />The authors rightly take boards of directors to the woodshed, calling them an \\"underperforming asset\\" and pointing out that \\"very few people can tell you exactly how a board adds value to the corporation.\\" It is the board that should provide oversight and review of all corporate practices and hold executives accountable. The always-prescient Peter Drucker wrote back in 1954: \\"A dishonest chief executive can fool an outside board, though not for long if its members demand the information they should be getting and ask the questions they should be asking.\\" Elliott and Schroth argue that \\"boards should be one of the prime intellectual capital assets of the corporation, and their insight into the best practices in business should set a high standard for conduct at the executive level.\\"<br />The authors argue for much greater powers for the SEC to dig into a corporation's books and its accounting practices. They seem to place a great deal of stock in the ability of the SEC to gather real-time information about corporations: \\"Technology has the power to provide real-time detection of potentially fraudulent transactions.\\" Recent news about the SEC suggests that the Commission as currently structured under Harvey Pitt has neither the capability nor the commitment to take on such a task, however.<br />The most blistering chapter is entitled \\"Words Without Foundation,\\" in which the authors ask: \\"Do we have any reason to believe that corporations conduct their business with candor and honesty, and provide accurate reporting to their shareholders?\\" Their answer, sadly, is no. The burden, they argue, will have to be on investors to display a healthy, even aggressive, sense of skepticism toward all financial reports released by publicly-traded companies. <br />The first question investors should ask is \\"Have these numbers been verified, or did you just make this up for me?\\" The assumption must be that even the most reputablecompanies have somehow \\"dressed up\\" their numbers, with help from their accountants, to make themselves look better. An amusing but telling suggestion the authors make is that companies affix stickers on their financial reports with language similar to that found on right-hand mirrors on cars in the U.S: \\"Warning: This corporation may appear to be more capable than it is.\\" <br />The authors focus on five areas where they believe any hope for reform must lie:<br />Accurate and verified communications <BR>Full disclosure of conflicts of interest <BR>Real-time accounting and real-time reporting <BR>Straightforward accounting rules <BR>Real accountability by executives. <BR>They point out where weaknesses lie and offer suggestions for how to improve performance in each area. While we may argue with their prescriptions, Elliott and Schroth succeed in jump-starting the debate over how to avoid Enrons, WorldComs and other collapses in the future.<br />We need more than talk, however. We need a new generation of business leaders who as executives, directors, analysts and auditors, understand that their responsibilities go far beyond themselves and their bank accounts. The question is not how companies lie; it is why their executives lie. Integrity, responsibility, trustworthiness and a strong sense of ethics cannot be legislated. Without these characteristics in the boardrooms, executive suites, law firms, banks, brokerages and accounting firms, the authors will be proven right - that Enron is only the tip of the iceberg.<br />More book reviews is on [...]	2002-08-29

This devastating book has two parts: (1) The Unknown Freud, where the reader gets a picture of Freud as a dictator, a megalomaniac and egotripper. A pope who alone knew the truth and who founded a secret commission to protect his 'church' against the heathen. He was a bad psychoanalyst (e.g. the Wolf Man case) and a venal man (e.g. the catastrophic Horace Fink case, where he tried to get his own hands on some money of the heiress).<br />I agree with the author that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience - statements cannot be tested and the research results cannot be verified uniformly. Although it is not totally without meaning (Karl Popper), it is not a science.<br />(2) the revenge of the repressed<br />A frontal attack on the caste of the psychoanalysts, depicted as 'religious zealots, self-help evangelists, sociopolitical ideologues, and outright charlatans who trade in the ever seductive currency of guilt and blame, while keeping the doctor's fees mounting.'<br />The author is particularly severe with their latest 'school' : the 'recovered memory movement', based on the rape of children by their parents (really!). This lead to false accusations and condemnations of innocent people. No wonder the author predicts an accelerating collapse of psychoanalysis as a respected institution.<br />A much needed and courageous book to halt a profession riding at full speed on a misty highway. And a much needed angle on Freud as a person, written in a style to slaughter the not so innocent father of psychoanalysis.<br />After reading this book, I agree with Peter Medawar, who called doctrinaire psychoanalytic theory \\"the most stupendous intellectual confidence trick of the twentieth century\\".	2002-08-28

His academic credentials are as false as his leadership in an organization he has no real knowledge of. Solomon Tulbure was a very mentally disturbed man. I say WAS because he is now deceased. Solomon claims to have been made the Grand Master of the Illuminati through communications from the Illuminati via a OUIJA board. His accounts of the founding of the Illuminati is completely contrived as well as the nature of modern Freemasonry. I have been a Freemason for almost 20 years. The organizational structure Solomon Tulbure related in his book is fictitious. he could have researched it publically but he was to lazy. At any rate, there is no Illuminati behind this book or Solomon Tulbure. He wrote a book, published it through a vanity publisher and sold it on Amazon.com simply to make money. This was only 1 of several internet related scams created by this man including one stock trading scam. In the end, he jumped off an overpass into oncoming traffic in Knoxville, KY to avoid the legal repercussions of his fraudulant actions. This is not my opinion. This is a fact that can be verified online. The obituaries are a part of the public record. Yes, the man is now deceased. There will be no more copies of this book or any of the others Solomon Tulbure has written.	2002-08-25

He also works at a Colonial Theme park set in 1734 called Colonial Dusboro where he meets his best friend, Denny.  He is however, according to Victor, a frien out of necessity.  It is also about his relationship with a docotr caring for his mother named Paige Marshall who says she can save his mother if he has sex with her.  Oh, one more thing, he pretends to choke to death on food and gets money from the people who save him.<BR>Like \\"Survivor\\" your sympathy is fully engaged from the first page.  He starts narrating the book saying \\"If you're going to read this, don't bother.\\"  He is basicaly saying his life isn't important.  It is a sad book.<BR>It is also, like \\"Fight Club\\" an extremely outrageous novel.  It has its share of humor, most of which occur while he cruises his sexaholics meetings.  <BR>This is a very funny, very entertaining book.

Moreover, it's so well written and engrossing that it is hard to put down - I read it in a weekend.<br />My role regarding security is more process-oriented, although I have a fairly deep knowledge of the technical aspects. I, like many others, assumed that HTTP (port 80 services) poses nominal security exposures.  Before I was finished with the first chapter that erroneous belief had been completely destroyed. What make the magnitude of the risks and exposures of seemingly secure aspects of web systems behind a firewall so real is the way you're walked through how to breach backend systems via HTTP.  In addition, each language and scripting environment commonly used in web systems are examined for security implications. Seeing these was the second major surprise in the book.<br />As the book progresses the technical detail gets deeper, and the ways systems can be breached get more sophisticated.  Each of the exposures that the book highlights can be independently verified by following the procedures given on test systems (of someone else's system if you have a malicious bent).<br />Even if security isn't your major concern you'll greatly benefit from this book because the authors completely explain how web systems work at a deep technical level, and do clearly.  If you are involved in security you'll find exposures and risks in places you never suspected, such in intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and even comments in scripts and mark-up files.<br />This book can be read and understood by moderately technical readers, such as IT managers, and should be read by developers who want to harden their code, auditors and security assessment team members, and systems and network administrators who need to plug the holes left by product defaults or are targets for intruders.ntruders.	2002-08-25

They do this using only the example those adults supply by speaking. While adults do simplify their speech when talking to very young children, we rarely have a formal program of language instruction in mind. Rather, we simplify our speech so that we can be understood. From this input children are able to learn to distinguish words, understand the meaning of words and combine them into sentences. In no time a child is speaking his language and speaking it correctly.<br /> How this process occurs is the topic of Steven Pinker's monograph &quot;Language Learnability and Language Development&quot;. He focuses on how a child can learn the grammar of his language. His approach is quite formal and technical, as is fitting for a professor of linguistics writing for an audience of professional researchers. The ultimate goal is to define a set of algorithms that processes the input (the sentences heard by the child) and creates a set of rules that define the grammar of the language the child is hearing.<br /> Pinker's description of this process begins with the question of word order. A child must determine in what order his language puts words. Should he put the subject before the verb (He runs. vs. Runs he.), should an adjective precede a noun (white house in English, casa blanca in Spanish)? Where should an indirect object go? This isn't easy work. All the child has to go on are the sentences she hears and some non-verbal signals (pointing, tone of voice, the context of the utterance). Actually, the child has a little bit more; Pinker argues, as do many linguists, that we are all born with a mental framework for grammar. This can be imagined as a series of rules with some blanks to be filled in. All of the world's grammars can be described by filling in the blanks differently. So the child is not without some guidance.<br /> Once the child has identified the basic meanings of some of the words this framework for grammar and the algorithms Pinker proposes work together to determine how sentences are constructed. As the child learns more words and more of the basic grammar rules, more difficult notions can be tackled. The text proceeds through topics such as noun-verb agreement, verb forms and irregular verbs, auxiliary verbs (including the troublesome word &quot;do&quot; in English) and the formation of passive constructions. For each issue Pinker describes a framework and a series of rules for filling the blanks.<br /> The fundamental constructs and the nature of the rules require the reader to have some understanding of formal grammars (the transformational grammars of Chomsky or the LFG that Pinker bases his arguments on). Your understanding doesn't have to be deep, but it would be difficult to work your way through the book without some familiarity with the subject. Further the algorithms are given reasonably formally (not purely mathematically, but certainly it requires some effort to piece them together). In some sections of the text you may be  forced, as I was, to simply skim over the details in an attempt gain some understanding.<br /> This is an older text (1984 for the first edition) and Pinker was trying not only to present his results, but--and perhaps most interestingly--develop a method for analyzing any theory of language acquisition. He even uses these criteria to judge his own theories.  He can tell us where his ideas on language acquisition succeed, admits where they fail, and hypothesizes how they can be improved. This methodology defined a successful research program that continues today Pinker makes his case through careful, clear, and compelling arguments. This discipline isn't easy. Most of the experiments one would need to run, in order to validate the theory, would be highly unethical (let's speak to a child only in the passive voice, let's never ask a child a question and see what happens). So the theories have to be verified by the sentences children speak and a few experiments, usually with made up words. Unfortunately, the sentences children speak do not unambiguously tell us the grammar they used to construct them.<br /> I am no expert in this subject matter. I picked up the book because I had enjoyed the books Steven Pinker has written for the interested layman, such as &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, &quot;Words and Rules&quot; and &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;.  I did have to work hard to try to understand the text and I am sure I didn't fully understand some of the more technical arguments.

While not the most well written book of its nature (a few too many unsubstantiated anecdotal stories), the verified facts and statistics will astound you.  Larry Elder has done his homework, and it is truly incredible what he has uncovered and courageously shared with the reader.<br />If you are even the slight bit interested in the current state of race relations, Mr. Elder has two very interesting chapters for you.  Contrary to what a few other reviewers have said, the author decries both the black AND white races for the serious dilemmas facing the black community.  It is not true the white race is solely to blame for black troubles, and I applaud Mr. Elder for boldly stating this unpopular fact. And yes, he does back up his statements with rather frightening (and verifiable) statistics.  The rest of the book delves into politics, the myth of female inequality in the workplace, and media bias.  All are presented in an well organized fashion and flow very well.<br />If you are a free-thinker (as both Republicans and Democrats will find reason to dislike this book) then take the time enrich your mind.

I had read \\"The Night Land\\" and \\"The House On The Borderland and liked them, but \\"Carnacki\\" blew me away. It is a series of stories about a truly scientific ghost hunter who encounters one or two hoaxes as well as real and distinctly individual haunts and what might be called demons. In it the protagonist invented a progressive series of devices and techniques based on deduced and experimentally verified observations. It was a world that \\"hung together\\" and I am surprised that no one really followed up on the concept. Set in Victorian-Edwardian Britain and Ireland the stories have the ring of someone who knows his milieu and the characters definitely seem like people you might know, though Carnacki is definitely an odd bird.<br />I only read one excerpt from \\"Glen Carrig\\", titled, I believe, \\"The Voice In the Mist\\", but that was in an English textbook in grammar school!

After reaching the halfway halfway mark for this book I was overwhelmed with a sense of deja-read -- I've read this book before.  Double checking the title and publication date, I verified that this was, indeed, the first time I've read this title.  Or was it?<br />\\"The Redemption of Althalus,\\" while not the latest from David and Leigh Eddings, is the last in a long series of Fantasy books that follows much the same plot as the others.  Hero A goes off on a grand quest from Deity B to thwart the plots and machinations of Evil Deity C with the assistance of a colorful group of characters, D, E, F, G and H.  For a long-time author, falling into a rut of this size is inexcusable.  <br />This is not to say that the book is completely unenjoyable.  One things that the Eddings team does well is character and dialogue.  However the same character templates are used from book to book.  The perpetrators are the same -- only the names have been changed to protect the innocent, as it were.<br />If you are a fan of David Eddings you'll be disappointed, but you won't find the book completely unreadable.  If you're looking at this book as an introduction to the authors, you owe it to yourself to find a copy of \\"Pawn of Prophecy\\" and start with the good stuff.	2002-07-31

Lee Bailey in 1964 when he got Dr. Sam Shepard freed from a crime he didn't commit. Shepard was railroaded by a sensational and irresponsible newspaper; his life was ruined to sell advertising. Were things different 40 years later? This book tells of some of his cases, and his observations on the law.<br />Part I \\"The Torso Murder\\" tells of finding body parts, and the trial of the husband. There was no direct evidence against the husband; only the claim of a hobbyist polygrapher that the husband failed the \\"lie detector\\". Bailey's examination and comments are printed. A former business associate of the wife saw her weeks after she disappeared. The book tells of the tricks to discredit the witness: the police officer testified his story was false! But they contacted the priest who had accompanied this witness, and who verified the story. The defendant was acquitted. The next chapter tells of a defendant arrested on eyewitness identification years after the crime. The defendant did not match the description given by the victims. Eyewitness identifications are the greatest single cause of wrongful convictions. They were reliable in olden times when an eyewitness generally knew well the accused. <br />Part II reports \\"The Exoneration of Sam Shepard\\". This is so well known that nothing more needs to be said. Dr. Shepard's career was ruined and his life was crippled through false charges, poor investigation, and newspaper propaganda. Part III reports the Great Plymouth Mail Robbery: a million and a half in small bills were stolen from an ordinary mail truck. This crime was never solved, the money never recovered. Two of the suspects disappeared and were never found; possibly kidnapped and tortured to death by criminals. These chapters tell of the actions of the Postal Inspectors; these are facts, not fiction.<br />Part IV deals with the Boston Strangler and the solution to this case. It is a well known case where books have been written about it. PartV deals with the trials of Dr. Carl Coppolino. Tried in NJ for murdering a neighbor (not guilty), but convicted in FL for poisoning his wife. Bailey points out the weaknesses in the expert opinion against his client.<br />Part VI deals with corruption in Paterson NJ. A newspaper publisher who reported on links between underworld elements and the Passaic County Prosecutor was arrested for murder based on suborned perjury! This fact did not prevent two trials and acquittal in both cases. Bailey's appeal to the NJ Governor and others was used to censure him in MA and suspend him in NJ. Does NJ have the worst reputation in the eastern US? Read this chapter and you will understand why.<br />Part VII deals with \\"The State of the Law\\". It tells of the harm done by police lineups (if the victim is shown a mug shot before), the unreliability of eyewitness testimony (someone seen for a few seconds), etc. Innocence is irrelevant for any defendant! Anyone acquitted will forever be suspected as guilty. Bailey tells of the faults of the grand jury system: they are a rubber stamp for the prosecutor. This chapter gives an insider's view to things that are unknown to the public. This last chapter could be a summary of the book.	2002-07-25

The publisher suggests its use in grades 4 - 10.  The textual organization is excellent.  Grouped by year of the war, each of the two dozen or so chapters has background information, an introduction to the main personnage in the story,  a lively, fast paced short incident, and a brief afterword.<br />Then, for each chapter, there are questions that test knowledge gained, suggestions for further research, ideas for reality games and further thought provoking questions.<br />The main character of each brief story is presented as a real person with birth and death dates and some added biographical material.  These dates and this material, however, do not always seem to check out, especially in reference to John Mercer Langston and a character named \\"Mary Livingston\\" who seems to be based on Mary Livermore of the Chicago Sanitary Commission.  If these well known and easily verified historical personnages are presented incorrectly, what is the reader to think of the others?<br />I would have loved to recommend this book.

He is trying to identify what he calls kul/harem  and agricultural serfdom with slavery in the West. He never compares the conditions of the slaves in the west with his classification of slaves in Ottoman Empire, kul/harem subjects, what I call \\"adopted persons\\" or \\"willing to serve for better future\\" like  volunteers in government offices or adoptive children. He can not count more than two digit persons as \\"slaves\\" in the Ottoman Empire while in the west it goes up to millions. He does not compare the conditions of the slaves in the west with conditions of those kul/harem that is far better than most of the Ottoman subjects. He does not see the difference that agricultural servants in Ottoman Empire were kick out by the Russians from Russia yet those in the West were captured. Although he states that most of the families were racing to give away their sons and daughters to so called slavery in Ottoman Empire yet in the West they were hunted. He concludes that lack of study of slavery in Muslim countries is due to political correctness in the west, which is a joke when they make all kinds of studies to tear apart the Holy Qur'an. In summary the information is correct for they can be verified from sources but I totally disagree with the conclusion and especially that there is a cover up.	2002-07-23

As a tendency this is hardly controversial, as witnessed by the fierce protests against it that have erupted especially since \\"The Battle of Seattle\\" of late 1999.  What makes this book more futuristic speculation than hard-headed reporting is 1) the authors' elaborated theory of this new world, and 2) their unsubstantiated assertion that it has already arrived.<br /><br /> Before addressing the people who really ought to read EMPIRE, a few words to those who should not:<br /><br /> 1) CONSERVATIVES -- If you think we live in the best of all possible worlds and that the equations of neoclassical economics are actually true (a fallacy of misplaced concreteness), first you should go read Voltaire's [[ASIN:0393960587 Candide]] and meet Dr. Pangloss, and then you should go live for a year in someplace like Afghanistan or India, in poverty and/or under U.S. bombs.  You'll get nothing from this book until you have a radical epiphany.<br /><br /> 2) ARMCHAIR POSTMODERNISTS -- I know you have probably already read this and are on to some newer fad now, but if not, don't bother.  Rereading Deleuze & Guattari's [[ASIN:0816614024 A Thousand Plateaus]] will be much more exciting.  Yeah, H&N use Foucault and \\"biopower,\\" but it doesn't add anything crucial to their argument.<br /><br /> 3) THOSE FEW PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT RECENT DEBATES IN MARXISM -- Yes, I know, you're likely to have read it too, to see what the fuss was about.  But if not, it's not the most profound of recent attempts to update Karl.  (Take a look at Moishe Postone's [[ASIN:0521565405 Time, Labor, and Social Domination]].)  If you're interested in Negri, you're better off reading [[ASIN:074563513X The Politics of Subversion]], and watch for his lynchpin argument about the real subsumption of value -- I think he's all wrong, and it reveals his Eurocentric viewpoint.<br /><br /> So who SHOULD read this book?  Young anti-globalization activists and anyone else who is burning with desire not only to understand the world, but to understand it so that they can more effectively CHANGE it, as the Old Moor advocated (in his 11th Thesis on Fuerbach, if you want to look it up).  It's not the gospel, in fact I think it's seriously wrong-headed in many ways, but it is a serious attempt to grapple with what is changing and how, and is intended as a tool for activists.  It is packed with useful information on the history of capitalism, and places assessments of the 20th century in the longer view since its complex origins -- like Marx, H&N see the ongoing dialectical development of capital as progressive, and this partly accounts for the book's positive reception in places like the New York Times.<br /><br /> EMPIRE is relentlessly optimistic in its radical outlook, in the faith that it is \\"the multitude,\\" not the elites, that has the power to reshape the world.

But Moore's tongue and cheek approach makes `Stupid White Men' imminently enjoyable, a satire laden with facts and information, some which I already had verified before reading them here.<br />And what he points out in simple, no-nonsense terms is that; we as a nation are in big trouble.<br />I [dislike] Republicans; they're evil ....  Democrats, he illustrates by listing all of these so-called liberals and the percentages by which they voted in Republican polices, have sold us all out and are nothing more than the second Republican party. He also doesn't fret to point out those Republicans who voted against some of [George Bush's]policies, such as drilling for oil in Alaska to sell to Japan. The myth that the Democrats fought for the little guy has been dead for a long time, `Stupid White Men' simply knocks the last few nails into the coffin.<br />His chapter entitled `Kill Whitey' is highly amusing, while at the same time provocative as he recounts that every lousy thing that people have done to him in his life, has been done by white people. And yet the so-called liberal media (sicker) demonizes blacks as if they are the sole cause of the nation's ills, when it's pretty clear to anyone who doesn't read Rush Limbaugh or listen to Pat Buchanon, that this is clearly not the case. `Idiot Nation' is his look at the out-right attack Republicans and everyone else are making on the nations schools. They slash funding, gut libraries and pay teachers nothing then have the audacity to wonder why our schools are so lousy. Then use it as an excuse to want to privatize them or use their state as an excuse for their voucher program for religious schools. Because they know they can't cram religion down our throats in public schools, because that darn old Constitution keeps getting in the way.<br />I didn't really care for his section on world problems, like the Middle East or Ireland. Yes, what is he said right, but his little letter to Arafat about passive resistance and civil disobedience just didn't seem appropriate given the seriousness of the situation. However, I suspect Mike was succumbing to the frustration we all feel whenever a suicide bomber blows up a night club in Tel Aviv or Israely soldiers gun down a bunch of students throwing rocks, and the helplessness that comes with both. Neither the Right nor the Left have answer for this one, I'm afraid. About the only thing we can all agree upon is that is has to stop. Soon.<br />There is more, but I can't help myself from turning this review into a rant or my own soap box (surely not! ed.) So the only real option is to buy it and read it for yourself. From what I have heard, it keeps selling so fast that it's already in its 19th printing. ... Maybe Mike's right- maybe we need to boot these `Stupid White Men'out of power, because what they're doing just ain't working.	2002-07-21

It's about using the creative side of the brain to write, which is a concept only recently verified and documented by psychologists. Today they call it &quot;using the right side of the brain.&quot; Gabrielle Rico (WRITING THE NATURAL WAY) wrote the first modern books for writers on the subject 30 years after Brande wrote hers.<br />Ms. Brande, writing in 1934, speaks of &quot;the two sides of the writer.&quot; One side is the author, with the child's innocence of eye, spontaneous, sensitive, able to respond freshly and quickly to new scenes. The other side is the artisan, adult, discriminating, temperate and just. Right brain, left brain.<br />Brande advocates separating the two and gives a series of exercises designed to train the author side to respond willingly. By careful self-training the writer/reader will harness the unconscious and harvest its benefits.<br />Try the exercises -- they work. <br />If you're interested in writing or just in how creative processes work, you'll find this an amazing and useful book.	2002-07-15

Most importantly, it is the only book I've found that addresses the mainframe environment and java. Another good choice for getting started in rudimentary java is &quot;Java for the COBOL Programmer&quot; by Doke and Hardgrave. That book does a better job of teaching the COBOL person but is just a starter book. Developing Mainframe Java applications has wider depth and range.	2002-07-11

In books on tape a lot depends on the reader. A fine reader can make a poor book sound good. Rohan's an excellent reader.<br />When authorities are called to the scene of a spectacularly gruesome murder of an elderly couple by their retarded grandson, Jonathan Hamilton, they immediately assume that he's the perpetrator. The assumption is seemingly verified by his confession when taken into custody. As the story unfolds, though, the actions of those authorities come under question. Evidence such as blood on Jonathan's forehead and hands and bloody footprints solidify opinions against the young man.<br />Matthew Fielder, a big-city criminal defense lawyer drop-out, especially trained to handle \\"death cases,\\" is assigned to defend Jonathan and the more he learns about the case, the more he's convinced that Jonathan is innocent. The battle lines are drawn and both sides go for the jugular as the trial commences, its fury fed by the media into a frenzy.<br />A chilling story, laced with legal detail and feisty, memorable characters, FLAT LAKE IN WINTER is just the tale to see you through a quiet, fall evening. Klempner's legal fiction compares pretty favorably with Grisham's.	2002-07-02

DiLorenzo, while no doubt the possessor of a perspective entailing some few valid points, has presented a blatantly biased partisan view in this work. While there remain too many issues to address within a single review (most easily answered), I would like to briefly tackle the fundamental topic of which the book and several reviews revolve around: a central Federal government vs. a loose union of essentially sovereign states. Historically, this issue grew from the split of Jefferson and Hamilton and was generally responsible for the development of the two-party political system in America. Until the Civil War (or more specifically, the Congressional sessions occurring during it), this debate raged between the Democratic Party and their various rival party, from the Federalists to the Republicans. A concise argument against a decentralized government and the logic of the Confederacy can be shown in two focal points:<br /> 1. The government of a loose confederacy of sovereign states was at one time implemented. Between the end of the Revolution and the adoption of the Constitution, the government existed under the Articles of Confederation. This lame duck government consistently failed or measured close to collapse (Shay's Rebellion), enough that the \\"founding fathers\\" intended reform. To keep the argument succinct, this led to the Constitution, which emphatically and decisively structured a centralized government.<br /> 2. Rebellion, not secession, was considered a right. This can be verified in a simple reading of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. Secession, the ultimate example of states' rights, is a concept that undermines the fundamental ideals of Democracy. This concept of secession basically entails the rights of a minority to break apart from the majority whenever the latter would not concede to its demands. Democracy can not exist under this idea as a unified whole governed through majority rule would quickly shatter in several factions. The Confederacy itself, to any active historian, was seen to be splintering and nearly collapsing at several points due to its own fundamental basis (examine the relation of Davis to several state governors, in particular). Lincoln, by refusing to concede to this powerful minority faction, perpetuated and ensured the survival of democracy in the United States and its form government. In doing so, he obeyed his legal Constitutional mandate of protecting the Constitution and Union by following executive powers given to him. Like several politicians before (namely Jackson) and after him (too numerous to mention), Lincoln made legal use of I, 8, 18 (the elastic clause) to justify any actions which may be considered \\"stretching\\" his executive powers. In summarily conclusion of this topic, I would suggest that all concerned take the time to fully investigate the issue for themselves, as it is too wide and deep a debate to adopt any single, complete stance on.<br />  I would like to attempt to clarify some few other points raised in the reader reviews. Firstly, the \\"Whig economic plan\\" (first proposed by Hamilton, a Federalist) was not the sole motivation for the war. This plan, admittedly against the interest of the primarily - southern agrarian group, was structured to help the United States progress in accord with the market/industrialization \\"revolution\\" and its commercial supporters. Again, this (inevitable?) split of interests dates back to Jefferson and Hamilton. This was hardly a partisan issue though, as the election results of 1860 prove. It may be better termed at this point in history as a sectional issue. The majority of the country, namely both the North and West, approved of the \\"Whig economic plan,\\" which had been up to that point blocked by Southern control of the government (see Buchanan, \\"Virginian Dynasty\\") representing elite minority interests, not including non-slaveholding southern white citizens. Secondly, Lincoln \\"as righteous opponent of slavery\\" does indeed have \\"roots in the man's career. Lincoln's personal feelings of anti-slavery are well-documented and possess no relevance towards his political agenda. I would agree that Lincoln's role in opposition to slavery did play as role as emancipation was a major campaign platform in his second campaign for the presidency in 1864, which he won after nearly four years of the war had been experienced. I would suggest this is \\"a reason why genuine abolitionists, like Frederick Douglass\\" endorsed him. Indeed, as Lincoln's second inaugural ceremony, Douglass was personally received by Lincoln and actively participated in the ceremonies. And lest we forget, Lincoln's personal efforts and sponsorship did produce the Thirteenth Amendment. Thirdly, the statement that \\"what is not mentioned in the Constitution remains a right of the states\\" (known as the Tenth Amendment) can not be applied in the issue of secession as the Constitution expressly delegates the power to preserve the Union and Constitution to the executive office, including the right to cease treasonable activity (in a military sense), as in the case of Clement Vallandigham. Even contemporary secessionist southerners, including Davis, Stephens, and Toombs, recognized this and formally rejected the Constitution in the name of rebellion to justify their cause. Fourthly, I find no records of Mason, Slidell, or any other Confederate diplomat formally proposing an end to slavery in exchange for foreign recognition. However, the point is moot, as the Palmerston ministry (the British government of the time) never seriously considered recognition of the Confederacy in \\"exchange\\" for the discontinuance of slavery. Indeed, in my personal view, the principled men of the British government would have considered such a form of persuasion to be blackmail of a sort. Fifthly, indisputable statistics do show that the vast majority of white Southerners did not own slaves. However, as can be simply and obviously noted in the simple number of Confederate soldiers, the vast majority of Southerners supported slavery.<br />  I seem to have neared the limit for a review. A final piece of advice: search for an objective view of history. Read this if you will, but balance it with other historians' perspectives before accepting Mr. DiLorenzo's theses. Better yet, ignore this work and explore serious studies of the Civil War, regardless of their position.slavery\\" does indeed have \\"roots in the man's career.

Based on the other reviews, I think that is a valid point to start with.<br />The book contained almost 40 pages of references alone.  This was a well reasoned book with a great deal of supporting evidence.  The supporting evidence is well documented and can be verified by anyone, including exactly where the sources are found, LexisNexis.<br />The book was amusing to read and kept you going most of the time.  There were points at which it felt a bit belabored.  I do not think this is so much a fault of the author, but more a result of the content.  It indicates the constant repetition of the media in their treatment of conservatives, using the same old adjectives over and over.<br />I particularly liked the discussion of the religious right.  It is absolutely hilarious to hear the media constantly talk about it as though it is an actual organization with members and leadership, etc.<br />To be part of the 'religious right', you need only 2 things, 1. Be an evangelical christian, 2. Be a Republican.<br />There is no central leadership, not Buchanan, Robertson, Falwell, or Bauer.  There is no yearly dues, no organized bloc voting, no secret meetings.  It is just a subset of unaffiliated people who are socially conservative and fiscally conservative.<br />In closing, the book was interesting, it was well documented, and it was accurate.  It could have been 30 pages shorter, as the extra content was alot more of the same, which re-enforced the point of how pervasive this 'slander' is, but did make for a bit much repetition.	2002-07-01

Dr. Swinford really delivers on what the back cover says.  It reads:  \\"We are preoccupied with the future.  What will tomorrow bring?  What does my future hold?  To most people it is the central question.  If they were given one wish it would be to know the future.  But the future is not only our wish, but also our fear.  What will tomorrow bring?  What will happen?  We try to find peace of mind by believing that tomorrow will be pretty much like today, that the agenda we have set out for tomorrow will actually come to pass just as we have planned it.  Deep inside we know the truth, however, and that is the source of our fear.  It only takes one phone call, one unexpected occurrence, a few words from a physician, and our life is changed forever.  This is the deep-seated, universal fear.  An unimaginable amount of money is spent trying to overcome this fear.  We employ analysts, forecasters, and even fortune-tellers to try and reassure us about the future.  The amount spent on each is usually determined by the accuracy of their track record.  But at the best these are guesses and at the worst they are frauds.  In this book Dr. Swinford shows that there is a way to know the future, and it's free and readily accessible to everyone.  Even better, it has a track record that can be verified to be 100% accurate.\\"<BR>     This book is about the prophecies of Daniel, found in the Bible, and how they have proven to have come true even though the majority of them were written centuries before their fulfillments.  Dr. Swinford documents them very well, and shows that these fulfillments can be verified by looking in any encyclopedia.  He also shows that there are a number of prophecies in the Book of Daniel that have not been fulfilled yet and discusses these prophecies in great detail as well.<BR>     The book is written in an easy to read style that will be enjoyable by just about anybody, so you won't be blown away by academic verbiage in this book.  I enjoyed this book tremendously and rate it at 5 out of 5 Stars.	2002-07-01

I love the notion of morons offing themselves through their own stupidity.  Now that someone has decided to cash in by putting them in book form, they have unfortunately lost their charm.  Problem number one is that in order to pad the material for now two full volumes, lots of stuff has been put in that doesn't belong.  Many of these so-called \\"winners\\" don't deserve Darwins because either 1). they didn't die or 2). the story itself is either unverified or an actual urban legend.  The author also throws in a lot of stupid criminal anecdotes, which also don't deserve Darwins and are the same exact stories that have previous appeared in things like News of the Weird.<br />The other comment I would make is that the Darwin Awards were written up to much funnier effect when they were being posted anonymously on the Internet.

US	50288264	R3CAOWAY12M33E	1841620300	684026143	Ghana, 2nd: The Bradt Travel Guide	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Some thoughts on Briggs' Second edition, guide to Ghana...	<br />In that this follows a number of other reviews of Philip Briggs' \\"Ghana--The Bradt Travel Guide\\" (second edition), there may be a \\"coals to Newcastle\\" aspect to my comments.  I found the first edition, recommended by a Ghanaian friend, very helpful on a trip to Ghana in February of 2001.  I've since bought the second (updated and expanded) edition, and find it as readable as the first, as well as continuing to give a reasonable level of detail about getting around, places to stay, and things to see.  There are some pet items that in my view would have warranted mention, such as the universities in Cape Coast and Kumasi, but it's not reasonable to expect everything about a country to show up in 354 pages.  Having worked in Ghana years ago, I was not starting from zero when picking up Briggs' book.  I had also been checking with a few Ghanaian friends, and had been looking into websites.  Maybe that's the main point to make:  No single source of information, even a very good guidebook such as this one, can be entirely complete and up-to-date.<br />From the U.S., at least, your visa application may be your first encounter with Ghanaian bureaucracy.  Unless you live close to the embassy in Washington or the consulate in New York, get started at least two months in advance.  Once in Ghana, you'll need to get adjusted to some third-world realities.  Those used to North American and European infrastructure and scheduling efficiency may have to remind themselves that things really will typically take longer, that power and water outages can be frequent, that transportation will not always be fully predictable, and that breakdowns should not be a surprise.  Get on the road early whenever possible, make sure that you fill that bucket in the bathroom promptly on arrival, and keep a flashlight handy.  Ghana is not, in short, the sort of \\"autofocus\\" vacation area that we may tend to expect, but instead qualifies as your \\"grittier, more economical, more authentic African experience\\".  Keep in mind that if you have travelled all day and arrived somewhere hot, sweaty, dusty and grimy, that your initial impression of a destination will probably not be as favorable as it will be a day later, once you have had the chance to clean up, rest up, and get calibrated to the place.  Ghanaians pointed out to us, and our experience verified, that transportation functions more efficiently in southern and central Ghana than it does further north, and one should plan accordingly.  Philip Briggs' guide to Ghana will definitely help in that planning.	2002-06-26

Dr. Sarno isn't what one would call a a crank by any means.   In his own practice  he is well reputed, otherwise he would not be teaching at the NYU School of Medicine.   But he appeals to those who read junk science because they desperately need something to believe in.   His stories are anecdotal.  There is  no serious reference to or documentation for actual studies that can be verified by the reader / researcher -- instead gushing testimonials from fans.   The unconscious mind is indeed suggestible, as he says.  Where he goes wrong, is his assumption that today most people with chronic pain have repressed their resentments.  Not in this day and age.   This is the age of the victim -- where people have been taught it's OK to be resentful!   He quotes Kenneth Pelletier (my own therapist) who told me he had an 80-year client who spent every session \\"railing about his cruel mother.\\"  Ironically every other mental health professional cited in his book has stated, in some manner in his/her book, that a focus on negative emotions is what CAUSES pain, and that it must be let go.  Sarno is recommending the opposite, that pain is associated with some \\"hidden resentment,\\" and it must be called up every time the pain surfaces.  If that is what you teach your \\"suggestible mind,\\" then, you will train it to make that connection.  I would ask Dr. Sarno, how do you explain the same kinds of chronic pain in ANIMALS?   They don't even know the meaning of \\"resentment,\\" let alone have hidden ones.   Many people are convinced prayer works, and because they are blinded by their belief that \\"someone 'up there' cares,\\" they feel they are healed.  It may work, but it's pure shamanism.	2002-06-25

Solitary practitioners will find no more thorough a reference manual for your personal practice. Pagans will find here the \\"Book of Shadows\\" of Golden Dawn magic. Thelemites will find Liber O on steroids.<br /><br />Griffin's Ritual Magic Manual contains a complete collection of Golden Dawn astrological, Qabalistic, and elemental invocations, with everything you need to practice NOW. Each ritual has the correct Golden Dawn sigils, Egyptian God Forms, Hebrew names of power, correct invoking and banishing pentagrams and hexagrams, etc,  ALL IN ONE PLACE and ready to use.<br /><br />The manual has been accused of being repetitive, but it is after all a manual to use as a reference work and not a book to read cover to cover and the book does not pretend to be anything else. Those who criticize its size, apparently do not practice Ritual Magic on a regular basis and thus have no need for a Mars ritual of a Pisces invocation.<br /><br />The purpose of the invocation of each Zodiacal, Planetary, and Elemental magical force is spelled out in a special chapter on \\"Practical and Talismanic Magic.\\" This material you will find in no other book on the Golden Dawn.<br /><br />It has been said elsewhere that you could find everything available in this book in Regardie's huge tome, \\"The Golden Dawn.\\" Whereas this can indeed be said about most Golden Dawn books on the market, that is not at all the case with this book. Anyone who makes such a claim has clearly never used this book as a reference manual as an adjunct to their magical practice.<br /><br />There are many new Enochian developments in this book you find nowhere else as well. Mathers died only having integrated the Enochian material in the GD system of Elemental magic. He never finished the same with planetary magic or zodiacal magic. Griffin completed the job.<br /><br />Also, Griffin's analysis ofDee's diacritical marks on the original manuscripts was groundbreaking, and has subsequently been copied by numerous other authors, of course without crediting Griffin! Griffin has cleaned up the pronunciation of the Enochian calls as well, going back to the original source material and eliminating a lot of superfluous sounds the GD added (\\"Zacar\\" vs. Zod-a-ca-ray\\") thus returning the calls to the original beauty of the Angelical Enochian language. As a linguist, Griffin handled this task superbly.<br /><br />One reviewer criticized this book saying that the Enochian tablets are wrong. This is a matter of opinion. There are problems inherent in the original Enochian manuscripts. The GD put multiple letters in some squares to solve the problem of the multiple versions in the originals. In short, the GD founders could not make up their mind, so they used all of them. Griffin argues, quite reasonably, that the corrected one if the final one, the version corrected by Raphael in the Dee manuscripts.<br /><br />Those who find this change arbitrary or call it an \\"error\\" obviously are not familiar with the original John Dee manuscripts and have not read the footnotes in Griffin's or the scholarly articles in its appendix, especially \\"The Book of the Concourse of Planetary and Zodiacal forces\\" where Griffin explains in detail the manner in which he included the Enochian material for Planetary and Zodiacal magic in the book in the same manner that Mathers originally integrated the Enochian material for Elemental magic. The manner that Griffin reconciled the planetary arrangement of the Heptarchia Mystica with the Golden Dawn planetary arrangement by noticing that the planetary arrangement in the Vault of the Adepti grants a perfect match with Heptarchia Mystica is nothing short of brilliant. I personally find this book worth the original $49 just for this one paper, relegated only to an appendix! Those who find nothing to read in this book will find plenty of meat in just this one article alone.<br /><br />There are also many corrections to Regardie's hierarchies that come from earlier sources that are carefully footnoted in Griffin's book. Many of these corrections still a decade later are remain nowhere else, which is surprising consdering all of the GD scholorship going on. For example, Griffin discovered that the spirit of saturn (Cassiel according to Regardie) is actually Kaphziel, which a nothing more than a Qabalistic inversion of two letters of the name of the spirit of Jupiter, Zaphquiel, thus making it malefic (Saturn) through an inversion of the energies of Jupiter. All of this is not only correced, but carefully footnoted as well, showing where Griffin found the original Hebrew spelling in an earlier Hebrew magical manuscript.<br /><br />Some people call these changes \\"errors\\" merely because they do not bother to read the footnotes! Here you have everything all in one place, with all magical hierarchies verified or corrected from pre Golden Dawn source material and carefully footnoted as to why corrections have been made.<br /><br />Granted, at first glance you might not notice these things, but you come to appreciate them as you use this book as a reference book adjunct to you magical practice. Griffin found earlier, pre-Golden Dawn sources for all of the magical hierarchies, and uncovered and corrected numerous errors. None of these changes are arbitrary, but are carefully documented in footnotes.<br /><br />None of this is to be found in Regardie's book where you have to wade through hundreds of pages of unrelated Masonic style rituals and search through many hundreds of pages, just to get a few hints at how to put it all together to practice Golden Dawn Ritual Magic. So how does Regardie's book have everything this one does? Clearly, these books serve two completely different functions. It is like comparing apples and pears!<br /><br />So people like apples better. Fine. So what? Regardie's book is a collection of Golden Dawn papers and rituals. This book is a reference book for the practicing magician. You will not find such a complete reference manual anywhere else, nor such a well researched one and well footnoted one either.<br /><br />This is all not to mention how, to use Regardie's book for Ritual MAgic,  you would need to first to master how to trace sigils, complete the incomplete set of Egyptian God Forms, study John Dee to figure out how to integrate the Heptarchia Mystica material into GD magic, study ancient Qabalistic magical manuscripts to find the errors in Regardie's Hebrew spellings, etc.<br /><br />It is no wonder that some competing Golden Dawn leaders hate this book and have sent their members to write biased, negative reviews. They are terrified of this book. Griffin has given away their entire magical store almost for free in just one volume.<br /><br />I personally find this book one of the two best researched and most carefully documented books on magic on the market today. Donald Tyson's edition of Agrippa's Three Books on Magic is the other.<br /><br />The only thing I do not like about this book is its outrageous price. The book originally sold for $49 which was a bargain. Then in 2003, Griffin pulled the book out of print making its content instead available only in the coursework of the Hermetic Orde of the Golden Dawn, the Outer Order of the Rosicrucian Order of Alpha et Omega (HOGD/AO).<br /><br />This resulted in a huge amount of scalping of whatever books were left. I have seen them here for as much as $1,000. This is ridiculous and begs the question:<br /><br />\\"Mr. Griffin, when will you release a 2d edition? There are many of us who want this book, but can't afford paying $1,000!. A second edition is long overdue for those of us who do not want to join any Golden Dawn order, but still want to practice its magic.\\"	2002-06-25

The family motto: &quot;Don't believe in anything unless it can be scientifically verified.&quot;  Religion went the way of Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.  Nice to believe in, but not reality.<br />I had what what most would call a subjective &quot;religious experience&quot; which allowed me to be open to other ideas.  Because of my background, someone made this book available to me.  This book (and others) presented new ways of thinking about life on this planet.  It presented biochemical and physiological challenges that were thought provoking.<br />I recommend you read it along with many many other books.  Especially Darwin's &quot;Origin.&quot;  Also, read books/material that are critical of Creationism (blind watchmaker, internet infidels, National Association for Science Education)  You will begin to see an unfortunate pattern of people talking past one another.  But you continue reading.  Read Science, Nature, books on Geology, Biology, Astronomy... but be skeptical.... be critical... evaluate their claims against their data.  Look for presuppositional influences.  Look for good logical arguements, and be willing to agree with what makes sense.  Better still, look at their findings, and try to determine if the Creator's hand is involved.  Use your mind, not someone else's.<br />Make science fun, adventuresome, and intellectually honest.<br />I now believe I adhere to the family motto better than my family ever did.  The evidence of design and of a Creator's intervention in Biology, Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, Philosophy, and History put the theist on solid ground evidentially.  <br />There are only two kinds of people who will read this book:<BR>1. people who are willing to doubt evolution<BR>2. people who are not willing to doubt evolution<br />Either will find in this book precisely what they are looking for.  One will be wrong.  And I know which one.<br />Cheers!	2002-06-25

This work attempts to summarize information from manufacturers' applications notes, trade magazines, and professional publications. It provides little (if any) original content. The greatest strength of this book is the extensive list of references.<BR>The content was disappointing however. The book stays at the surface of the subject. When it occasionally attempts depth it is of questionable accuracy. Knowledgeable readers will identify minor quibbles to completely incorrect statements. There are also a few discussions that make no sense, use unusual/confusing terminology, or take the reader down a path to incorrect interpretations of the meaning. <BR>The \\"packages\\" content seems to be an afterthought, in some sections the text is written solely as if the book was only about die measurements.<BR>To summarize: This is a useful read even for experienced microwave probers, but read with caution.

This book is fairly well written, but the ending chapters and appendicies appear to have been assembled in haste and are somewhat of a letdown. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that Clayson often seemed unaccountably mean-spirited toward Harrison. Come to think of it, he gets in digs at James Taylor, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen and several others mentioned in the book, all with very little explanation. Clayson also fails to tie up many threads in Harrison's life, including his relationship with Paul McCartney, who of course brought George into the Quarrymen.  George's friendship with Ravi Shankar is also slighted (Shankar described this quite well - including their work together in the 1990s - in the book Raga Mala). The book needs a summing up of Harrison's life, but instead ends with an intriguing but perhaps unverified story of George meeting &amp; jamming with some country and western musicians during his first visit to the U.S. Perhaps a better accounting of George Harrison's life will be possible after some of his unreleased recordings become available and his family and friends have opened up to someone better suited than Alan Clayson to tell George's story.	2002-06-23

Willy-nilly he has broken the door down and brought his 'design' consideration (I won't say 'argument') into the scientific domain, if not fully across the threshold of scientific proof, as far as I can tell. And you are on your own here, since even many of the supposed scientific counterarguments are little more than party line fiat. Before embarking on this subject, it is important to recall the Kantian skepticism and disproofs of the Argument by Design, and know the odds against design arguments in general. Dembski has two strikes against him to start. And this book is a cliffhanger as Dembski takes a wallop with his third strike. Fascinating. But this issue of proofs of divinity isn't really Dembski's business, as he embarks on a complex exploration of the factor of information as this impinges on the clear inadequacy of the standard Darwinian claims that random mutation and natural selection can make the ascent to complexity that we see as evolutionary fact. But the problem is that an argument about 'design' is taken in practice as precisely an argument by design in other contexts, rendering the whole game ambiguous. The question of frontloaded anthropic factors versus 'late interrupt' emergence of information is one that should be brought back to discussion, as here, stripped of theological or miraculous metaphors is a real head scratcher. Even if his arguments fail upon deeper review, the reality he deals with remains tabled, and too often disregarded by Darwinian thinkers, for whom, Darwin's theory is unverified dogma. Dembski is often challenged for lack of peer review, which is unfair. The credentials of his original _Design Inference_ were adequate enough, and this short version is well within science discourse. In fact, I find this work an unofficial and always still challengeable bit of peer review of its own, as it is infrequent for someone with the proper math skills to give Darwinism a once-over. The material on the No Free Lunch theorems alone is a useful one. Which doesn't make his version correct. All this said, such complex technical arguments always have their day, and can easily be found wanting themselves. It is hard to improve on Socrates original observation on this distinction of intelligent design and natural cause. It is a useful challenge to be confronted with some tough math here (not so tough, nor really decisive), and one's endorsement is on hold during that catch-up and this in the constant disinformation by the fibs, white 'lies' and Darwinian statistics that throw everyone off scent. Grappling with the missing factor in theories of evolution, and it need not even be called 'design', remains the great quest for any real theory of evolution. I cannot quite say this is that science, but neither is Darwin's and Darwin's theory joins Dembski's in the strange limbo pointed to by Bacon, where the formal and final arguments of Aristotle are, or are not, to be included in the scientific domain. If they are, then theories of evolution hazard the metaphysical. The claims of Darwin to resolve these metaphysical issues in one stroke then are clearly wrong.<br />Dembski has an exposed flank with his very use of the term 'design', both as to the equal need, next to the Darwinist, of empirical verification of his theories, and the question raised by issues of 'design' in history, confused with necessity. Shall we take the evolution of religion (and in, say, the Axial period, atheistic and theistic religions in parallel) as chance, necessity, or design? Dembski has here outsmarted himself, for this 'design' question won't sit well with historical theism's claims. Thus we see this 'design' argument is of no help to the theological conservative, and faith cannot be brought to historical data that is now rendered over to this 'design semi-science' that now claims religious emergence as possibly itself evolution.<br />It is also true that the use of the term 'intelligent' in the term 'intelligent design' is in the end hopelessly ambiguous, as is the challenge to methodological naturalism, which is routinely extended in other religious traditions. Since intelligence should be natural, and not be applicable to divinity, we are left with a need to ask what this refers to at all. We cannot say that the examples in practice of 'design' in human agents is counter to naturalism! The question might be better backtracked to terminology of evolutionary directionality, and/or teleology, that dragon the Darwinist rightly fears, and whose fiery breath is destined to scorch Darwin's fond little 'my theory'. This work by Dempski will promptly be exploited for theological purposes, or pseudo-supernatural speculations. None of this follows as such.sm's claims.

Geometric Map of Jerusalem preserved in paintings.	I am writing a third favorable review of \\"The Tomb of God\\" (others -- 05/24/00 and 09/01/98), because after studying the geometric method used by the authors to solve the puzzle of the parchments and the paintings of the Rennes-le-Chateau mystery, I have applied their \\"Teniers Method\\" to the paintings of J. Vermeer (1632-1675), a famous Dutch master painter. The fact that this method uncovered for me the concealment of a secret geometric map of Jerusalem and southern France in at least 8 of Vermeer's masterpieces is testimony to the reliability and credibility of the authors...\\"Tomb of God\\" is a difficult book for anyone who expects light reading. Appreciating it hinges on the reader's ability and determination to follow geometric analyses of ancient parchments and paintings. Those who were unable or unwilling to do so dismiss the book in the harshest terms; many who verified the geometry for themselves -- or who trusted the authors' expertise -- were rewarded with a stunning discovery, and they rated this book the 5 stars it deserves. This is a controversial book because the authors refute the claims of other investigators. I am in agreement with these refutations, for I am familiar with the refuted work. This is an ultracontroversial book because the authors have jumped to a conclusion about Jesus Christ that few are able to share -- myself included. This book is important enough that the BBC of London devoted a documentary to the discrediting of the authors -- a sure sign that the book touched a sensitive nerve. This book is worth the attention of serious students of many disciplines: history of maps, paintings, Christianity, Judaism, the Crusades, Knights Templars, Rennes-le-Chateau, Freemasonry, and the Holy Grail legends and romances. Highest recommendation.	2002-06-19

But it does dispel a few European myths about the Sultan's love life--for instance, the myth that he tossed a handkerchief to the woman with whom he wished to spend the night.  Only Sultan Ibrahim the Mad (1640-8) seems to have lived down to our expectations.  According to Demetrius Cantemir (his biographer):<br />\\"'As Murad [Mad Murad, the previous sultan] was wholly addicted to wine, so was Ibrahim to lust...He cover'd the walls of his chamber with looking glass, that his love-battles might seem to be acted in several places at once...he put whole sable skins under him, in a notion that his lust would be inflam'd, if his love-toil were render'd more difficult by the glowing of his knees...'\\"<br />Mostly, the author writes about the politics of the seraglio:  the power of the Sultan's mother, the 'valide sultan'; the imprisonment and frequent murder of his brothers; the hierarchy of concubines, wives, favorites, and eunuchs.  It's quite a fascinating and beautiful, self-absorbed world, although I wouldn't have wanted to have been one of the Sultan's brothers.  It's no wonder three Sultans in a row went mad while they were imprisoned by the previous ruler (before Mad Murad came Sultan Mustafa, whose \\"mental condition had not been generally known he became sultan, but then it became obvious to all who came into contact with him that he was insane and incapable of ruling on his own...\\"<br />Many of the Osmanli Sultans were deposed and reincarcerated by their relatives, and the rumor about their concubines ending up in a sack in the Bosphorus seems to be verified by the author.<br />All in all during Osmanli rule, it was a bad time to be a Sultan's brother, or a deposed Sultan's concubine.<br />If you'd like to read about the public lives of the sultans, try \\"The Decline and Fall of the Ottoman Empire,\\" by Alan Palmer.

Political correctness would be really funny if the results weren't so tragic.<br />Satel deplores the dismissal of requiring individuals from taking personal responsibility for their health and instead focusing on the supposedly oppressive environment around them that is making them a sick victim of white male-dominated society. People who are pathologically anti-white male and anti-racist have infiltrated key positions in medical education and medical industry and promote their poisonous political views to their helpless patients.<br />Satel does a critique of alternative medicine particularly regarding therapeutic touch, a medical fad that she says has not been proven to be effective in any clinical studies. She says that PC medicine's theories and remedies for how a person gets sick or well have not been researched properly or their statistical results are flawed and supposed descrimination in medical care can be explained by other reasons such as the physiological and cultural differences between the sexes or races. <br />PC medicine emphasizes the post-modernism of Michel Foucault in which the dominant culture is oppressing minorities and this oppression results in sickness. The dominant culture of white males must be done away with to improve minority health. It also emphasizes quasi-marxist radical egalitaritarism in which the patients are to participate in their healing instead of relying on the expertise of the doctor. Therefore, psychiatric patients view themselves as victims of their treatment. This egalitarian view tries to explain differences in health care and the health of different groups as a matter of unwarranted privilege and discrimination when other more reasonable explanations are presented by Satel.<br />This is a well written book that is more interesting thanit initially seems. Post-modern political correctness and pseudo-intellectualism was bad enough in the humanities department, but now that it has invaded the practical realms of healing, it has made health-care less efficient. Satel advises getting back to solving health care problems by getting back to the practical basics of health care: personal responsibility for one's own health and scientifically-verified treatments and research studies that actually improve public health.	2002-06-08

This paradigm goes to a far deeper, more powerful level than the extremely limited definition of 'law' that we as humans have construed to be the ultimate order of life. According to the Constitution of India fulfilled through Maharishi's Transcendental Meditation, silence is the home of pure order. It is fascinating to think that we could create lasting harmony and happiness on earth simply by enlivening this field of silence within our own being.

I do not doubt the merits of such a program but I find it interesting that we insist on the latest in software and computer technology but are still using outdated systems to utilising the brilliance of the human machine in creating change.<br />Most recent thinking acknowledges that all human behaviour, learning and change occur at the unconscious level. That is, at the level of the programs we are running, the coding behind the behaviour. To be lasting and effective, change must occur at this level. My own experience of many years counselling and coaching has verified this dictum. <br />I believe that NLP `the study of excellence' has always had the `answers'. The difficulty hasarisen in the somewhat theoretical, academic (and to many) abstract `packaging' of its tools and methodology, which has made it inaccessible to the `many'.<br />Merlevede has achieved what I have not found in any other single text on EQ or NLP.  He presents NLP through the filters of real life experience and personal wisdom to bring the power of these processes to a much wider audience. The authors have provided an easy to follow, concrete and complete program on: Why EQ, What (is) EQ, How EQ and What if EQ (in what other environments can I utilise these skills). At last- the total package-that works!<br />The book is filled with the powerful tools of NLP laced with practical examples and metaphors that inspire. It acts as reference text for consultants, trainers, coaches, NLP practitioners, leaders, executives and individuals who simply want to be their best and begin to utilise more of their vast and untapped potential.	2002-05-30

Not for scientists themselves, who can easily find out that more than half the overblown statements in the book are well known old science ideas. But a deservice for the non-scientific reader, who may actually be infused by the mantra that science is just purely speculation, without actually experimentation or show-and-tell. <br />I can speculate as much as I want about any single model. In fact, if a model is Turing Complete, as a CA is well-known to be, any speculation can always be verified by my model! But science is about proving with experiments one's theories. Or at least showing some interesting predictions that can be made based on chosing the proposed model. But neither of them are present in the book. In fact, in the beginning of the book itself Wolfram warns the reader that scientists are non-believers and will try to destroy his idea.<br />So he is now in a comfortable place. He has a Turing machine, and can therefore adjust the model to explaining anything. He claims due to the nature of the model he can predict little (interesting, isn't that the decidability problem?), and that <BR>all scientists will atack him because what he believes is true. <BR>This is circular reasoning. <br />Fractals have shown us that simplicity generates complexity. Even caos models that can be run on hand calculators show that. Or a double pendulum. It is a very well-known result (shown in the 50s/60s) that the game of life is Turing complete (ie. can compute any function given an appropriate program). CA are also Turing complete, so where is the news? I can compute anything. Writing a CA that generates prime numbers amounts to finding the right &quot;program&quot;... <br />What is disappointing is that most claims are not based on any theory or verification. Let us say that he cannot really run lab experiments to check his ideas. Or even that is too early to predict any new pheonomenon based on his ideas. Well, the least he could do is to use the powerful tools of Complexity Theory (especially Kolmogorov complexity) to measure the complexity of the patterns generated by a CA. Or to at least have some results veryfying the behavior of his set of axioms ... Ok, provide with <BR>some useful examples on how to apply CA to important problems in bioscience, engineering, etc ... Not toy computing (!). <br />But what he cannot do is to use ideas from other people without giving them proper credit (ok, he puts a tiny side note) or just assume that arrogance, young academic brilliance, or money can justify science. When he claims that all the major revolutions happened like this, I would suggest him to take a look at the first writings of Newton, Gauss, Einstein, Von Neumman, etc ... His predecessors had ideas that revolutionized science, but they always provided results for the scrutiny of other scientists as well. Moreover, their models and ideas could be translated to verifiable statements or allowed new and interesting predictions.<br />Science is about communication as much as it is about ideas. If one cannot convince other people rationally of the validity of the ideas, and also verify such ideas through experiments (the true hallmark of a scientific theory is checking predictions against experiments) then he is not scientific. He is just creating a cult. Not even a religion, because that assumes that God is not oneself. And Wolfram is convinced he is some kind of <BR>superhero. Well, I finally understand the title of the book. A new kind of science is about follow-the-leader and do not question, have faith, because my ego is the answer you have been waiting (not even 42)...	2002-05-30
US	52009272	R24XITVJ5TX2W0	0871138344	570501457	The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History	Books	2	3	4	N	N	A Lazy Unmasking	I was very disappointed in this book, especially after hearing the author on National Public Radio.  I expected a much more detailed reporting of Robert Hanssen himself, with dates, times, etc. that would indicate the author had dug very deep and had gotten details from those involved with the case.  It became very clear to me about 1/3 of the way into the book, that Mr. Vise really wanted to write a book about the FBI and Louis Freeh, not Robert Hanssen.  Robert Hanssen was easy - just a sick, compartmentalizing person whose problems stemmed from parental abuse in childhood.  The complexity of the workings of the FBI and Louis Freeh's direction of the agency were by far more intriguing to the author, and I think he was chomping at the bit to do a book on that, but instead gave in to a more provocative character.<BR>Mr. Vise lost my respect very early on when he mishandled the details of an interview with Hanssen's mother, who apparently recalled Richard J. Daley as the mayor of Chicago in 1935.  This was an impossibility, as Daley was not elected mayor until 1955. It was clear to me that the author either misquoted Mrs. Hanssen, or Mrs. Hanssen's recollection was skewed.  If the latter, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter ought to have caught it and made a note.<BR>I found the three appendixes redundant and pretty unnecessary, especially the one detailing his Internet postings regarding his sexual fantasies.  Mr. Vise provided a rather clear description of that part of Mr. Hanssen's personality, making the appendix just more titillation.  The lack of footnotes was disturbing, and nowhere could I find any discussion of how he verified the accuracy of the reports of life within Opus Dei.<BR>By far, the most intriguing person in the whole book was Mrs. Bonnie Hanssen, and I would really have liked to have read more about what makes her tick, why for more than 20 years she stayed with a man she knew she could not trust. Just citing a strong Catholic faith does not explain it fully, nor adequately.	2002-05-28

I agree with the nay-sayers who state that most (if not all) of the information contained in this book cannot be verified by standard reference methodologies. To be fair to Drunvalo, he does recommend discarding any information presented that does not feel comfortable intuitively. Some readers apparently feel that this applies to most of the material presented. He does not profess to be a 'scientist' and in fact stated his rejection of that form of informational hierarchy. His writing style is thus easy to read, as if you are talking with a friend. There is a huge amount of information presented in this book, and it remains to be seen if it really 'true' or not! Still worth a read in my opinion. I have not read Volume II but will take a look at it when it becomes available.	2002-05-28

Temple's theory that an intelligent civilization from a planet orbiting Sirius visited a primitive Africian tribe makes for an interesting read. He presents his information well. His arguments are intelligent, but not easily verified. <br />The book would have been better enhanced by independent research (not under his control) and an objective presentation of the counter-arguments to his theory (Temple does not acknowledge the possiblity that he could be wrong). Another problem: Temple presents his theory and the supporting evidence during the first (interesting) part of the book, and after that he launches into his other ideas such as the long ago discounted idea of a Mars mountain carved to look like a human face or the idea that the hind quarters of the Sphinx represents a dog not a lion. (In reality, the hind quarters of the Sphinx, if not leonine, are probably that of a bull such that the four key quarters of the zodiac are represented: lion (Leo), man (Aquarius), bull (Tauras); wings now missing (Scorpio).<br />One thing that helps support Temple's theory is that the Dogon themselves appear to believe it, and they maintain that they have passed the wisdom of this visitation from space down from the ages. The book does not explore verifying to what extent we can ascertain that the Dogon are telling us the truth about this visitation and trying to answer why, after a visitation from space, the Dogon don't have other advanced knowledge besides that of the star Sirius. <br />Those criticisms aside, I think Temple may be onto something here and for that, this book is worth the read. Don't expect the kind of depth and research you'd get from Graham Hancock, but you can expect not to have to deal with anything as easy to refute as Sitchen. (For example, Sitchen postulates the existence of a civilization on a 12th planet with a 3600 year orbital period, but doesn't acknowledge that such a planet would cause orbital irregularities--not found--in the other planets or explain how life could exist on a planet with no external heat source or photosynthesis).	2002-05-27

Posner has a noted background as a debater, and his approach to facts steadfastly evades the wealth of verified data available on tis subject.<br />The case as presented by Posner begins with unconditional acceptance of the single-bullet theory, which was rejected by every government inquiry ever since the Warren Report, and refuses even to acknowledge the tome of evidence it cannot explain. <br />This is poor research, and readers are urged to seek out a copy of David Lifton's Best Evidence for the most honest and complete account to date.	2002-05-16

Yes, it has some great facts about some unknown missions of the silent service. Yes, it has technical data so we know the authors knew what they are talking about, or at least they repeat it well. But, how can we be sure it is not just fiction, how can we be sure the truth is right here, not out there.<BR>Sometimes, reading it feels like reading some submariner propaganda. Everything is biased favorably towards the submariners, unfavorably towards the CIA. I find this very suspicious. I guess the only way of really knowing was to be there. We, readers, must just accept it for cash.<BR>Best thing to do is to confront the facts with some other books on the subject, which I did, and yes some facts are verified, though through a different light. I recommend doing this if you want a bigger picture.<BR>One example is Project Jennifer. In the book it is described as a failure. But the crew of the expedition says it was a success (see their reviews), so who do you believe?<BR>Another annoyance is the \\"character's description\\". We want the facts, not the \\"dirty little secrets\\" of every sub commander. It is good for a novel or a film, not for a serious book on a VERY serious subject, that is not over, even with the \\"apparent\\" collapse of the Soviet Union.

The coverage on SOAP extensions is interesting.<br />However, going through the book has been very frustrating for the following reasons:<br />1) Code examples (on page 60, 154, 281, etc), instructions (on page 66, 77, etc), and notes (on page 79, 252, etc) failed on the Visual Studio.NET release version (also known as RTM - Release To Manufacturing). Looks like the book was based on VS.NET Beta. I wish the book had been up front by warning its readers. After all, people can no longer obtain VS.NET Beta.<br />2) Page 41 mentioned an URL for downloading the book's code samples. Thus, after encountering the first beta-related code error, I downloaded the online code samples. I was hoping that, after the book went to print, the code samples had been revised to work in the release version of VS.NET. But they were not! When I last checked on 10/May/2002, the errors were still in the online code samples.<br />3) Code samples (on page 60, 350, and 383) have syntax errors and therefore could not even compile in the way they were shown.<br />4) There are numerous text errors through out the book. The most glaring and incredible is the one in chapter 8. That chapter is supposed to examine the WSDL produced for code previously used in chapter 4 and 5. However, what was actually shown and commented on was the WSDL of code in chapter 2 and 3, not 4 and 5. What made the error even more confusing was the last paragraph on page 131. It said, &quot;You might be wondering how developerEstimate and developerEstimateResponse got added to the [WSDL] document when they were not part of the original Web Service you created in Chapter 4 and 5. The .NET framework's created them...&quot; For those who haven't read the book, &quot;developerEstimate&quot; was a Web Method in the Web Service created in chapter 2 and 3, but not in chapter 4 and 5. Chapter 4 and 5's Web Service does have a Web Method, but it iscalled &quot;CalculateEstimate&quot; on page 69.<br />5) It appears that not all of the recommended ways of doing things had been verified. For instance, chapter 19 recommended using WaitHandle.WaitAll in a Windows Form. But when the button2_Click code on page 315 was executed, Windows returned the error &quot;WaitAll for multiple handles on an STA thread is not supported.&quot; That was because .NET Windows Forms use native Win32 Windows Forms which use Single Thread Apartment(STA) model.	2002-05-11

This is the best book about the life of Calamity Jane that I have been able to find. This book may \\"only\\" be a fictional biography, but I found it a better, and in some ways a more accurate, portrayal of Calamity Jane than in other more scholarly works. <br />   First, physically, this book is LARGE. The cover is sturdy cardboard with a simple pen and ink sketch of Calamity Jane. But the book's dimensions are those of a full sized hardcover. And, at almost 700 pages in length, the book is quite thick. The reason I'm describing the book is to help explain why the book is as [as costly] as a hardcover.<br />   No other author has captured the spirit and character of Calamity Jane like this! The author starts with Calamity Jane's parents, and continues to Calamity Jane's funeral and burial next to Wild Bill Hickock. There is not a dull moment in this book. Calamity Jane's life and adventures are presented with a \\"you are there\\" realism. Yes, I believe the author did study Calamity Jane's historical life for years before writing this book. This is the only fictional biography I have come across that comes with an index of historical persons and a bibliography.<br />   Is the history perfect? No, I believe the author dwells too long on Calamity Jane's probable childhood and cuts shorts her known military \\"career\\". And, she seems to skip Calamity Jane's \\"last bow\\" as it were, namely the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, in 1901, where Calamity Jane was part of the show, at least for awhile. But I didn't expect perfection. Calamity Jane's life was rich, adventurous, and full of contradictions. The author herself states: \\"Of necessity, \\"Calamity\\" is a work of biographical fiction. Although a great deal has been written about Calamity Jane, the primary sources are so few and conflicting there's little about her life that can be verified.\\" But, that didn't stop the author from doing a great job.<br />   Why is a book this good so obscure? Part of it is the title.If the author had chosen the title \\"Calamity JANE 1851-1903\\" the book would pull up on the  ... search engine with the other Calamity Jane books. As such, I found the book by accident. Also, the book is [costly]. But, I feel this book was worth every penny I paid for it.<br />   I'm glad I found this book. I know one review won't raise the book out of obscurity. But, I felt the author deserved a good review, for an excellent book.	2002-04-29

Scientifically, Mr. Ford makes no mistake, as there are many antioxidants in wine (primarily anthocyanins extracted from tannin-rich reds); however, one cannot overlook that wine contains alcohol, a chemical which has been well-documented as toxic.  The French Paradox provides for very interesting reading, as it sheds an entirely new perspective on a long-examined indulgence.  Mr. Ford's words must be taken with a grain of salt; He is not providing a solution, rather just a fresh bout of information to supplant the nutrition experts.

Therefore I much appreciated the reviewers <BR>who provided their backgrounds, particularly the person who said that he (?) <BR>was already familiar with the latest concepts in physics, and that this <BR>book was not for such a person. I will say that I am not very familiar with <BR>a lot of modern physics, though I have read a lot on quantum physics and the <BR>supposed parallels with metaphysics. I have not studied relativity and E-mc2 <BR>quite enough to understand them, but this book helps a lot, at least with<BR>the latter.<br />    Overall I would give Ms. Cole a great deal of credit and appreciation<BR>for very clear, intuitive, even profound explanations of most of the topics <BR>covered in the book. She takes on some very hard concepts and makes <BR>them as understandable as just about any book on physics for the <BR>layperson I've read. As other reviewers have written, at times her <BR>fragmented writing style is annoying, but to me only when I don't care<BR>for the topic she is discussing, most particularly string theory. Yet <BR>the problem might not be with her explanations, but rather with anyone <BR>attempting to explain subjects that must require a multitude of assumptions <BR>and math that even Ph.D.'s would balk at to comprehend! I give the author<BR>a lot of credit for trying to teach the reader to do a kind of spatial <BR>thinking required to see the &quot;whole,&quot; by which I mean that science cannot <BR>stand alone, verified only by mathematical equations of &quot;objective&quot; reality. <BR>Clearly the reality of sub-atomic physics, for example, is weird and often <BR>inexplicable anyway.<br />    Ms.Cole lays a marvelous foundation for discussing how nothing has<br />become certain stage in particle physics. In the first chapter she<BR>tries to get the reader simply to ponder what nothing is. Nothing<BR>might be the number 0, or the supposed missing matter related to big<BR>bang cosmology, or the missing neutrinos from the sun, or even the potential <BR>force of gravity in motionless objects. Nothing is also the fact that all <BR>properties of matter emanate from &quot;nothing,&quot; which as she explains quite well <BR>throughout the book is the &quot;resurrection&quot; of the ether, which is called the <BR>quantum vacuum today. In this excellent first chapter and later the author <BR>reaffirms the unmistakeable parallels between the &quot;nothing&quot; in physics and the <BR>no-thing in Eastern religions like Buddhism, the idea that mystics perceive <BR>the ground that underlies all being, and that a person who wants to advance <BR>spiritually (and maybe in contemporary physics) must verse him/herself in the <BR>void to be open/aware of the big picture. This first chapter alone is like <BR>a book in itself becase of its wealth of ideas. <br />    My other favorite chapter by far is Chapter 4, &quot;Nothing Takes<BR>Center Stage.&quot; We learn that what was proven by Faraday and further<BR>substantiated by Einstein and other physicists is that nothing, the<BR>vaccum, spacetime, etc,, along with the fields that emanated from<BR>this nothing, is (to physics) *the* reality. One of the topic headings<BR>in this chapter is &quot;Matter As Metaphor&quot; - again, what counts is not<BR>particles but rather the fields that emanate from the particles and<BR>the spaces between them. I totally enjoyed her explanation of the<BR>particle-antiparticle phenomenom, which I had read before but didn't <BR>understand. On p. 82 is an excellent diagram of P. Dirac's explanation <BR>of how when a particle is created from nothing (the vacuum), there is <BR>a hole (anti-particle) created at the same time. When these two entities<BR>collide they destroy each other, given by E = 2 * mc2, since there<BR>are 2 particles. I feel Einstein's famous equation can be understood<BR>quite well from a careful read of this chapter.<br />    As I mentioned above I did not care for the chapter(s) on string<BR>theory. I cannot grasp the value of strings, which make protons look<BR>like planets (or larger), and exist in at least eleven dimensions.<BR>Until I do further reading on this topic I must wonder if physicists <BR>have taken the amazing discoveries of quantum physics too far in their <BR>reductionist quest for the ultimate &quot;nothing.&quot; And the author herself<BR>states that there is no one ground in current string theory.<BR> <BR>    The short bios and bibliography at the end are very commendable<BR>points to recommend the book, and show that the author has made a <BR>gallant attempt to summarize an amazing variety of books on physics <BR>and other disciplines that (she believes) are related to the topics <BR>she discusses.<br />    I really look forward to reading at least 3 books from the <BR>bibliogrpahy and returning to &quot;A Hole In The Universe&quot; to<BR>see how well the author aided my understanding of these topics.	2002-04-24

But if I am I hope to remember the words of the old play in which King Henry IV Part One does not wish to hear the word Mortimer, and change them apropos:<br /><br />\\"Nay, I will; that's flat:<br />He said he would not ransom Truth to Power;<br />Forbad my tongue to speak of 'Truth to Power';<br />But I will find him when he lies asleep,<br />And in his ear I'll holla 'Truth to Power!'<br />Nay,<br />I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak<br />Nothing but 'Truth to Power,' and give it him<br />To keep his anger still in motion.\\"<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br /><br />This book is deep nonsense, because it assumes without argument that public intellectuals participate in a \\"market.\\"<br /><br />The problem is that effective public intellectuals don't produce what Posner thinks they produce.<br /><br />The public intellectual's publisher, and not the public intellectual, produces the commodity, that more or less corresponds to the activity of the public intellectual.<br /><br />*Qua* public intellectual, George Orwell was an effective contributor to a conversation in which it was found that Stalinism and other forms of totalitarianism are dead ends.  It was his publisher that took his writings and made them into a saleable product.<br /><br />However, Posner has made it clear in other books that he believes we all participate in a hypostatized Market, and can and should be judged based on Market criteria.  His Market replaces outdated ideologies like the dictatorship of the proletariat, while refusing to admit that it is indeed another ideology.<br /><br />The problem is that if the \\"marketplace of ideas\\" is infinite in all directions, consisting of individual producers individually evaluated by atomized consumers, there is literally no way of telling whether the ideas, so marketed, are true or false.<br /><br />The phenomenon is apparent on the Internet; for in place of a libertarian fantasy-land, in which truth appears because all contributors are equal, and none of them receives special consideration because he represents an institution or a public intellectual, we have an almost daemonic world in which falsity is given equal credence with truth.<br /><br />Thus on the contemporary Internet, a 15-year-old kid who knows nothing about the law is prized as a legal authority because of the very structure of the Internet.  This structure provides no way of mapping authorities such that their views are certified by linkage to an authority outside cyberspace.<br /><br />Cass Sunstein has described this problem as that of the \\"discourse cascade\\" where entire zones of the Internet are dedicate to false propositions such as the importance of the Second Amendment.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Posner would destroy the institution of the public intellectual by treating the public intellectual as an employee who is found wanting in terms of a hypostatized Productivity of trueand verifiable (or not falsifiable, within a time frame Posner gets to specify) ideas.<br /><br />This is deeply dishonest, for Posner is concerned with deconstructing a priesthood.  The problem is that nature abhors a vacuum, and into the vacuum created by the absence of public intellectuals, rushes people like Posner who are public intellectuals, malgre lui.<br /><br />What Posner misses is that public intellectuals are not entrepreneurs producing a mousetrap.  Instead, they are participants in a conversation such that it is completely meaningless to rate their output.<br /><br />And note that despite Posner's faith in the Market, he mistrusts the real market.  For example, he probably thinks Adorno is nonsense, for Theodore Adorno was a Frankfurt School Marxist.  Nonetheless, the real market, in the form of computers at Borders and Barnes and Noble, keeps on putting the gloomy Tedster on the shelves, to be pawed by the grubby hands of us ordinary slobs, who are unconvinced that we live in the best of all possible worlds under the market.<br /><br />Here Posner replicates an intellectual's mistake, which is to find fault with the decisions of the real market, whether in the name of what the intellectual thinks Marx said, or, in the contemporary scene, what Milton Friedman and Sir Karl Popper said.  For in a fashion reminiscent of Turing, and Godel, the real market keeps its own deconstruction in print.<br /><br />Posner is mobilizing resentment against people perceived to be media figures and, since the ordinary educated person does not regard them as real, these public intellectuals can be targets of resentment.  When I worked at Princeton, I would occasionally encounter the public intellectual Cornel West, walking down Prospect towards William Street on my lunch break.<br /><br />Cornel was most engaging and approachable, and reading his output I view him less as a scientist making isolated predictions, than a man engaged in conversation with the past, and with issues of the present day.<br /><br />It is to me therefore ill-spirited to REDUCE Cornel, or anyone else, to a set of verifiable or falsifiable tokens printed in books,  and it is productive, in right-wing, mass media venues, of a new and very nasty phenomenon.<br /><br />This is the public intellectual *maudit*, like Anne Coulter, who when bested in debate makes physical threats, which can neither be verified nor falsified, conveniently enough.

Turkish guards sell Vergeen to an Arabic nomad, where for one year she is a Bedouin slave, tattooed on her forehead and chin as a sign of servitude.  Thanks to her own indomitable will and personality, Vergeen escapes and survives to start a new life in the United States, where she and her new family prosper.

Several reviewers have described this book as \\"believeable\\". This is problematic, as the author states clearly that the only tangible documentation that can support the myriad of claims made in the book have been either lost, sold, or usurped by the government. What we are left with is completely unverifiable.     Any one of us can write a book solving all of the unsolved mysteries from the last century, and then end it with:  \\"I can't prove anything I've said, because the government stole all the documents, and I can't tell you or prove who I am because it's too dangerous, but it's all true, really, take my word for it, I wouldn't tell a lie.\\"    I'd be just as excited as anyone to learn that the book was factual, but I just don't see it. If Jackie's identity, as well as the book's many claims, can be verified, I will gladly take back every single word. The book is pure fiction, until proven otherwise.	2002-04-23

Every true scientist cannot believe only mere extrapolations of modern theories (without experimental verifications). 'Virtual particles' which are such foundations for many Hawking's explanations cannot be even in principle observed in any experiment. Paradoxical (not conviencing) explanation that black holes must have their own gravitational field is also obvious lack of consistency. It contradicts its own definition that nothing can escape gravitational field of blackhole (even gravity). Hawking himself as well as other scientists were convincing themselves in those paradoxical explanations otherwise, they should partially abandon Einstein's theory or Quantum Mechanics. Do you think that a true approach can be based on some bogus or doubtful foundations (or predictions)?<br />As a matter of fact, our modern physics based on Relativity and Quantum mechanics remains essentially incomplete. In other words, these modern theories are only partially true (as any scientific knowledge) and only partially verified. So, every extrapolation of them cannot be so reliable as we would like. Only ignorant reader (who is fascinated by the first introduction into modern cosmology) can be so enthusiastic with this book (which is rather boring and, to be honest, is not so brillant in comparision with other writings for laymen).<br />Unfortunately, Hawking shows almost no doubt (as any true scientist should do) about the correctness of existing theories and so plays really negative role for scientific progress because any effort to complete our fundamental knowledge may be spoiled by the noise of enthusiastic apologets.<br />Thus, my conclusion is that the material and foundations provided for Hawking's book are rather bogus for present day to construct a reliable picture of surrounding Universe. I do not want it to happen but I am sure that this book will make our future generations smile while reading Hawking's book.<br />Eventually, physics will escape from the current dead-end and many of our present day conceptions will die for ever, as I am sure, will do 'virtual particles'.uture generations smile while reading Hawkings book.<BR>Eventually, physics will escape from the current dead-end and many of our present day conceptions will die for ever, as I am sure, will do 'virtual particles'.	2002-04-22

The house is performing to expectations.  We have had no problems over 3 years.<br />Before proceeding, our building plans were independantly verified by a mechanical contractor.  He found that the formulas presented in the book were accurate and dependable.<br />The concrete crib added about $3K to the overall cost of the house (it has a 25'x40' footprint) and the windows had to be specially ordered from Andersen.  We also had some trouble finding the 6 mil aluminized mylar. <br />The only departure we made from the plans presented was we decreased the amount of air exchange by 50% over what was recommended.  We used an outside air intake that funneled outside air into the crib and the bathroom vents (2) for exhaust.  We have had no problems with this.<br />I was fortunate to have found a contractor who was willing to take the time to understand the concept and then successfully build to the specifications.  A number of foundation contractors turned us down.  The contractor had to do the foundation himself.  It went very smoothly.<br />If you are serious about building this house, be sure to have very specific architectural plans for your builder....she/he will need them.

The third edition of Fullen's book - \\"The New Meaning of Educational Change\\" came out to the readers in 2001 ten years after its second edition was published. Its contents have been greatly enriched and \\"`the meaning hypothesis' has become deeply confirmed.\\" The \\"knowledge base\\" of change in this book is broadened and deepened by applying the advances of cognitive science and the chaos theory. Based upon this, the conclusion is made that \\"working on `coherence' is the key to dealing with the nonlinear fragmented demands of overloaded reform agendas\\". A variety of most recent research about educational innovations by Cohen, Elmore, Fullan, Hargreaves, Hatch, Oakes and other researchers are integrated into different chapters and themes. Some newly verified thoughts of educational change are also presented in the new book. For instance, \\"one of the keys to successful changes is the improvement of relationships-precisely the focus of group development,\\" \\"you can turn around an elementary school in about 3 years, a high school in 6 years, and a school district (depending on size) in about 8 years.\\" <br />The new edition maintains the key structure and context of its former editions. Part one is concerned with understanding the overview of educational change. Part two are designed to look at change at the local level. Part three deals with educational change at the regional and national levels. The book remains its focuses on understanding both the small and big pictures of change and maintains the theme of rendering complexity understandable and amendable to productive action. The author's in-depth insights about the contradictory and paradoxical nature of change and his illustrative and practical ideas about the procedures of change still greatly contributes to the values of the book. <br />If you want to equip yourself with the important, resourceful, and up-dated theory, research and practices about \\"what\\" and \\"how\\" of educational change, the third edition is your necessity.	2002-04-15

It is certainly well-suited for classroom use, and it includes computer exercises what are definitely helpful for those who need to develop actual computer code to solve the relevant equations of interest. Since it emphasizes the numerical solution of stochastic differential equations, the authors do not give the details behind the theory, but references are given for the interested reader.<br />As preparation for the study of SDEs, the authors detail some preliminary background on probability, statistics, and stochastic processes in Part 1 of the book. Particularly well-written is the discussion on random number generators and efficient methods for generating random numbers, such as the Box-Muller and Polar Marsaglia methods. Both discrete and continuous Markov processes are discussed, and the authors review the connection between Weiner processes (Brownian motion for the physicist reader) and white noise. The measure-theory foundations of the subject are outlined briefly for the interested reader.<br />Part 2 begins naturally with an overview of stochastic calculus, with the Ito calculus chosen to show how to generalize ordinary calculus to the stochastic realm. The authors motivate the subject as one in which the functional form of stochastic processes was emphasized, with Ito attempting to find out just when local properties such as the drift and diffusion coefficients can characterize the stochastic process. The Ito formula is shown to be a generalization of the chain rule of ordinary calculus to the case where stochasticity is present. The authors are also careful to distinguish between \\"random\\" differential equations and \\"stochastic\\" differential equations. The former can be solved by integrating over differentiable sample paths, but in the latter one has to face the nondifferentiability of the sample paths, and hence solutions are more difficult to obtain. The authors give many examples of SDEs that can be solved explicitly, and prove existence and uniqueness theorems for strong solutions of the SDEs. And since ordinary differential equations are usually tackled by Taylor series expansions, it is perhaps not surprising that this technique would be generalized to SDEs, which the authors do in detail in this part. They also outline the differences between the Ito and Stratonovich interpretations of stochastic integrals and SDEs.<br />Part 3 is definitely of great interest to those who must develop mathematical models using SDEs. The authors carefully outline the reasons where Ito versus the Stratonovich formulations are used, this being largely dependent on the degree of autocorrelation in the processes at hand. The Stratonovich SDE is recommended for cases when the white noise is used as an idealization of a (smooth) real noise process. The authors also show how to approximate Markov chain problems with diffusion processes, which are the solutions of Ito SDEs. Several very interesting examples are given of the applications of stochastic differential equations; the particular ones of direct interest to me were the ones on population dynamics, protein kinetics, and genetics; option pricing, and blood clotting dynamics/cellular energetics.<br />After a review of discrete time approzimations in ordinary deterministic differential equations, in part 4 the authors show to solve SDEs using this approximation. The familiar Euler approximation is considered, with a simple example having an explicit solution compared with its Euler approximate solution. They also show how to use simulations when an explicit solution is lacking. The importance notions of strong and weak convergence of  the approximate solutions are discussed in detail. Strong convergence is basically a convergence in norm (absolute value), while weak convergence is taken with respect to a collection of test functions. Both of these types of convergence reduce to the ordinary deterministic sense of convergence when the random elements are removed.<br />The discussion of convergence in part 4 leads to a very extensive discussion of strongly convergent approximations in part 5, and weakly convergent approximations in part 6. Stochastic Taylor expansions done with respect to the strong convergence criterion are discussed, beginning with the Euler approximation. More complicated strongly convergent stochastic approximation schemes are also considered, such as the Milstein scheme, which reduces to the Euler scheme when the diffusion coefficients only depend on time. The strong Taylor schemes of all orders are treated in detail. Since Taylor approximations make evaluations of the derivatives necessary, which is computational intensive, the authors discuss strong approximation schemes that do not require this, much like the Runge-Kutta methods in the deterministic case , but the authors are careful to point out that the Runge-Kutta analogy is problematic in the stochastic case. Several of  these \\"derivative-free\\" schemes are considered by the authors. The authors also consider implicit strong approximation schemes for stiff SDEs, wherein numerical instabilities are problematic. Interesting applications are given for strong approximations for SDEs, such as the Duffing-Van der Pol oscillator, which is very important system in engineering mechanics and phyics, and has been subjected to an incredible amount of research.<br />More detailed consideration of weak Taylor approximations is given in part 6. The Euler scheme is examined first in the weak approximation, with the higher-order schemes following. Since weak convergence is more stringent than strong convergence, it should come as no surprise that fewer terms are required to obtain convergence, as compared with strong convergence at the same order. This intuition is indeed verified in the discussion, and the authors treat both explicit and implicit weak approximations, along with extrapolation and predictor-corrector methods. And most importantly, the authors give an introduction to the Girsanov methods for variance reduction of weak approximations to Ito diffusions, along with other techniques for doing the same. Those readers involved in constructive quantum field theory will value the treatment on using weak approximations to calculate functional integrals. The approximation of Lyapunov exponents for stochastic dynamical systems is also treated, along with the approximation of invariant measures.ue), while weak convergence is taken with respect to a collection of test functions.

Mr. Osuna talked to surviving DeFeo members to get the inside details, reviewed official documents, and interviewed outside witnesses to get to the heart of the matter.<br />I have followed the Amityville subject since its inception, and have found most people interested in the matter to be open-minded and intelligent, eager to review all facts.  Sadly, there is also a small component of diehard believers who appear quite reluctant to let go of their indefensible conviction that the \\"Amityville Horror\\" was a true story, and so it should be said that they will probably not care a great deal for this book, or may perhaps even feel threatened by it.  Their reaction should be no surprise, however; they smeared Dr. Stephen Kaplan after he went public with the truth regarding the fallacies of this ghost story, and no doubt they will do the same in regards to Mr. Osuna's work (whether or not they have actually read it).  Hostile remarks without elaboration or specific examples that may appear throughout this book review section should be taken as merely a testimony to the efficacy as well as accuracy of Mr. Osuna's illimunating work.<br />For anyone who is interested in separating fantasy from fact, falsehoods from truths, and myth from reality, this book will please and entertaintremendously.	2002-04-10
US	47392054	R9DJ4FX72ESIJ	0684846675	111727190	A Corner of the Veil	Books	5	12	12	N	Y	A WONDERFUL, AFFIRMING (at least, for me) NOVEL	I read with interest -- and a chuckle -- the complaints of some reviewers about the 'humor' in this novel.  I found humor in abundance within its pages -- not the 'belly-laugh' sort of humor that we Americans have come to expect from TV sitcoms and films, but the 'wry smile' sort of humor that is more touching and subtle.  Cosse's writing is both humorous and meaningful -- but there is a lot more to this little book than humor.<br />Interestingly enough, the book I read just prior to picking up this novel was Simon Mawer's THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS, in which a priest deals with the discovery of an ancient scroll that has the potential to destroy his church, the message within being one that repudiates all that Christianity has stood upon for nearly two thousand years.  In A CORNER OF THE VEIL, the opposite occurs -- a manuscript is received by the Casuist order in France that proves, after hundreds of years and innumerable attempts by philosophers and thinkers, the irruftable existence of God.<br />It would seem that the church would look upon such a find as a victory of sorts -- everything they have been espousing over their history has been verified on paper, in terms that anyone can understand.  And while it is true that those who read the proof -- spiritual and secular people alike -- are touched by it on the deepest possible level and reduced to tears of joy, the proof brings sheer terror and panic to the hierarchy of the church and state.  Grim predictions are made that, if the proof is made public, it will mean the end of society as we know it, chaos, the end of the world.<br />The struggles and machinations the proof sets into motion are both humorous and thought-provoking.  Without giving away any more of the story, I will simply say that I felt the message to be one, not of revelation, but of affirmation.  The novel is not anti-religious in any form or fashion that I can see -- nor is it indoctrinarial in the least.  I found it to be intelligently conceived and written, a very compelling and moving work -- one which I can recommend heartily.written, a very compelling and moving work -- one which I can recommend heartily.	2002-04-09

I really like the idea of having a &quot;Rush Encyclpedia,&quot;  but I like more the idea of having a &quot;100 % CORRECT Rush Encyclopedia&quot;!<br />A minor disagreement with &quot;Bearcat Fan&quot; from Ohio (below)... this book DOES have many typographical errors, but the issue that Rush fans have with &quot;Mereley Players&quot; (sic) isn't these simple typos; it's the errors of FACT.  Given that this book will be used for many years as an &quot;encyclopedia of all things Rush,&quot; and as a reference source for debating Rush-related arcana, the on-line Rush community feels it would be nice if the information within was entirely correct.  It's not, and that's our primary beef with the tome.<br />Efforts have been made by a handful of Rush fans (myself included) to gather all the factual errors found in the book, and collectively print these mistakes on-line as &quot;Merely Errata.&quot;  Perhaps in future editions of this encyclopedia, corrections will be made. <br />A personal beef: as someone who's essentially gathered and compiled a large amount of previously-available Rush-themed material, shouldn't Robert Telleria be credited as the &quot;editor&quot; of this book, and not the author?  <br />Another thing: I find a lack of depth in Telleria's  interpretations of Rush songs.  Telleria should leave the &quot;lyrical analysis&quot; stuff to Carol Selby Price, who wrote an outstanding (and scholarly) book on the subject - &quot;Mystic Rhythms: The Philosophical Vision of Rush.&quot;<br />As an obsessive fan of the band for some 20 years, I really didn't find much in this book that I didn't already know. Throughout the &quot;Biography&quot; section that begins the book, the author often gives us quotes from Rush interviews as supporting material for the various statements he makes.  Of the handful of informational tidbits which struck me as &quot;new&quot; (or &quot;things about Rush that I didn't already know&quot;), NONE of these items were followed by a supporting quote from Rush or their associates. &quot;Where,&quot; I asked myself, &quot;did the author find this information?  Is it accurate?&quot;  Because Robert Telleria doesn't cite the source of these statements, and because these statements aren't verified by a quote from the band, I believe this information to be suspect.  Perhaps these &quot;facts&quot; came from the author's own imagination (e.g. Neil Peart appears on the PERMANENT WAVES album cover), or perhaps he's printing as fact things that he once heard as rumour (e.g. Rush was asked to participate in Woodstock 1994, to appear on SNL, and to be featured on VH1's &quot;Behind the Music,&quot; but declined each time).  <br />It'd be nice to know where Robert Telleria learned these &quot;facts,&quot; and to know whether the source of this information is credible.  In the meantime, I can't blindly accept these statements as truth... I've found too many other instances in the book where I know the author is wrong. <br />This tome could've been so much more.  Hopefully there will be future editions of &quot;Merely Players&quot; that are more accurate; editions that deserve more the title of &quot;Rush Encyclopedia.&quot;	2002-04-08

Her drug use served to intensify her emotional problems, distorted her personality, ruined her career, and ultimately took her life.  These are facts, and any Garland biography that attempts to gloss over them does a disservice to its subject, who deserves the dignity of truth.  But Sheridan Morley and Ruth Leon's JUDY GARLAND: BEYOND THE RAINBOW does not simply meet these facts, it turns them into superficial tabloid trash complete with pat explantions and superficial interpretations; worse still, the text is riddled with factual inaccuracy, relies upon rumor and mean-spirited speculation, and makes no attempt to place Garland's difficulties in perspective with the other aspects of her life.<br />I can think of no other Garland text, including the absolutely abominable biography by Anne Edwards, that so ill-serves its own subject.  It is filled with unverified and self-serving gossip delivered in such a nasty tone that one wonders how Morley and Leon manage to sleep at night.  If you wish to read a legitimate portrait of Garland, I recommend you seek out Christopher Finch's meticulously researched and elegantly written RAINBOW: THE STORMY LIFE OF JUDY GARLAND (sadly, now out of print) or Gerald Frank's exhaustive JUDY instead--and avoid this piece of coffee table trash as you would the plague.	2002-04-03
US	52665839	R36A6B3LY9BFU4	0385506198	869666762	The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton	Books	2	16	37	N	N	The Clinton Presidency Is Still Misunderstood	Despite promising something new with the subtitle of the book, \\"The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton,\\" Joe Klein's theme is familiar. He believes Clinton was the most talented politician of the latter part of the Twentieth Century,  but that his personal excesses disappointed  his supporters and provided  opponents with the ammunition they hoped to use to destroy him. The American people, who in Klein's story are alternatively indolent and endowed with great common sense (depending on what point the author is trying to make on any given page) save the day by recognizing that Clinton was, for all his faults, better than his enemies.  <br />Klein's method is to give the appearance of  balance by deploring Clinton's well known personal weaknesses, while rendering a selective history of the presidency that inflates its substance. <br />The author is in awe of Clinton's grasp of the details of domestic policy, but aside from his assertion that Clinton was responsible for the Federal budget surpluses of the late 1990s (which, as I will discuss below, is largely a myth), he doesn't adequately address whether Clinton, the policy wonk, had the judgment to separate forest from trees. He glides over Clinton's ignorance of foreign policy, even going so far as to relegate to parentheses an aside that Clinton's \\"handling of national security issues remained sketchy and uncertain.\\" <br />In his account of impeachment, Klein is eloquent in his silence concerning Clinton's perjury and obstruction of justice. To Klein, impeachment was about sex, pure and simple. In his words, Clinton was a \\"rogue,\\"  but not a \\"scoundrel.\\" <br />The Constitution delegates to the House the authority to define an impeachable offense and to the Senate the determination of whether the offense justifies removal of a president. Future events may or may not confirm the wisdom of the decision that perjury and obstruction of justice do not meet the constitutional standards for conviction, but the Senate was clear in its acquittal of President Clinton. <br />Nevertheless, Klein is disingenuous in implying that Congress acted improperly in bringing those charges to an impeachment trial. Whatever the merits of the Paula Jones case, the actions for which Clinton was impeached were clearly undertaken to deprive her of a fair court hearing. If the American experiment has any meaning, it is that those who are granted government sanctioned power must be prevented from riding roughshod over the powerless. Congress would have been irresponsible had it not formally considered whether Clinton's abuse of power warranted removal from office.<br />One can agree that Clinton should not have been convicted by the Senate and still understand that his crimes were not lacking in gravity. Klein's cavalier dismissal of  the affair as a mere sex scandal reeks of cynicism.<br />On the economy, Klein credits Clinton with producing a balanced budget, and he accepts Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's theory that balanced budgets are the fundamental variable leading to lower interest rates and economic recovery. <br />The facts do not support him.<br />Klein tries to show that Clinton pursued fiscal discipline from the beginning in 1993. He quotes Mrs. Clinton as telling him that the President understood the importance of deficit reduction from the start. <br />Perhaps. But then why doesn't Klein address the often quoted story that Clinton became furious with his economic advisors when they explained to him that his plans for expansive spending policy would jeopardize a recovery? \\"You mean the bond market dictates to the government?\\" he reportedly screamed.<br />Klein's claims for Clinton's fiscal restraint would be far more persuasive had he rebutted this famous story. Instead, his silence speaks volumes.  <br />At any rate Klein implies that Clinton's 1993 budget maneuvers were a success. In fact, Clinton's budget was regarded much like Bush's 1990 effort: a combination of higher taxes andsmoke and mirrors which did not make much headway in eliminating the chronic budget deficits. No one foresaw progress toward a balanced budget unless difficult political choices were finally confronted. Even at the end of his first term, Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal year 1997 predicted a balanced budget only by 2002. By 1996 fiscal plans which claimed to produce surpluses five years hence were no longer taken seriously.   <br />Conveniently picking  up the story in 1997, Klein implies that Clinton's negotiations on that year's Balanced Budget Agreement ushered in a new era of fiscal responsibility. In fact the 1997 act represented a retreat from serious budget decisions as both the White House and the Congress gave a sigh of relief on finding that a massive, and entirely unanticipated, economic boom had increased revenues to such an extent that deficit worries were (for the time being) a thing of the past.<br />Both Clinton and Congress then took credit for surpluses that neither created.<br />What about Rubin's theory that deficit reduction leads to lower interest rates and thus to a boom? The fact is, long term interest rates stood at 6.9 percent in late 1993, when Clinton's first budget was passed. They were at 7.2 percent when his presidency ended.<br />Deficits fell; interest rates fluctuated. Rubin's theory, which Klein accepts as fact, was not verified by empirical evidence.<br />Does this mean that Clinton (and Rubin) were poor economic stewards ? Of course not. Is fiscal discipline important? Without question. But is Klein's narrative accurate? No. <br />A less partisan and more factual economic history of the 1990s would read as follows: A relatively conservative Democratic president, prevented from sliding into excess by a nasty, but prudent, Republican Congress, presided over a glorious boom when both branches of government, restrained by the deficit, were forced to keep their hands off the marvelously productive American economy.<br />The heroin this account isn't Clinton, or the Republicans, it's the American economy and that much maligned villain, gridlock.<br />That's not the story you'll read in \\"The Natural.\\" One suspects that Klein's curiously selective history of the Clinton years is really less an honest evaluation of the presidency than an attempt to make it conform to the author's own view of the world.	2002-04-02

I have been dreading this review for a few days now.<br />Good stuff first.  <br />I learned an aweful lot about quantum physics and in particular particle physics in this book.  Many of the mysteries about what happens in those huge particle accelerators are revealed, and many of the theories which they support and spawn are truly amazing.  For example, do you know what two particles are release when a proton and an anti proton colide? (the answer is two photons)  Did you know if you turn a graphic displaying this reaction on its side it implies that a photon and a proton can generate a photon and an antiproton?  Pretty cool stuff.<br />I was also quite pleased to really understand the distinction between Special and General relativity; thanks Al.  Furthermore, I was amazed to learn that Bohr was possibly the actual founder of quantum physics way back in 1900 I think (and I just thought he was that guy that made that electron shells model of the atom.)<br />Unfortunately, there is lots of bad stuff.<br />Some of the charts are absolutely unintelligible, and at times it seems the text meant to describe those charts may actually be referring to a different book entirely.  Not good.<br />There are some huge leaps of logic, especially near the end where he discusses Bell's theorem.  One in particular left me livid.  We are told to believe all things are connected (non-locality of space) based on an experiment that the author never says has been verified.  Another explanation is mentioned but cast off, particles moving at superluminal velocities.<br />And finaly, the frequent injection of, \\"just like Eastern philosophy has been saying for a gazillion years\\" is just plain annoying.  Zen can be a useful for understanding what cognition and perception are, but as a tool for understanding subatomic physics it is just plain ridiculous.  \\"Our world is what we percieve it to be,\\" is fine when you are talking about the mind, but falling back on it to explain away the wave-particle duality of light is a cop out.  The answers may be \\"inside the watch case we can never open\\" as Einstein said, but those answers are there.  A light wave does not \\"choose\\" to go through one slot or the other because I saw it do it.<br />The most important statement in the book is in a footnote.  Paraphrased it says, \\"The current state of sub-atomic physics is analogous to the Ptolomeaic (spelling?) world of Astronomy before Copernicus.\\"  It seems likely to me that the subatomic equivalent of \\"the earth is not the center of the universe\\" could take these bizzare particle behaviors we see and make perfect sense of them.<br />If our answers are bewildering, it can only mean that our premise, and therefore our questions, are the ones that are flawed.	2002-03-29

The Crusades are  blamed for everything wrong between Muslims and Christians.  Of course, not only does this fuel the flames, it completely overlooks the Muslim invasion of Europe long before the Crusades.  This is a fact almost never mentioned in the anti-Christian diatribe.  If it had not been for Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, all of Europe might be Muslim today, and the diatribe may well be anti-Muslim.  The truth is, Islam was spread by the sword.  Why is it that this is rarely mentioned?  Even in the public school history books it may only be given a paragraph.  Islamic history is often \\"revisionist\\" and full of lies, as is all history.  Muslims not only took slaves, but they deny slavery, even though they used slaves to fight for them.      It seems that in today's \\"Political Correctness\\" anything can be said about Christians, no matter how ugly the statement, but if one little statement is misconstrued about Muslim, or other religions, then that person is labled a \\"Bigot\\"?    If you don't think Karen Armstrong is a nut case, then look at this newspaper article and see what Islam is really like.     Iraq al-Qaida says pope, West are doomed By ANNA JOHNSON,      CAIRO, Egypt - An al-Qaida-linked extremist group warned        Pope Benedict XVI on Monday that he and the West were \\"doomed,\\" as protesters raged across the Muslim world to demand more of an apology from the pontiff for his remarks about Islam and violence.      The Mujahedeen Shura Council, an umbrella organization of Sunni Arab extremist groups that includes al-Qaida in Iraq, issued a statement on a Web forum vowing to continue its holy war against the West. The authenticity of the statement could not be independently verified.    The group said Muslims wouldbe victorious and addressed the pope as \\"the worshipper of the cross\\" saying \\"you and the West are doomed as you can see from the defeat in Iraq,        Afghanistan,Chechnya and elsewhere. ... We will break up the cross, spill the liquor and impose head tax, then the only thing acceptable is a conversion (to Islam) or (killed by) the sword.\\"    Islam forbids drinking alcohol and requires non-Muslims to pay a head tax to safeguard their lives if conquered by Muslims. They are exempt if they convert to Islam.    In Indian-controlled Kashmir, meanwhile, shops, businesses and schools shut down in response to a strike call by the head of a hard-line Muslim separatist leader to denounce Benedict. For the third day running, people burned tires and shouted \\"Down with the pope.\\"    Protests also broke out in Iraq, where angry demonstrators burned an effigy of the pope in Basra, and in Indonesia, where more than 100 people rallied in front of the heavily guarded        Vatican Embassy in Jakarta, waving banners that said the \\"Pope is building religion on hatred.\\"    The pope on Sunday said he was \\"deeply sorry\\" about the angry reaction to his speech last week in which he cited the words of a Byzantine emperor who characterized some of the teachings of Islam's Prophet Muhammad as \\"evil and inhuman\\" and referred to spreading Islam \\"by the sword.\\"    Benedict said the remarks came from a text that didn't reflect his own opinion.    \\"I hope that this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address, which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with great mutual respect,\\" he said during his weekly appearance before pilgrims in Italy.    The statement of regret -- the pope's second in two days -- helped ease some tensions.    In Turkey, where outrage against Benedict's remarks had been swift, Catholic bishops decided Monday that no changes were necessary in his upcoming visit in November -- his first to a Muslim country, Vatican spokesman George Marovic said.    Marovic said the trip was expected to go on as planned, and the bishops had discussed the details of a religious ceremony the pontiff is to lead in Istanbul.    However, State Minister Mehmet Aydin, who oversees the religious affairs in Turkey, said he expected Turkish authorities to cancel the visit if Benedict does not offer a full apology.    \\"We are expecting the authorities to unilaterally cancel this visit. The pope's coming to Turkey isn't going to foment the uniting of civilizations, but a clash of civilizations,\\" he said.    The secretary-general of the Turkish HUKUK-DER law association submitted a request to the Justice Ministry asking that the pope be arrested upon entering Turkey.    The appeal by Fikret Karabekmez, a former legislator for the banned pro-Islamic Welfare Party, called for Benedict to be tried under several Turkish laws, among them obstruction of freedom of belief, encouraging discrimination based on religion, and inciting religious hatred.    A prosecutor in the ministry will evaluate the request and decide whether to open a case.    Angry reactions also persisted in other corners of the Muslim world, where many demanded more of an apology by the pope than Sunday's statement of regret.     \\"Muslims have all this while felt oppressed, and the statement by the pope saying he is sorry about the angry reaction is inadequate to calm the anger -- more so because he is the highest leader of the Vatican,\\" Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said.     More than 200 Muslims staged a sit-in at a shrine in Damascus,  Syria, heeding a call by the Damascus office of Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A statement issued by the office urged the pope to \\"openly and plainly apologize for his remarks.\\"     Protesters also rallied in the city of Muzaffarabad, in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. \\"His apology is not sufficient because he did not say that what he said was wrong,\\" said Uzair Ahmedof Pasban-e-Hurriyat, a Pakistani political group.     Morocco's King Mohammed VI sent a letter to the Vatican in which he implored Benedict to show \\"the same respect for Islam that you have for the other religions,\\" Moroccan media reported. Morocco withdrew its ambassador to the Vatican over the weekend.     Even in China, where the government exerts tight controls over religious activities, a top religious official said Benedict had insulted the nation's Muslims.     \\"This has gravely hurt the feelings of the Muslims across the world, including those from China,\\" Chen Guangyuan, president of Islamic Association of China, was quoted as saying in an interview with the Xinhua news agency.     In the Middle East, where Muslims threw firebombs at seven churches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the weekend, Christian leaders posted guards outside some churches.     \\"We are afraid,\\" said Sonia Kobatazi, a Christian Lebanese, after Mass at the Maronite Christian St. George Cathedral in Beirut, Lebanon, where about a dozen policemen carrying automatic weapons stood guard.   ___     Associated Press writers Maamoun Youssef in Cairo, Aijaz Hussain in Srinigar, India, Benjamin Harvey in Istanbul, Turkey, and Slobodan Lekic in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed to this report.  ------------------------------------------------------------  Don't for one minute think that it's just a few extremists. Those extremists are supported by millions of other Muslims. This is not to say Islam is bad and all Muslims are bad; but there are enough extremists to make the world a sad place at this time in history.	2002-03-28

It has been a long four years in the world of philosphical discussion about chess, since John Watson came out with his epic Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy.  Watson's book is a comprehensive look at the elements of chess, as they have evolved since the time of Nimzowitsch.  His book is based on the premise that the old masters were incorrect in thinking that chess is based on rules, which more or less dictate the strategy and tactics to be applied in a game.  I have always thought that Watson's book is a travesty in terms of its logical argument.  It is a great chess book, due to the depth of its discussion, on both an historical and a substantive level, but his whole philosophical argument about the nature of chess is ridiculous.  The whole argument that evaluation of a position must be based on concrete analysis rather than the application of rules is a truism in one sense, and false in another.  In any field of knowledge, there are general rules or principles.  For instance, when driving a car (in the USA), there is the rule that you should pass on the left.  But if there is a snow plow traveling at 5 mph in the left lane, the \\"concrete analysis\\" dictates that you should pass on the right.  Similar to this argument, Watson presents old rules such as \\"don't move a piece twice in the opening,\\" and then presents specific examples to show that a player did the right thing by moving a piece twice in the opening. This is so Mickey-Mouse and simple an argument that it is amazing that Watson's book has received the acclaim it has.  However, the present book, Excelling at Chess, is the first systematic attempt at refuting Watson's argument.  Aagard likes Watson's book (as does everyone apparently), but he points out that general rules of positional understanding do often dicate the correct strategy to follow in a game, even though of course any ideas must be verified by concrete analysis.  This is obviously true, and it is refreshing to hear someone say it.  There is no question that Watson went way overboard with his arguments.  The Aagard book is an excellent, entertaining read that is full of insights into chess, what makes a great player, the competitive aspect of playing chess and improving, and many other issues.  It is everything I love in a chess book.  If you like The Seven Deadly Chess Sins, Watson's book, The Road to Chess Improvement, and that type of book, you will like this one too.  In summary, highly recommended: a refreshing and challenging book.question that Watson went way overboard with his arguments.

Unlike the books by Ed Decker and the Tanners, this one isn't a detailed in-depth analysis of Mormonism vs. Biblical Christianity, but instead, is the story of the author's investigation into Mormonism, and how too many things just didn't add up... like how the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;, which was written by Joseph Smith and considered by Mormonism to be without error, keeps getting revised, and many more things like this.  The author does provide plenty of facts that can be verified by anyone interested in the Truth.  The author is very gentle in this book, and is kind to Mormons while at the same time exposing the many deceptions of Mormonism which most Mormons don't even know about.  I would not classify it as an anti-Mormon book, but as a pro-Truth book which exposes errors in Mormon doctrine.  I do hope Zondervan will re-print it... it is in my opinion _THE_ classic on this subject, and needs to be read by all Mormons and non-Mormons alike.	2002-03-18

Read this book!	I guess the best way I can put this is that I respectfully disagree with the respected Pathologist and the other fellow who claims this was a good &quot;story&quot;.<br />The truth is that in my experience as a hypnotherapist past lives are real. This book offers compelling evidence for the phenomenon but there are many other books that do so as well. I simply like Dr. Weiss's presentation.<br />Those who left negative reviews seem to not realize a simple principle regarding subjective experience. That principle is that all subjective experience is translated through the subconscious before it can be percieved or vocalized by the subject therefore there can be some confusing or disjointed perceptions. Subjective experience is just that, subjective experience. Sometimes it can be proven with evidence found in the objective world; such as historical observations that can be confirmed.<br />In other cases, these experiences cannot be verified because there are no references available. In these cases the reality of the experience will be its effect upon the subject. If the experience was transformative then it is fundamentally &quot;real&quot; for the person involved. These types of cases aren't able to be proven. That doesn't mean it didn't happen.<br />I have no doubt that those who gave negative reviews have beliefs that are less than 100% grounded in reason and proof such as God/Jesus/Buddha/Allah/Krishna or any Higher Power by whatever name or an afterlife. There is at least as much &quot;proof&quot; for the existance of past lives as there proof of God(s) or an afterlife. So before you scoff consider that we all hold beliefs (well 99% of us at least) that are gounded in a reality beyond that which we can perceive with the senses. I'm not talking about resurrections and parting red seas I am talking about that which we can experience, not in simple faith which can be likened to continuing to believe in Santa well into adulthood. You may believe but that belief is largely baseless. <br />Plus, the soul/mind/spirit has its own wisdom beyond the physical brain. It is that perception that allows us to perceive that which cannot be empirically proven. I love science, but my religion isn't materialism and sometimes we can become blinded by &quot;reason&quot; to truths beyond the scientific method.<br />Chris	2002-03-17

I read this book back in the late 70's, while in high school.  Almost a decade later, I read a letter to the editor stating that what I believed was nonsense and that evolutionary theory was based on sound scientific principles--listing six basic tenets of evolution that could be verified from science.  I had a real crisis of faith.  If scientific facts verified that what I believed wasn't true, I didn't want to go on thinking that way just because someone else did.  I resolved that I would look at the evidence that evolutionists had to present, weigh it carefully, and prepare myself to somehow alter my worldview.  I spent hours scouring books and journals at our fairly large downtown public library (already my favorite place!).  I read books by evolutionists specifically written about this issue.  I read the relevant sections of college science textbooks.  I searched the periodicals indexes.  I spent hours upon hours intensely searching all the literature that I could find there.  The more that I read, the more that I realized that evolutionists did not have any scientific evidence for these basic six tenets of evolution (or any basic tenets).  Many of the evolutionists just came right out and admitted that there was no real evidence in the area of their specialty.  Others simply filled the space with rhetoric and presuppositions, but no citings of great scientific discoveries or detailed experimental studies to support their views.  Now when I hear the old line that evolutionists freely throw around about creationism being &quot;bad science,&quot; I just say &quot;Hey!  If you've got evidence for evolution, please show me.&quot;  So far, no one seems to remember where this great storehouse of scientific evidence for evolution is hidden.  Whenever they try to dig it up, all they have to share is rhetoric (or sometimes scientific evidence that has nothing to do with the issue, such as for variation within a created kind, which any modern creationist believes in).  As one who has earned (with honors) both a B.A. and M.Div. for studies in Bible and Theology, I can say with confidence that the negative reviewers of this book are ignorant of what Genesis really says and how it has really been interpreted throughout church history. (They quote exceptions but are ignorant of the rule.)  They also seem to be ignorant of the views of scientists before Charles Darwin and even a minority of real scientists since then.  And again as usual they make broad generalizations about creationism but provide no evidence to back it up.  This book on the other hand is packed from front to back with cited scientific evidence in support of Morris' views--not just rhetoric.  Sure it's biased!  But let's at least be honest....So are the evolutionists!  Bias doesn't mean unscientific, or there could not be science (except on the planet Vulcan, of course).  Morris does what any good scientist does.  He presents his hypothesis and seeks to support it with evidence.  A good scientist will discard his hypothesis whenever the evidence is clearly against it.  A good evolutionist, however, just keeps dreaming up a new theory that is beyond our present state of scientific knowledge.  That's why evolutionists no longer look for gradual change displayed in the fossil record, but now claim that these many changes all happened too fast to be recorded in the fossil record.  Hmmm.  And many other examples could be given,.....but I just looked at the clock and it's way past my bedtime!  Final thought:  Find out what the real issues are.  Look at the actual facts.  Don't be swayed by simple rhetoric and opinion--even if it seems to be a majority or someone with a lot of letters behind their name.  I've found that neither can be relied on for finding the truth.

This is an excellent book, one which should be on the shelf of every American home and which should be taught in every school.  It sheds light on how an immoral, hate-filled man can manipulate the U.S. political system for his own gain.  Once released, Timmerman's book \\"Shakedown\\" instantly shot to the top of the Amazon.com sales list, and rightfully so.  Many Americans have long suspected that Jesse Jackson was not just the glib, rotund, 'rhyming 'n' rapping' religious figure and civil rights activist he tries to portray himself as.  Timmerman shows that Jackson has long used the mantle of civil rights to camouflage his own fraudulent schemes and to distract public attention from his scandals.  In the process, Timmerman also shows how the Democratic Party enabled and cheered Jackson on, using him as a racial attack dog for their own corrupt ends.  This is a truly fascinating book, and is well worth both the price and the time required to read it.   <br />As A Black man, I've always been disgusted by the hypocritical, racist antics of Jesse Jackson Sr.  Unmistakably, this vicious scam artist has done more to set back race relations in the United States than the KKK ever dreamed of.  Kenneth Timmerman finally shines the light of truth and clarity on this scheming, conniving con man, and meticulously details his numerous, unbelievable crimes and outrages.  Timmerman has extensively footnoted and verified his research, so there will be no way Jesse Jackson or the usual Democratic Party character assassins can deny this, although they'll try.  The most pressing question I had after reading Timmerman's factual reporting was, \\"Why on Earth isn't Jesse Jackson now serving a 'natural-life' sentence in prison somewhere, for multiple convictions on extortion, racketeering, fraud and tax evasion charges?\\"  Hopefully, the U.S. Justice Department will read this book as well and feel compelled to finally indict Jackson.  As Timmerman clearly shows in Chapters 2 through 8, there'splenty there for the Feds to go after.<br />Timmerman gets it all absolutely correct.  Jackson has supported the insane idea of reparations for Blacks, has been a cheerleader for Black crime, has thrown tantrums whenever a Black person was mistreated, but completely ignored numerous events where Blacks injured or killed Whites.  He has extorted various US businesses, incited riots, and has done everything except backflips to get his face on television at every conceivable opportunity.  He \\"counseled\\" Bill Clinton on adultery while his pregnant mistress sat outside the Oval Office.<br />I hope Timmerman is prepared for the attempts the extremist Left will make to ruin his career and destroy him personally.  They simply can't stand up to the stark reality which Timmerman lays out in his book.  Kenneth Timmerman has done us all a valuable service by showing us the truth.  I predict that this book will be a profitable best-seller for Amazon.com, as well as a text that will be cited and quoted for years to come.  There's not much new in this book, as Rush Limbaugh, black columnist Walter Williams, and black radio host Larry Elder have been commenting on Jesse Jackson's misdeeds and lies for years.  However, nobody else has come close to presenting the truth about Jackson so clearly, convincingly, and succinctly as Timmerman.  It's a definite \\"gotta have\\" - buy it today at Amazon.com.  You won't be able to put it down.  Highly recommended!	2002-03-10

I could see the scenes in my mind, that is how good the writing is.  I was inspired by this book.  She brought to me the story of Mark, cousin of one the beginning giants of the Church, and helped me to see that it could be my story.  I went back to the Bible and read again the part in Acts about Mark leaving Paul &amp; Barnabas, Paul &amp; Barnabas going seperate ways because of it, and then, in his 2nd letter to Timothy, Paul asking for Mark to come to him because he is a comfort to Paul.  If God can work in his life, Mrs. Traylor helped me to see that He could and wants to work in my life.  Mark is a novel that kept me turning pages.  After reading so many of her works, I have faith in her faithfulness to the Scriptures.  She is also faithful to the cultures of the characters she writes about.  Many times I have come across references in her books that have been verified by other resources.  The same is true of Mark.  Get this book and sit back and let her tell you an amazing story.  I think that you will be inspired by it like I was.	2002-03-07

There is no possibility of giving zero stars ... so I give one star for sheer dubiousness. The whole book is filled with highly speculative stories and straight out inaccuracies. I have concentrated on the chapter on Otto Skorzeny (since I recently wrote a short biography on him) and his supposed discovery of the Ark et al. near Montsgur, but very little in this chapter could be verified. Skorzeny never was near the region during that time, let alone finding any Cathar treasure. Buechners sources are also very badly chosen and I have written to the author asking for better reference some time ago. Unsurprisingly I received no answer. This book is great late night or travelling trash reading, read it like a rollercoaster science fiction novel, but don't forget, the Nazis did not discover the Grail. However, one really has to wonder, why Dr. Buechner, who supposedly was the first doctor to attend to the liberated inmates of Dachau concentration camp, had to wait 36 years to come up with this bogus story about Skorzeny and the Nazis as Grailfinders. Avoid, if you are looking for historical data.	2002-03-07

To some it means a re-examination of long held historical INTERPRETATION, to others it refers to an assault on &quot;deified&quot; truths. Facts can usually be (though not always) verified through the historical record (i.e. statisitcs, census, casualty tabulations etc.) - so there can be little room for argument. Fine - unfortunately Dr. Lipstadt doesn't stop here and soils her arguments with venomous, personal attacks - calling her opponents (or anyone who dares question or investigate)  &quot;fascists.&quot;  How convenient and easy a way to squelch dissent and debate, and I concur with a previous reviewer concerning her view that those whom dare to question should not be allowed any forum to respond to her charges of &quot;fascism&quot; and &quot;racism.&quot;  Scholarly dissention, disagreement, and debunking is fine and part of the academic method -- but name calling, vilifiying, and campaigns of personal destruction in the name of an agenda [no matter how noble in intent] - is dangerous. Is Dr. Lipstadt writing as an historian or activist?

That Castaneda died an old,<BR>frail man when the books promised an extraordinarily long and healthy life seemed to give lie to his words, but in fact this<BR>does not take away from the philosophical beauty of works like<BR>\\"Tales Of Power\\", which is my favorite of the six I have read<BR>so far (there are ten in all).<br />The first book, \\"The Teachings Of Don Juan\\", is easily the<BR>slightest--although it introduces the saga and provides the reader with some of the terminology, it is clear that Castaneda<BR>had yet to grasp what was happening to him, and much of it is (as he later admits) a strange cross between far-fetched prose and overly-analytical text.  \\"A Separate Reality\\" is a vast improvement, even as the stories get wilder and wilder; some readers have howled with laughter over tales of invisible 'allies' which guard the sorcerer, or of an astral <BR>\\"yoke\\" which can give a man superhuman powers, but the imagery<BR>is extraordinary and the philosophical lessons behind such<BR>truly bizarre events are unique and important. <br />The third book, \\"Journey To Ixtlan\\", is the easiest to swallow for most people, since it concentrates on the self-help and ethical aspects of the teaching and keeps the wild stories to a bare minimum (as such, it is highly recommended).  However, \\"Tales Of Power\\" picks up where \\"A Separate Reality\\" left off and ups the ante on both the crazy events (at one point Castaneda is teleported in time and space) and the overall<BR>philosphical arc of the series, for it is in this volume that the all-important ideas of the 'tonal' and 'nagual' are introduced, discussed and exhibited.  Although the concepts may sound like a souped-up version of Sartre-styled existentialism (anyone remember \\"Nausea\\"?) and Zen, there is nothing wrong with <BR>this and, in fact, by presenting the ideas in these new terms<BR>he makes them sound fresh and arguably easier to understand.  His characterizations of Don Juan and Don Genaro are as meticulous as ever, and both men emerge in the book as spiritual <BR>masters of a most peculiar order.  Even if neither ever existed,<BR>or if Casteneda made every word up out of thin air (and he didn't--researchers have verified his trips to Mexico on these<BR>dates), it doesn't matter--the wisdom you will receive from these books is priceless.	2002-03-01

It contains authentic elements of Italian folklore and folk magic, mixed with various aspects of Italian Witchcraft.  But as the author clearly states in the introduction, portions of the material are also mixed with some modern Wiccan elements.  I found very little of this mixture, but it is present as the author readily admits several places in this book.<br />Grimassi states in the introduction that he created a system called the Aridian Tradition for Americans to practice, which is a blend of old and new material. There are two chapters dealing with the modern Aridian Tradition, chapters three and twelve. The remaining 20 chapters all contain older and authentic Italian material, much of it verified by the field research of several folklorists, including J.B. Andrews, Lady de Vere, Roma Lister, and Charles Leland.<br />For some additional background reading on Italian Witchcraft and folklore, I would suggest The Evil Eye by Elsworthy, and Etruscan Roman Remains by Charles Leland.	2002-03-01

In point of fact, DNA evidence was inconclusive, but Ellis presented that questionable matter as FACT in an otherwise enjoyable book. The problem with notable historians presenting falsehoods as fact is that those lies become self-perpetuating. Ellis ought to know better.<br />I enjoyed his analysis of the duel. He effectively managed to present the context as to who actually witnessed the duel and whose story held water and whose did not. As to what the participants were thinking, Ellis did cover some possibilities, but not without reason and insight. Especially where the events cannot entirely verified, it's important to look at context to figure out what likely happened. A different person might come up with different possibilities, but that's why you don't rely on just one perspective.<br />I haven't finished the book yet, but I am enjoying it. One thing I find about books like this is that they are useful to everyone, but not always comprehensive for the serious scholar. They are invitations to do more research for those who have an interest, but otherwise a pleasant trip reading interesting stories. People will get what they want out of it, but I wouldn't discount it solely because of Ellis' previous indescretions.	2002-02-28

I easily completed this book within one afternoon. Though it has a typical amount of pages, the comic-like format turns the read into a swift breeze filled with humor and creativity. It begins with explaining why Descartes is the father of modern philosophy, namely that he thought for himself (in a departure from Scholasticism). Though he retained Christian belief throughout his life, he was a very rational and mathematically minded person in the field of science that he managed to keep secular in practice, though it would ultimately be verified on God the Geometer's grounds. Aside from his biography, this Cartesian exordium lays out the philosophy of mind and all of the perspectives on it. (dual aspect monism, occasionalism, epiphenomenalism, materialism, functionalism, behaviourism, cognitivism and pyschophysical parallelism--for some more recent takes on the ghost in the machine I recommend Colin Mcginn's \\"The Mysterious Flame\\") Inevitably these talks bring up the issue of artificial intelligence and conscious automata.<BR>Obviously like any other book in the \\"Introducing\\" series this book is simple, general, and fun, but at the same time comprehensive and a great starting point.	2002-02-25

What sporadic critical thought is found in these pages amounts to a mere couple chapters in competing books in this genre. The manner in which the authors completely ignore or gloss over both significant relevant issues and glaring holes in their personal favorite theories, which they put forth on nearly every topic, continually presenting opinion as scientific fact, is frustratingly irritating.    Of particular note, the authors' somewhat whiney complaining about what they view as undeserved popularity garnered by Fingerprints of the Gods is a CONSTANT theme and is unpleasantly reminiscent of Howard Cosells infantile rants about retired professionals being allowed to commentate on the sports they mastered. While Fingerprints was clearly submitted as something of a thought experiment by a journalist, this book was presented as an unbiased scholarly appraoch (yet this books authors spend so much type complaining that it comes of as an obsessive negative review of Hancocks book). The authors' near disgust that anyone could actually find Hancocks book entertaining is omnipresent. Fingerprints was put forth by a journalist who made no qualms about clearly expressing interpretation and opinion as such and tried to lead the reader through a journey of layman investigation of entertaining questions. This book, however fails miserably at being the scholarly contemplative effort it claims to be. Indeed, it clearly does not even attempt to be that, but merely declared that it would in the course of CONTINUAL fallacies which permeate the book (I am a mathematician and I wouldn't care to count the times the authors commit \\"poisoning of the well\\" alone).    Time and again the authors speak of convential science views as if they are necessarily what they present them as, which they often are not, and are gospel. The repetitive diatribe in which they constantly preach orthodoxy is severely abrasive to anyone who reads the book for an unbiased viewpoint. Despite the promise to present facts and let the reader decide, they continually slap the reader in the face with their personal opinions; ending nearly every idea with a declaration of their favored perspective as fact or at least portraying it as if it is the only possible sensible interpretation, despite a theme of absense of fact in the ideas they clearly attempt to send to the \\"head of the class\\".     The tiresome theme of bashing Hancocks book is so continuous that it becomes nauseating; I wouldn't keep bringing this up, but I realized it would be completely necessary to do so in any truthful review around page 230....when the authors were STILL harping about Hancocks book. This book was NOT advertised as being an editorial reply to that book and I was frankly quite irritated to see it was exactly that.    Theories which are contrary to their desires are dismissed, much as a child unreasoningly repeats the mantra of \\"I don' wanna!\\".     They mention, in one perfectly characteristic instance, 6 facts about the Minoan Atlantis hypothesis which supposedly debunk it absolutely:               1) They mention that the volcanic explosion of Thera is inconsistent with tidal wave and earthquake effects, which is actually a poor estimate of the destructive powers of a tremendous volcanic explosion on a nearby island (a hallmark of the inadaquacies of scholarship of the authors work in this book is their riding the fence on Plato; they use his writings to supposedly \\"prove\\" their favored ideas, and selectively attribute many other of his writings to fantasy). Thier portrayal of the explosion of Thera is so completely uninformed that one can only wonder how someone could defend them in presenting it.               2 & 3) They mention 2 things which are actually archaelogically verified and speak for the Minoan Hypothesis, but say these facts are insignificant because they each occurred in some other locations as well.               4) The authors make one of their characteristically incredulous remarks in proposing that Platos account lacking bull-leaping games, one of the many sports of Minos, somehow goes towards providing an incongruity!               5) They out-of-hand dismiss ALL other possible parallels without addressing or even presenting them; calling them collectively \\"too weak to merit discussion\\" (despite that being what the authors FALSELY put forth as this books purpose)!               6) Lastly, they attempt to say that the Minoan theory \\"completely collapses\\" when you consider that it's 'factor of 10' lemma can't be applied universally, despite the fact that it was explicitly not to be used for those (mostly indirect) applications. The authors then go on to completely omit ALL size and chronology information from their hard-sell of their pet viewpoint (except, inexplicably, a couple dates that they haven't contemplated enough to realize CANNOT be made to fit the model of Plato that they pick and choose from so freely; like an unruly child they leave the portions which are unsavory to them)!     Thus throughout thier entire argument, there is not one valid point speaking against the minoan hypothesis and a number of things which speak for it. Thus, there is no justification for thier conclusions. Yet, as is typical for them, they go on to put forth thier favored theory as fact, speaking down to any reader who has noticed that there is no support for thier conclusions in thier writings. Their free exchange of distict mythological entities in this article is typical: the par for their course being at once particularly irresponsible, humorous and frustrating.     I feel that the Minoan Atlantis hypothesis, and indeed all specific Atlantis hypotheses, are without any abundance of substance; but given the authors declared subject matter for this book (which indeed is a false declaration), the scholastic irresponsibility and selective ignorance of fact, used to promote personal opinion throughout, are sophomoric and reprehensible.    While I rarely put pen to a bad review, I felt compelled to warn readers that this book is poor remedial journalism in scholarly clothing. A journalistic approach is perfectly viable when presented as such, to put forth something seething with bias as impartial academic investigation is pick-pocketing. The aggresive hard-sell agenda grates strongly on the impartial reader. The childish arguments used, including calling anyone who questions certain of thier ideas \\"racists\\" out-of-hand (! I do not know anyone can defend a book which does this and portrays itself as scholarly !) and continual use of logical fallacies, are enough to insult the intelligence of any reader who tries to approach the topics of discussion without walking in step with the bias of the authors.    Pass on this one, there are plenty of books written on these topics, some legitimately scholarly, some more open-minded, which deal with the ancient mysteries herein without treating the reader to a manifesto of slant.    -true__ibnFrey  :)      *** edit: elucidation forced by above reviews ***    Reviews are supposed to address the product, not make failed flailing attempts to attack another reviewer while avoiding the fact that thier comments are unbiased and truthful. My comments centered on the lack of scholarship in the book, so saying I feel like the book is \\"blasphemy\\" only shows that you either did not read my review or did not understand it. What I said is fact and someone attacking me for taking exception at an author calling anyone who doesn't agree with them: \\"racists\\" does not retroactively remove that comment from thier book. Niether does it remove the method of presenting thier favored ideas as fact from nearly every topic. Nor does it, though some mystical convection, convey consistency upon the fallacious arguments used throughout the book.    It has been 3 yearsand there is not one point I made that anyone can contend with. The authors arguments do not hold up under any scrutiny whatsoever. Please examine what I wrote above about thier supposed dubunking of the Minoan hypothesis (one which I do not particularly subscribe to myself, though most scholars who do try to place an Atlantis do so in the Minoan empire); not one point they made holds up under any scrutiny. They continually write on a topic as if what they are saying is the only legitimate way to look at it, despite thier stated goal of pursuing a \\"middle course\\". Once one sees that thier argument on a topic contains no merit, it becomes a waxing task to continue to the next topic, which is simply more of the same from these authors.     This book is not scholarly and isn't even legitimately journalistic. It is a hard-sell of particular ideas of the authors, which is exactly what it was advertised as not being. I understand many people are used to just going along with what someone makes \\"sound good\\", but thier \\"arguments\\" fall apart exactly as thier \\"argument\\" against the Minoan Atlantis hypothesis did (see above); indeed they are not attempts at legitimate argument but attempts to to use compositional content to sway and when necessary berate the reader into the authors favored views (views they say they won't put into the book but are nonetheless omnipresent).     There are a lot of books in this genre and this one simply does not measure up. To get what most people are looking for when they look at this book (i.e. an impartial scholarly approach), and not a bunch of fallacious arguments which will fall apart and make you look like a fool in front of anyone who's read anything scholarly on the topic, try \\"THE SEVENTY GREAT MYSTERIES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD\\" Fagan, et al. For a cursory examination of ancient civilizations, albiet not centered on mysteries exclusively, try BBCs \\"Civilizations: Ten Thousand Years of Ancient History\\" Macintosh & Twist. For particular mysteries, try scholarly works such as \\"Noah's Flood\\" Ryan & Pittman, but save yourself time, money and face by avoiding this pulp promotion of the precept \\"Sapientia, delenda est!\\" (Ceterum censeo Sapientia esse delendam. -- James/Thorpe)       I don' wanna say \\"I told ya so\\", but that's the point I'd like to make ;)    GL HFA :D  -true__ibnFrey	2002-02-23

The new book \\"Face on the Pacific Floor\\" by Lloyd Stewart Carpenter is one of the most thought provoking books I've seen in<BR>quite a while.

I am not totally convinced of his interpretation of several of the other images, but the reader is free to<BR>offer suggestions to Mr. Carpenter for his next release.

Get ready for the worst!!!\\"<BR>The author is unknown. <br />In his book \\" The Art of the Long View\\" Peter Schwartz very convincingly demonstrates the necessity of future planning.  His main point is that \\"Art\\" can and must be trained.  All his evidence has been gathered from his many years work experience by working as a consultant for Royal Dutch/Shell Company and later as a director for the Global Business Network organization. <BR>The book starts with Schwartz's analyses of the scenario building, for the Smith & Hawken company in the late seventies when the company faced a dilemma of how to plan business: as a retail company or a mail order company.   All points he brings out especially interesting for me because at present I am working in retail company myself.  The author suggests that the best way to plan for the future is to try to build scenarios  - specially constructed stories about the future, where each scenario represents a distinct, plausible world. He analyzes that scenario  \\"often (but not always) seems to fall into three groups: more of the same, but better; worse (decay and depression); and different but better (fundamental changes) (p.19)\\".  Through the book, however, the author continually emphasizes that reality will most likely be the combination of all three scenarios. The \\"Art\\" is to make yourself believe in an alternative future and to think about what can be done differently now either to prevent it from happening later or the opposite - to make something happen.   In order not to become overwhelmed with different prognoses of the future, I have found Schwartz's example of understanding what optimism is especially important: \\"having enough challenges to give life meaning\\" (p.74).   In other words, only by learning to overcome difficulties people can become successful and can fulfill their abilities.  <BR>  Through the book the author analyzes the economic problems in the seventies such as the oil crisis and challenges that Royal Dutch/Shell Company had to face at that time.  He stated that the scenario method considerably helped the company with strategy planning.  However, the Schwartz argues that the main key to success has been the ability of managers to come to mutual understanding of the problems that the company could face in the future.  Schwartz underlines the idea that the success of decision-making process depends on the manager's ability to see the big picture and to apply it to the specific problem.  Thus, the main part of the scenario building process is gathering information.  He introduces readers to such criteria as driven forces, predetermined elements, and critical uncertainties as the key factors to scenario building.  He states that all these elements have an enormous influence on economical, political, technological, environmental situation in the world and on the society as a whole.  Therefore, the author states that keeping track of new developments in science and technology should be the focus of the futurist's research.   <BR>  Schwartz made an important contribution by suggesting and discussing new driven forces of the future as what he calls \\" The Global Teenager\\".  Schwartz indicates that at the present time there are about two billion teenagers in the world, most of which live in third world countries.  These countries do not have many business opportunities, whereas in industrial countries the population of teens is dropping. In order to survive, teens will have to immigrate all over the world.  At the same time industrial countries will not accept them unless they are educated enough. Therefore, the whole future relies on education.  As computers will become more affordable, more teens will communicate with other teens around the world and will want to travel and learn more.  However, the author noticed that how countries will handle immigration remains a critical uncertainty.  But it is inevitable that management in all industrial countrieswill have to deal with even more cultural diversity and will have to face a great deal of learning to come to mutual understanding.  <BR>This book made me think about something I have never thought before.  I think the author made a strong point in showing that a good scenario leads to many new questions and it is an ongoing learning process.   Thus, the book will be especially interesting managers, decision makers and to all people who study business planning and communication, but I would also recommend it for general reading. Indeed, I believed that the book teaches important principals of critical thinking that is in great demand in our high competitive reality.  My reading of the book suggests that Schwartz's verified with many examples that future cannot be predetermined and that the main point of scenario building is to train yourself to look for details that can lead to unexpected changes.  However, you have to plan in advance if you want to have enough time to prepare yourself for any uncertainty in the future.   After reading this book I feel like I finally grow up.  Importance of the subject makes me change my perceptions of view on certain thinks I did not want to consider before in my personal life.	2002-02-18

He claims that the only contemporary evidence for the Taj being built by Shah Jahan lies in Tavernier's book. This is a wilful deception. The official chronicles of Shah Jahan's reign, four of them, all mention the building of the Taj after the death of Mumtaz Mahal. Abdul Hamid Lahori, the official court historian, minutely describes the building of the monument from the foundations up. Subsequent Persian histories list the names of artisans employed for the task. It is true that LAND was taken from Jai Singh, but he was compensated for the land with four mansions.<BR>The great love between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz is also clearly described in the Shahjahannama: about how some of Shah Jahan's hair turned white after her death; how he did not appear in public for a week; how he visited her first grave in Burhanpur and read the opening chapter of the Quran; how he made it a point to visit the Taj every year on her death anniversary.<BR>I have tried to track down the Marvin Miller (sometimes referred to as Marvin Mills) who is supposed to have carbon dated a door from the Taj. It is claimed that he teaches at a leading design institute. I have verified that no Marvin Miller or Marvin Mills is, or ever has been, a member of the faculty of the Pratt Institute.<BR>The Taj uses an inlay technique called pietra dura, which only came to India with florentine visitors in the late sixteenth century, so the question of the Taj being built earlier does not arise.<BR>Oak cannot decide if the Taj is supposed to be a Rajput Palace, as he first argued, or a Shiva temple, as he now claims. It looks neither like a Hindu temple, nor a Rajput palace, nor a temple palace. No Hindu temples or palaces ever had domes or minarets, nor symmetrical gardens.<BR>If you are one of those Hindus who believes that his religious pride depends on dismissing or appropriating every Indian Muslim achievement, then this is the book for you. Nothing I can say will convince you otherwise. But if you are open-minded, I can assure you that the arguments of this book are specious and dangerous, part of a concerted effort by the Hindu Right to spread their poisonous agenda.	2002-02-18

I'm fairly inured to horror and to the stories of other infamous murderers, but Zodiac really gives me the spooks.  The story of Zodiac's attack on a young couple at Lake Berryessa is one of the most chilling things I have ever read--the stranger approaches, disappears, reappears wearing a black hood, converses with the youngsters, ties them up, then calmly and coolly says \\"I'm going to have to stab you people,\\" and then goes about doing just that.  I would rather meet up with Ted Bundy or Jack the Ripper than I would Zodiac.  I was initially worried about the author's presentation because he included a lot of unimportant details about events occurring before the time of the murders and made comments like the air was \\"exhilarating\\" on a particular day--things he couldn't have known and which don't matter at all anyway.  However, he quickly settled in to a gripping narrative of events, and his own work on the case was presented fairly well and reveals to us the shifting thoughts and theories he had about the case and the perpetrator who was never caught.<br />Graysmith tells a good story, but his opinions on the case can be questioned.  Also, I have to mention the fact that he was the editorial cartoonist of the San Francisco chronicle at the time and not an investigative journalist.  I know this fact should not lead me to discount his conclusions, but it does make me wonder how he came to get as much access to this case as he did.  The enigmatic ciphers the killer sent to the newspapers represent unique additions to an already mystifying series of murders, and this book published much of this material for the first time.  The longest cipher was eventually cracked by the author; although it was verified by experts as correct, I myself did not feel 100% confident about every detail of the solution.  In this and some other matters, the author seemed to make jumps that I could not fully justify; with countless suggestions and theories surrounding this case, it was sometimes difficult to see why Graysmith subscribed to one but not another.  When he lists details about other possible Zodiac victims, he leaves the waters pretty murky.  His remarks about astrological aspects and the moon perhaps determining the dates of Zodiac's actions are interesting but too vague in description for me to fully consider valid.<br />I first read this book several years ago, and I have recently seen allusions to the fact that Graysmith named the killer in this book.  I did not remember him doing that, so I finally decided to re-read the book now.  He does identify a suspect (pseudonymously) whom he believes to most likely be the Zodiac killer, but he has nothing beyond circumstantial evidence with which to \\"convict\\" the man.  In the years since this book was published, facts have arisen which essentially exonerate this individual of the crimes.  Thus, you will not find out who Zodiac was in these pages, but you will find a riveting story about one of the most infamous mass murderers in history.  Graysmith's efforts are sincere and to be respected, but they cannot be accepted without a critical eye toward the evidence that has accumulated in the years since this book's publication.h countless suggestions and theories surrounding this case, it was sometimes difficult to see why Graysmith subscribed to one but not another.

It is very entertaining, to say the least, and does contain some insights.  All of people in the book are easily described like cartoon characters in terms of their outer motives, their inner motives and their subconscious needs.  <br />It parallels other interesting works such as Machiavelli's &quot;The Prince&quot; and scores of ancient writings in philosophy in that its conclusions are based on 99% argument and 1% evidence.  Largely, this is because it is based on arbitrary, unverified models of human behavior.<br />I honestly believe that Robert Greene has mostly tried to make a compelling work of art here.  Most of his assertions are not supported with scientific evidence or even balanced historical evidence.  The book reads like a religious text, filled with unquestioned assertions.  There are no qualifying statements about the content of the book whatsoever; there are no statements that document the certainty of the &quot;truths&quot; in the book based on the strength of evidence.  Everything in the book is flatly stated.  The text itself is written like a documentary about society narrated by an amoral, omniscient deity whose words reflect a potent combination of all of the described techniques of seduction<br />In this way, the book is a self-referencing paradox.  It deceives you into understanding that you are being deceived.	2002-02-16

Alan Chalmers wrote this book (first published in 1976) because there was no suitable introductory text for undergraduate studies in the history and philosophy of science. The preliminary chapters are devoted to a close scrutiny and demolition of the old orthodoxy in the pre-Popperian philosophy of science, an orthodoxy still nurtured by admirers of the late David Stove.  Anything Goes by David Stove is supposed to be a weapon in the battle against the barbarians of deconstructionism but if Chalmers and Popper are on the right track, then turning to Stove and the inductivists for help is like fighting fire with petrol. It can be argued that the long domination of the logical positivists in the philosophy of science created such a mess (and a boring mess to boot) that many students were driven into the sociology of science or to the more radical camp of the deconstructionists.<br />Chalmers notes the common belief that the authority of science depends on the way that it \\"is derived from the facts\\".  However, as many research students discover when they turn from the bench to start writing up their results, it is very misleading to hope that accumulated observations will turn into general principles or theories (or a thesis). Still, scientific theories are supposed to be based on facts and confirmed by facts, and for a long time the official scientific method was an alleged process of induction, whereby scientific knowledge starts with the unbiased observation of the regularities which exist in the world around us and is finally warranted or verified by inductive proof. Chalmers explains with meticulous care how and why inductive verification and warranting does not work. Moreover he explains that it is not necessary to account for the growth or rationality of scientific knowledge.<br />One of the problems with the observational origin of theories is the abstract nature of advanced scientific theories. Electrons, wave currents and force fields are simply not accessible to observation, nor are the principles of natural selection or the laws of supply and demand. Equally embarrassing is the logical problem of induction. However many black ravens you observe, there is no way to prove that all ravens (in the universe) are black.<br />Popper's contribution to advance the debate was a revamped version of the hypothetico-deductive method foreshadowed by Jevons, Whewell, Pierce and the French physiologist Bernard.  He argued that knowledge advances by a problem-oriented process of conjecture, followed by rigorous testing of tentative solutions. Then we may select the best among the competing theories by its ability to survive the process of testing, or for its convenience if it is to be used for engineering calculations, or for its fertility if it is to used to inspire further research.  Falsified theories need not be discarded because they may stage a revival, they may have instrumental value and they may persist as components of a larger structure.<br />Popper's ideas were unfortunately labeled \\"falsificationism\\" because they were  advanced in the 1930s as a rejoinder to the logical positivists who wanted to use factual verification as a criterion of meaning. The \\"falsificationism\\" label was unfortunate and very misleading. As Popper recognized, there are problems with experimental or observational testing which preclude logically decisive falsifications. When other people noticed these problems, they claimed that this \\"falsified\\" Popper's theory of knowledge and scientific method.  This is not the case, because Popper's theory is more appropriately called \\"the non-authoritarian theory of knowledge\\" (because there is no ultimate authority) or \\"conjectural objective knowledge\\" (in contrast with the traditional quest for justified beliefs). But still, the impossibility of obtaining decisive falsifications was used by critics as the rationale to prematurely eliminate Popper from the main game in the 1970s.  This was partly due to the raging success of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions which captured the sociological spirit of the age with a beguiling account of the diffusion of intellectual innovations in the scientific community.<br />One of the most valuable sections of this book is the scrutiny of Kuhn and here Chalmers identifies profound ambiguity. Kuhn insists that there is evolutionary progress in science, on the other it is hard to reconcile this view with the `gestalt switching' process that is supposed to occur as people move from one paradigm to the next. Chalmers points out that the \\"gestalt switching' and the notion of incommensurability of paradigms can be put aside if one makes some fairly uncontroversial assumptions about the objectivity of scientific theories. In a previous publication, Science and its Fabrication, Chalmers has argued in a similar vein against the strong proponents of the sociology of science.<br />Turning to Lakatos, with his notion of a \\"hard core\\" of a research program which has to be protected from falsification by deflecting criticism to other \\"non core\\" elements of the program, Chalmers finds that there is no satisfactory guide to the selection of theories to be protected from the rigors of criticism. The radical views of Feyerabend are carefully dissected and Chalmers concedes that there are probably no universal and timeless standards in the philosophy of science. However this is not a concession that \\"anything goes\\" because it simply mirrors the situation in science itself.<br />This book can be recommended for anyone who wants to obtain a firmer grasp of science and its rationale. The  writing style is clear, engaging and unpretentious. The book is packed with episodes from the history of science so that there is a great deal to be learned about science itself in addition to the philosophical lessons that Chalmers has to convey. The major deficiency in the book is the inadequate characterization of Popper as a \\"falsificationist\\" and the neglect of Popper's theory of metaphysical research programs which appeared in the third volume of his \\"Postscript to the Logic of Scientific Discovery\\" in 1982.raging success of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions which captured the sociological spirit of the age with a beguiling account of the diffusion of intellectual innovations in the scientific community. <br />One of the most valuable sections of this book is the scrutiny of Kuhn and here Chalmers identifies profound ambiguity.

Rather than having to plow through all the Readings, searching for tidbits of interest, his book allows the reader to pick a topic and go straight to it.  He has done an excellent job of commenting on the Readings in ways that add insights into what, at times, can be the archaic language used by Cayce when in a trance.  <br />James has combined the Readings in ways that create commentaries on topics such as a new world view, Christian spirituality, spiritual laws, abundant life, reincarnation, healing, and much more.

Today I finally managed to gather<BR>up enough curiosity to find out what is so great about<BR>this author. So I surfed on over to Amazon.com where<BR>I knew they sometimes offered pages of excerpts from<BR>books, and sure enough, Bennett's \\"Kant's Analytic\\"<BR>was there to be perused just as if I were in a real book<BR>store cracking open real books and sampling the<BR>treats waiting inside the covers.<br />So far I am finding that Bennett's treatment of Kant<BR>borders on the disdainful. You will find him pooh-poohing<BR>the Transcendental Aesthetic as a minor work that<BR>Kant makes too much out of: \\"Considered as a source<BR>of cogent, detailed argument from true premisses to<BR>interesting conclusions, the Aesthetic is not impressive\\" (4).<BR>Nevertheless, Bennett declares that is necessary to<BR>pay attention to the Aesthetic because it is \\"required<BR>for an understanding of the *more mature and fruitful*<BR>parts of the Critique.\\" (Emphasis mine.)<br />Bennett's argument can be dealt with on so many levels<BR>that it is hard to know exactly where to begin, and at<BR>the same time build a coherent counterpoint. I often<BR>encounter this problem when I come across a criticism<BR>that is so off the mark about Kant that it requires a<BR>whole restructuring of the person's intellectuality from<BR>the foundations on up. Interestingly, this is exactly how<BR>Kant proceeds in the work in question, from the foundations<BR>of our intellect to the highest apex of reason. And so if<BR>someone like Bennett fails to grasp the significance of<BR>the Aesthetic, the foundation of our very intellectual<BR>knowledge, then all I can do is throw my hands up in<BR>the air and recommend that he start all over again from<BR>scratch.<br />What exactly has Bennett missed in the Aesthetic? Kant's total<BR>reversal of the Newtonian metaphysics of time and space<BR>which had held sway during that time and which had<BR>led to extremes of metaphysical skepticism and dogmatism.<BR>The key is in distinguishing transcendental realism from<BR>transcendental idealism. Realism holds that space and<BR>time are real entities whose function is to contain all the<BR>objects of the universe. Unfortunately, this makes space<BR>and time \\"more real\\" than the reality of our experience,<BR>and implies a metaphysics in which reality is constructed<BR>in dream-like fashion from basic unproven postulates, and<BR>an epistemology in which our knowledge of things becomes,<BR>at best, a confused representation of some \\"true reality\\" lying<BR>just out of reach of our experience. It is to place science and<BR>its inductive proofs in the place of common experience, and<BR>since science is ever-changing and hypothetical, with theories<BR>that are merely established over time through evidential<BR>reasoning often only to be knocked down again, then our very<BR>direct experiences of reality that we take for granted everyday<BR>are then to be categorized in the same hypothetical light. But is<BR>the computer monitor in front of you a mere hypothesis, or at<BR>best a theory that was established over time and is generally<BR>accepted by your cultural community? Kant would say, \\"No.\\"<br />Kant's Aesthetic (small as it may be in comparison to the rest<BR>of the Critique) is significant in thoroughly overturning such<BR>unfortunate results of Newtonian metaphysics. It may be<BR>poorly written, who knows? It may be badly argued. It does<BR>not really start out well, I'll grant that much at least. But I don't<BR>know which interpretation Bennett was working with, or if<BR>he was translating the original German. Just recently on<BR>another group I found myself arguing with somebody who<BR>took issue with a paragraph in the Aesthetic, and my<BR>solution was merely to bring in my own translation which<BR>had removed a key ambiguity in the text. (Thank you,<BR>Pluhar.) Bennett offers no textual support for his criticisms,<BR>so the reader is left with the belief that there is only one<BR>truth about Kant's Aesthetic, and that is Bennett's.<BR>Fortunately, this is far from the case.<br />Next, Bennett takes issue with a very basic concept<BR>in Kant's metaphysics, and that is the analytic-synthetic<BR>distinction. He attacks this distinction in propositions on<BR>two or three fronts. After giving a brief overview of Kant's<BR>own meaning of the terms (without, however, explaining<BR>why it was a significant distinction for Kant to make), Bennett<BR>places it in terms analogous to \\"tennis-racquets.\\" We<BR>should not, according to Bennett, distinguish between<BR>\\"the 'tennis-racquet' is right-handed\\" and \\"the 'tennis-racquet'<BR>is left-handed\\" because all \\"tennis-racquets\\" are the same.<BR>There are, however, differences between left- and right-<BR>handed golf clubs. The distinction, declares Bennett, is<BR>therefore contingent, either customary or utile, but not<BR>necessary.<br />Bennett then imagines Kant's counterpoint to be something<BR>along the lines that it is a distinction in judgments, not between<BR>mere propositions in general. He then develops a counterpoint<BR>to this imaginary point. Ho hum. I sincerely doubt that Bennett<BR>has any idea what a true Kantian counterpoint would be.<br />On the second main front, Bennett attacks Kant's distinction<BR>in propositions by means of self-contradictory statements<BR>such as \\"all squares are circular.\\" He asks, rhetorically, is this<BR>statement analytic or synthetic? But the reason that there is no<BR>answer this question and therefore must be considered a<BR>significant attack on Kant is simply due to the fact that Bennett<BR>does not understand the distinction to begin with. Nowhere<BR>in his brief explanation does he show the root of the distinction,<BR>and that is: analytic propositions do not need to be verified in<BR>intuition, synthetic propositions do. Instead, he considers<BR>the addition of the predicate to a concept to be arbitrary,<BR>and 'therefore' Kant is guilty of an oversight by neglecting<BR>the possibility of false propositions. Bennett's solution to<BR>this \\"oversight\\" is to derive a third class of distinctions<BR>to deal with false propositions.<br />Let's return in the text to Bennett's primary examples,<BR>the ones used by Kant: 1. All bodies are extended,<BR>2. The body is heavy. We do not, always consider<BR>weight to be in the manifold of the concept \\"body,\\"<BR>therefore, Bennett declares, the latter proposition is<BR>synthetic.<br />Perhaps it is Kant's fault for the confusion, because<BR>at least in this part of his explanation he does not<BR>bring in the element of intuition (as I recall). He does,<BR>however, bring it up when discussing the status of<BR>the proposition 7 + 5 = 12. It is necessary, Kant<BR>states, to appeal to intuition in determining that<BR>7 (sticks) added to 5 (sticks) equal 12 (sticks, or<BR>fingers or whatever). The same goes for a<BR>proposition such as \\"the body is heavy.\\" For in<BR>determining this, we do not simply attach any<BR>old predicate that is not in the manifold that is always<BR>present in the concept; that truly would be arbitrary.<BR>Rather, we lift the \\"body\\" (say, a 50 pound sack of<BR>onions) and, granted that this is a difficult task for us,<BR>declare  the body  to be heavy. Granted this is a<BR>different sort of proposition than the mathematical one,<BR>but the important fact is that both are verified<BR>in intuition (even if the latter example is sometimes<BR>dependent on your own strength; but then simply<BR>imagine, in intuition, things that are heavy to<BR>everybody...). And more importantly, the point that<BR>intuition is important to the distinction between synthetic<BR>and analytic judgments is completely overlooked in<BR>Bennett's analysis.<br />It cannot actually be Kant's fault,however because<BR>as I read later on Bennett does bring up the example<BR>from mathematics. He quotes the relevant passage<BR>from Kant, but somehow omits the reference to <BR>intuition *which is contained in the very next sentence<BR>after the material Bennett quoted!* To wit, \\"We must<BR>go beyond these concepts and avail ourselves of the<BR>intuition corresponding to one of the two [either 5 fingers<BR>or 5 dots]\\" (B15, tr. Pluhar). <br />Bennett... is NOT good. I do not recommend this<BR>his unthought-out approach to Kant's CPR.	2002-02-11

He had access to Garth Brooks for what was suposed to be a magazine article (which never materialised) for about 48 hours total.  Much of what is written is a re-hash of past articles, conjecture and 'sound bites' from Garth Brooks. I have had it on good authority from Garth himself to disbelieve the majority of what is written about him. For example, Mr Feiler portrays Mr Brooks as a 'womaniser' throughout school; Mrs Brooks (Garth's mum) had stated in several interviews Garth did not date widely, and  was somewhat shy in that area.<br />There are several easily verified errors in the book. The Wynonna web sites deride this piece of fiction, and perhaps that is the best description: fiction.	2002-02-10

David Stove has posthumously achieved celebrity status with this book. This status is not well earned because Stove and his claque have completely missed the point of Popper's philosophy and the way that it has sidelined the long-running and pointless academic obsession with knowledge as \\"justified true belief\\".<br />Popper has provided a viable alternative to the \\"justified true belief\\" theory of knowledge. He has propounded a theory of conjectural objective knowledge which grows by conjecture and criticism of various kinds, including the criticism of empirical tests. This is a matter of commonsense and it is not hard to explain to scientists and other practical people who have not had their brains addled by academic philosophy and its fruitless quest for the non-achievable - verified theories or \\"truly justified beliefs\\" or merely theories with a specified numerical probability. Those, like Stove, who think that inductive probabilities can be assigned to theories, have yet to provide the formula after some centuries of effort.<br />The fruitless and boring quest for inductive probabilities has driven many students from the pursuit of rationalist philosophy in search of more interesting and exciting fare, hence the rise of the deconstructionists and post-modernists and other related fads and cults. Stove and others have blamed this tendency on Popper's \\"irrationalism\\" but this is precisely the reverse of the true situation. It is the failure of the positivists and the inductivists to deliver the magic formula which has wrecked their credibility.<br />Popper has provided the antidote to irrationalism but he has been so thoroughly sidelined in academic philosophy that students can only find out about his ideas by accident, apart from the garbled and miseading misconceptions of his thoughts that are perpetuated by his opponents.<br />For a more enlightening introduction to Popper's ideas, in the context of the main postwar philosophical developments, read Bryan Magee \\"Confession of a Philosopher\\".e \\"Confession of a Philosopher\\".	2002-02-08

The last 1/3 of the book is devoted to &quot;tecniques&quot; that can be used to aid the user in his/her ability to use the healing arts (although he saids, that you cannot teach it).  I've read other books that deal with healing with hands techniques as well, and they offer similar insights to this book.  After reading the book, I tried this on myself... So far nothing has happened (he explains that for some poeple it may take weeks for the reconnection to occur).  One thing that cannot be verified in this process is whether or not there is a sort of placebo effect of the book (somebody says that it works, and for many people a placebo does have some results).  Not saying that the book does or does not work, it's just that I wouldn't expect any sort of miracles to happen after you've read the book.  He claims that by reading his book, that you will receive the specific type of energy necessary in order supposedly open up pathways that may facilitate a greater potential for healing in an individual.  Spiritually, I can understand why this might happen (it's like chemistry, you are about 75% of your own environment, unless you are a young soul, with older souls or with karmicly ridden people the percentage is higher.  Coming into contact with other people of different levels of awareness and energy patterns preclude that you react to the other person in a certain type of way.  You can see some evidence of this in astrology and numerology.).  This is not to say, however, that this is actually happening.  Different people will have difference experiences and I suspect, like with medicine and foods, different people will be impacted differently depending upon their own personal circumanstances.  It didn't do much for me, but apparently from the other reviews it seems to be doing something for other people.  If you can get it from the library or get it used, then there is very little to lose from reading it (other than money).  Although some poeple will feel that they are getting conned after reading this book (especially if they don't see any results).	2002-02-08

Rather, most of his work evolved out of what he described as \\"thought experiments\\" wherein he posed questions and considered-and rejected-possible solutions in his head.  To the extent his theories have been \\"scientifically\\" verified, it has been through  the lab work of others who sought to prove or disprove his theories.<br />Lightman has taken the \\"thought experiment\\" concept and converted it into this work, transforming the waking \\"experiments\\" into sleep time \\"dreams\\" that, through a series of short vignettes, illustrate both the process and the substance of Einstien's theories and work processes.<br />To the scientifically sophisticated-especially about physics-- this book will probably come across as simplistic and a bit of a bore.  Everyone else, that being, I suspect, 99.995% of the potential audience for the work, should find it both fascinating and somewhat educational.<br />Be aware, however, this book is about Einstein's ideas-not about the man himself.

We have this book online: [...] <BR>It has now been about one hundred and sixty years since the first publication of perhaps the greatest apologetics book of all times. It is true that there are many fine books suited for their specific objects, and not less true that many valuable books have fulfilled a particular demand in the needful evidences for the Christian Evangelical Faith; but none can be found that has so comprehensively covered the ground in a way that not only reaches all essential beliefs or doctrines necessary for life in this world and that to come, but that also has been so recognized by the church at large to be so. When we come to this volume and are delightfully and almost magnetically carried through it, we soon find that it is not such a piece of the puzzle that books before it were, but rather it satisfies the heart and mind of the candid inquirer quenching his universal and systematic desires for the unified system of belief.<BR>  In the introduction below, we are informed that the arguments presented in this volume are largely independent of other works and not borrowed. Notwithstanding the style and harmony of all the chapters however, it can be seen through the works we are publishing that the major ideas were borrowed from worthy and spiritually sympathetic authors just previous to the first publication. And much more than Darwin, who organized an unsystematized-and unfortunately false-natural philosophy into a compelling system which thus gave it credibility, our author gives us more than a coherent hypothesis yet to be verified, but rather a presentation that unifies the subjects of the highest importance with the best demonstrations from all the important departments of the mind and life.<BR>  Those familiar with Asa Mahan's encyclopedic writings on all major branches of philosophy will find a very close identity of presenting the philosophical ideas in this book. Equally manifest will be the relation to Charles G. Finney's understanding of reformation and disinterested benevolence. And while Jonathan Edwards first presented this last idea less developed, our author no doubt also borrows much from him in his analysis of the Affections. We will finally notice but one more author, Caleb Burge, whose monumental work on the Atonement in 1822 must have had influence on the illustrations given in this work.<BR> These men all shared the same moral government and orthodox understanding of the Plan of Salvation, and their profound works in our opinion helped to elevate society and the church to a higher level than it ever knew and has since known. The reason is plain-not that they invented new ideas, or were clever to manipulate men by sophestry-on the contrary, they simply acknowledged their true limitations, sought answers from all facts available, depended upon no unverified evidence, focused on essential matters in the nature of their circumstances, and insisted upon no weak arguments, but gave us an impartial, coherent, system of practical truth that was only to convince an honest mind.<BR>  Some years back we endeavored to compile a similar work, not yet being familiar with this. It is now wondered whether that work would not be a disservice to the subjects defended in comparison with this masterpiece. We do not see the need to improve our work to this level, and are convinced that the world and the church do not need anything further to be satisfied with the objects of this book. In the future it will thus be our desire to only slightly adapt this work to our day (as this was a book for the times) in a recording of this volume for tapes and CD.<BR>We are selling this book $9.50 in print: TruthInHeart.com 616-447-8124	2002-02-04
US	52571938	R3C8ADTMKS7SDC	0452011019	118162393	Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand (Ayn Rand Library)	Books	4	15	36	N	N	Good book, but it's not perfect.	My review of this book is in two parts.  One part deals with its presentation of Objectivism.  The second part deals with how correct the ideas that its presents are.  I'm not a dispassionate reviewer of this book, if such a thing truly exists.  I have two Objectivist brothers and I once admired the philosophy.  OPAR, for me, was the beginning of a restoration of my commitment to rationality.  However, my view of OPAR and Objectivism has changed quite a bit since I first read OPAR: I do admit that a vast majority of my positions are now rationally validated.<br />As a single work that presents Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand, this book does quite well.  I have most of Rand's books and I've read quite a few of them.  I think Peikoff more than adequately captures the essence and spirit of Rand's thought.  His hierarchical presentation of Objectivism is an added plus and this work is a monument to system building.  This book DOES present Ayn Rand's philosophy and if this is the sole standard that the book is to be judged by, then I think even those who do not like Objectivism must nod with approval. <br />While I can recommend this book to those who want to study Ayn Rand's thought, I cannot recommend the philosophy of Objectivism to people as anything but a source of insights which should be carefully contemplated and thoroughly researched.  The primary danger is that while Rand, Peikoff and OPAR are right about many things, they are also wrong about many things, and the effort required to disprove them is one that many people will be unable to undertake.  Amongst these problems are subtle inconsistencies within the philosophy (and OPAR), inconsistencies with respect to reality, and misrepresentations of other points of view.  I will try to give simple examples  (others would be too complex for an Amazon review), and explain the source given the premises of the philosophy.<br />I think that many Web resources have discussed the fact that even Rand's account ofconcept formation relies on specific universals (length, color and other attributes) as defined by contemporary philosophy.  I will not go too deeply into this to keep the review under 1000 words.  The key question is how we form similar ideas - to form SIMILAR ideas, those universals (repeatable features) must be given in reality, unless the laws of identity and causality are to be denied. <br />The Objectivist view of causality is a subtle attempt to allow agent causation as the source of what it considers free will, and to avoid the problems facing arguments against determinism.  The Objectivist view of causality says that every entity \\"must act in accordance with its nature\\".  Of course no one doubts this: however, what is the entity's nature under *specific conditions*?  Or are the specific conditions now a part of the nature of the entity?  Without determinism, or the ability to predict that if certain conditions obtain in the sphere of human action, certain results should occur, how does one engage in any form of psychology (or philosophy)?  How does one study social sciences like economics, if a person's nature and the circumstances that he finds himself in do not necessitate the decision he made?  Peikoff's example uses a balloon containing helium and a balloon containing sand.  What if the balloon was made of steel? What if the balloon was an airtight safe?  What if the balloon is released in an anti-gravity chamber, or in space?  Is the \\"choice to focus\\" independent of hunger?  Or is it independent of previous results of \\"focusing\\"?  Or maybe it is easier to focus when under pressure?  Complexity does not negate determinism.  There are dangers in people's misconceptions of what determinism entails, but Objectivism's concept of free will is simply untenable and confuses deterministic with mechanistic.  Paradoxical questions about consciousness are numerous; however, this is not the reason to condemn a position that has a factual and scientific basis. THERE is room for honest disagreement here.  Objectivism's view of concept formation is such that a concept is often applied with a suggestion of complete appropriateness without a review of the PRECISE context in which it was formed.  Hence, some Objectivists do not empathize sufficiently before dismissing other positions.<br />Objectivism claims that the intrinsicist school of philosophers holds that values are independent of consciousness and of life.  Well, Scott Ryan, and I have verified his claim, pointed out that Brand Blanshard believed that intrinsic goods were states of consciousness, and that other people have argued for other forms of intrinsic goods all dependent on consciousness.  The reason why Peikoff (and Rand did this too) can get away with this misrepresentation is because he rarely cites PRIMARY sources.  This is also related to my criticism of how Objectivists apply concepts.  We are all \\"guilty\\" of this problem given our finite nature of human beings, but those of us who are reasonable do not use it to claim omniscience of any form by ignoring contexts that are unacceptable to us.<br />This is a critical review because Objectivists often place Ayn Rand above error because they cannot check her insights in fields they do not specialize in.  This is good book of you want to know what Objectivism is about.  However, as a source of facts, the average reader, who will probably know much less about philosophy than is required to critically read this book.  He is asked to consider other defenders of reason, like Brand Blanshard and Laurence Du Bonjour, who are very often, but not always correct, and are open to genuine disagreement.  Blanshard's books are out of print and expensive (I didn't say that Rand was wrong that reason is under attack in modern day culture). Objectivist OPAR readers, realize that not all people who disagree with some of Objectivism's positions are irrational, given some of the problems that Objectivism's views of those who disagree with you might lead you into.	2002-02-03

I first stumbled onto this book by accident in the spring of 1980.  Ever since I read Dr. McBride's book, my greatest professional ambition has been to teach speed reading to children.<br />Vearl McBride goes beyond just speed reading.  He demonstrates the immense possibilities of speed reading in opening up the minds of our children in many ways and in many subject areas.  And after 30 years, the world still doesn't have a clue how important his discoveries are.<br />I'll admit, the only motive that I had to speed read, at first, was to go through  my college textbooks faster and cut my study time in half.  <br />What got my attention was the VISION that McBride showed for the subject of Speed Reading.  <br />For example, McBride experimented with the idea of TEACHING FOREIGN LANGUAGES USING SPEED READING TECHNIQUES.  Here how it works:<br />Many pages of reading material (stories) are translated from English into Spanish.  Each line of English text is followed by the identical line of text in Spanish.  So each page of the story has alternating lines of English and Spanish.  This allows the children to see all the words and their respective translations at a glance. <br />For the next 6 weeks, the children are taught to speed read, using hundreds of pages of the bi-lingual text as the reading material.  At the end of 6 weeks, the children are able to speed read Spanish-only text at up to 2,000 wpm, with comprehension.<br />Really.<br />I know it sounds improbable, but take a look at Dr. McBride's other achievements:<br />1)  He discovered and pioneered the idea that young children can and should be taught to speed read.  He was virtually ignored for over 30 years.  His work is still ignored by most of the experts and many within the speed reading industry itself.  <br />Dr McBride's book was so good, that when I finally wrote a book of my own (SPEED READING 4 KIDS) I dedicated it to Vearl G. McBride.<br />After having taught speed reading to thousands of people, myself, from ages 7 through 77, I can say with confidence that young children from ages 8-12 learn speed reading the easiest of any age group.  I know many parents and teachers who have achieved similar results in teaching children to speed read (even parents who can't speed read themselves can teach it to kids).<br />2)  He improvised a way to teach blind people to speed read in Braille.  He even conducted 2 or 3 workshops in Hong Kong for this very purpose and received an award from the government of Hong Kong for his achievement.  <br />His fastest Braille speed reader attained a rate of 4,000 wpm with good comprehension<br />3)  He was the first one, that I am aware of, who taught that many of the Learning Disabled can do quite well with speed reading.  I have found in my own work that children with such so-called disabilities as ADD, Dyslexia and some others, actually seem gifted when it comes to learning to speed read.  Many of these are the very ones who get photographic memories when they master the art of speed reading.<br />These are just three areas in which there is independent verification of the results he claimed.  I have seen some of these results in my own work (I haven't attempted the Braille experiment myself yet, but I am aware of the award that the government of Hong Kong gave to Dr. McBride).  In fact, in every facet of speed reading that I have experimented with myself, I have also received the same results claimed by Dr. McBride.<br />So, even though I haven't personally verified every experiment that Dr McBride did (yet), I have great faith in the results he claimed.  <br />I am hoping that more people will come forward to start making many of his other innovations a universal reality.  Speed reading in foreign languages is one thing that should be experimented with soon. <br />Another innovation that Dr. McBride worked on is SPEED MATH.<br />How did Dr McBride do that?<br />First they would write up many math problems (in this example, addition problems) per page, on hundreds of pages of paper.  Using speed reading techniques, the children would go over these problems at the rate of thousands of problems per minute.  After 6 weeks or so, the children would be able to view any addition problem and instantly tell the answer.  Even large stacks of numbers could be added instantly.<br />I've had a personal friend for over 15 years who can look at a whole page of numbers added together and instantly know the correct answer.  In my friend's case, nobody taught him the skill.  He's always been able to do this since he was a child.  My friend uses this skill in his business constantly.  It has helped him to earn a large income and still have time for his family. <br />Dr. McBride used the principles of speed reading to train whole classes of children to have this very skill.  Who wouldn't want their second-grade child to be this good at math? <br />Can you see where we're headed with speed reading?  To borrow a popular slogan A MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE.  Our minds have almost unlimited potential if we just open our eyes and see the possibilities.<br />I only wish Dr McBride would republish this book or come out with a revised, updated edition.	2002-01-31

I find it difficult to believe that any of the reviewers who gave this book 5 stars have read the book. 4 1/2 must surely relate to awe of the author.  My rating is five stars for Chapter 6, one for all the rest.<br />The reviewer who stated \\"Hardly anything in here is known to exist. Things like 11-dimensional supergravity, p-branes, and a number of other things he mentions are nothing more than purely theoretical constructs that have no verification in the real universe. They exist only in his mind.\\",  has hit the nail squarely and completely on the head and little more need be said on the relevance of the subjects Hawking presents to the average person. <br /> Describing the matter contained in the book as theories is questionable.  Theories are accepted if they provide predictions that can be verified or refuted.  It is unlikely that any of the theories which describe multi-dimensional spacetime, p-branes (those of us for whom he wrote the book?), strings, supergravity, time loops and other fascinating but useless concepts in the real world, will ever be either verified or refuted.  Should a theory not be accompanied by a suggestion for testing it?  How does one approach describing a test to verify or refute the theory associated with worm-holes?  What real world information indicates the existence or structure of any of these concepts? Hawkings leaves that out.<br />On the positive side, Amazon's price for the book is nearly a gift for two parts of the book alone, the Glossary and Chapter 6, Our Future? Star Trek or Not?. Chapter 6 is a highly thought provoking shot at predicting our future in terms of the real world, and is probably accurate.  The Glossary contains most of the useful matter in the book. Many of the superb illustrations in this well produced  book also contain interesting concepts, but as other reviewers have stated, they fall short of clarifying their targets.  Try to find this book in your local public library, read Chapter 6, xerox the Glossary, and put the book quickly back on the shelf before getting totally bemused/confused by the rest of it.<br />All of the books' subject matter is grist for the mills of brains such as Hawkings', but you should pass on this book unless you are curious to read material incomprehensible to lesser mortals.  Much material is simply thrown at you with no hint of rationale - take it or leave it - Hawking has spoken - the arrogance factor mentioned by another reviewer.  <br />Better reading is \\"Show Me God\\" by Fred Heeren.	2002-01-28

Read the National Archives and Records Administration resion below.<br />I've verified some of Ayres claims but the three errors above left a bad taste in my mouth since Ayres claims to be trying to correct American history.  Instead, he is propogating errors and myths!  There may be more errors, since I have not checked all of his stories.<br />================================================================  <br />TAPs:<br />Of all the American military bugle calls, none is so easily recognized or more apt to render emotional reactions than the 24 notes of the eloquent and haunting melody, Taps.  It's a song that usually leaves a lump in throats and creates tears in our eyes.  However, because its history is so interesting and clouded in controversy, its origin is worthy of further study.  <BR>Until the Civil War, the infantry bugle call for Lights Out had been borrowed from the French and set down in Silas Casey's manual, Tactics.  The music for Taps was changed by Union Brigadier General Daniel Adams Butterfield for use by his unit (Third Brigade, First Division, Fifth Army Corps, Army of the Potomac) in July 1862 while they were quartered at Harrisons Landing (Berkeley Plantation) in Virginia following the Seven Day's battle during the Peninsular Campaign. <BR>Butterfield was born in Utica, New York on October 31, 1831 and graduated from Union College at Schenectady.  He was a New York merchant and 1st Sergeant with the Clay Guards, a volunteer militia unit, when the Civil War broke out.  On May 2, 1861, he led the 12th Regiment of the New York State Militia to Washington as its Colonel.  Ten days later, he was commissioned a Lt. Colonel in the regular army where he commanded the 8th Brigade 3rd Division in the Shenandoah Valley during the First Bull Run campaign.  <BR>He was promoted to Brigadier General U.S. Volunteers in September 1861 and given command of the 3rd Brigade 1st Division (under Brigadier General George Morell) V Corps of the Army of the Potomac.  During the Peninsular campaign in Virginia, Butterfield served prominently at the Battle of Gaines Mill on June 27, 1862, when, although injured, he seized the colors of the 3rd Pennsylvania and rallied the regiment at a critical time despite relentless fire from the enemy.  Thirty years later, he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism.<BR>Butterfield also participated in the 2nd Battle of Bull Run and Antietam campaigns.  He succeeded Morell as Division Commander and led V Corps in the desperate assault against Maryes Heights in the battle for Fredericksburg.  On November 11, 1862, he was again recognized for his valor by being promoted to the rank of Major General U.S. Volunteers.  In this capacity, he served as Chief of Staff  (Army of the Potomac) for Generals Joseph Hooker and George Meade between the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg.<BR>Butterfield was promoted to Colonel 5th U.S. Infantry on July 1, 1863 as the opening shots at Gettysburg were being fired, and wounded during a subsequent engagement.  His duties as Chief of Staff at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg ultimately required his testimony before a Joint Congressional Committee investigating the Conduct of the War in March 1864.<BR>After recovering from his wounds, Butterfield rejoined Hooker as his Chief of Staff and participated in battles around Chattanooga.  Between April 1864 and June 1864, he commanded 3rd Division XX Corps (Army of the Cumberland) and took part in several battles in the vicinity of Atlanta, including the battle for Kennesaw Mountain.  <BR>By wars end, Butterfield was brevetted a major general.  He stayed in the army after the Civil War, serving as superintendent of the armys recruiting service in New York City but resigned from the army in 1870 to head the U.S. Subtreasury in NYC.  Eventually, he joined the American Express Company as its eastern superintendent and married in 1886 at the age of 55.  He was in charge of a number of special public ceremonies, including General William Tecumseh Shermans funeral in 1889 and Deweys triumphant return after the Battle of Manila (1900).  <BR>Butterfield died on July 17, 1901 in Cold Spring, NY.  Taps was played at his funeral.  Although he did not attend West Point, he was buried across the Hudson River in one the most ornate tombs at the Academys Cemetery.  There is also a monument to Butterfield in New York City near Grant's Tomb.  There is nothing on either monument that mentions Taps or Butterfield's association with the call.  In addition to Taps, he was also responsible for designing the armys system of corps badges during the Civil War.<BR>An account of how Butterfield composed the bugle call surfaced in an article written by Gustav Kobbe, a music historian and critic, in the August 1898 issue of Century Magazine.   In the article, called The Trumpet in Camp and Battle, Kobbe wrote about the origin of Civil War bugle calls.  In regards to Taps, he wrote:<BR>In speaking of our trumpet calls I purposely omitted one with which it seemed most appropriate to close this article, for it is the call which closes the soldier's day .... Lights Out.  I have not been able to trace this call to any other service.  If it seems probable, it was original with Major Seymour; he has given our army the most beautiful of all trumpet-calls.<BR>Kobbe was basing his claim on the Army drill manual for infantry tactics prepared by Major General Emory Upton in 1867 (and revised in 1874).  The bugle calls in the manual had been compiled by Major (later General) Truman Seymour of the 5th U.S. Artillery.  Taps was incorrectly called Lights Out in this manual since it was a replacement for the earlier version disliked by Butterfield.  The real title of the call was not added until later, although other manuals started calling it Taps because most soldiers already knew it by that name.  Since Seymour was responsible for music in the manual, Kobbe assumed that he had written the call.  <BR>Kobbes article prompted a letter from Oliver W. Norton in Chicago who claimed he knew how the call came to be and that he was the first to perform it.  Norton wrote:<BR>I was much interested in reading the article by Mr. Gustav Kobbe, on the Trumpet and Bugle Calls, in the August Century.  Mr. Kobbe says that he has been unable to trace the origin of the call now used for Taps, or the Go to Sleep, as it is generally called by the soldiers.  As I am unable to give the origin of this call, I think the following statement may be of interest to Mr. Kobbe and your readers. <BR>	2002-01-27
US	53069863	R3FFF5NV7DQCZY	0743224574	87039745	A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash	Books	3	34	37	N	N	Some difficulties with this biography of John Nash...	This biography is unusual in several respects. First, it is relatively uncommon for an unauthorized biography of a living person to receive this sort of attention. I certainly don't dispute that the subject of this biography is certainly interesting (if not always admirable), but as a biography, it is certainly missing some essential contribution and one must wonder why Dr. Nash did not participate more actively in the production of a story of his life.<br />As a result, nearly all of the voluminous citations in the text refer to private correspondences or private interviews with some of Nash's contemporaries. One can hardly be too critical of this, of course, but it also makes it nearly impossible to decide whether the biographer has correctly interpreted the results of these interviews. Charity demands that we assume that she neither intentionally nor carelessly misconstrued any information she received, but it does leave the reader with very little opportunity to veryify the claims made.<br />This would not be so troubling if there were not so many egregious errors in the explanatory portion of the text. As one reader noted, Fermat was NOT a co-discoverer with Newton of the calculus. The simultaneous discovery of the calculus by Leibniz and Newton is among the best known cases of simultaneous discovery in the history of science, and led to long and bitter acrimony between Newton and Leibniz (Newton being seemingly convinced that Leibniz has somehow stolen his ideas). Elsewhere, the author makes use of the term \\"Gedanken experiments\\" to refer, apparently, to the ability to make rapid calculations in one's head. This is simply not the way in which that phrase is used in the philosophy of science, where it is quite a common term; rather, it refers to experiments which either are nor, or cannot be, physically realized (e.g., Einstein's use of the equivalence of gravity and uniform accelleration of an elevator in his (popular) exposition of general relativity), but from which consequences can be deduced. More appallingly, Ms. Nasar simply gets some elementary mathematics wrong, as when she refers to the general equation of a circle and the equation for an hyperbbola. In the first case, she gives the equation only for the \\"unit\\" circle, and in the second case, the equations if just flat out wrong. XY=1 is just NOT the general equation for the hyperbola. I regret that these expample do not exhaust the problematic parts of Ms. Nasar's exposition.<br />Is this being picky? I'm not sure. I certainly believe that her editors should have caught such errors before the book went to press, but if such elementary mathematical errors abound, how much much credance can we give to her exposition of far more complex mathematical concepts and issues? Indeed, it causes me to be somewhat uneasy about other facts or interpretations which cannot be independently verified.<br />Now, I don't imagine that the book grossly distorts Dr. Nash's unhappy life, but I'd be a lot happier if I was certain that the inattention to detail was not replicated in sources to which I have no access.<br />This being said, the book does introduce a wide audience to a very unusal man and a very unusual time in American science, and so I think the book is worth reading. But I'm not ready to bet large sums of money on the accuracy of any of the details.<br />That the movie is even more cavalier about detail than the book is not any great surprise; the movie is still quite enjoyable and worth viewing, but I would look forward to a somewhat more rigorous account of Dr. Nash than this biography provides.	2002-01-22

This is one of those books that present you with the option of putting it away or testing your endurance to reach the end.  Unfortunately, I chose the latter course.  Aside from the brief visit with our favorite forensic doctor, the book is filled with characters that frankly insult the reader's intelligence.  Imagine, a crab that throws a bit of metal into a boat as a diversionary tactic.  Or, perhaps it makes more sense to have state police search for a specific trout that was thrown into a river (to be verified by DNA evidence from the bucket from whence it was thrown) so that it could perhaps offer testimony or evidence related to the shooting of a fisherman by a flare gun.  To add to the insult, the plot is entirely ridiculous and frayed.  So much so that my wife and I (we bought the book on tape) would jokingly predict the most ludicrous plot twist imaginable only to sadly see these come about.  Though I am generally a fan of Patricia Cornwell, I can recommend this book to no one.	2002-01-16

Overall the book is a good addition to juvenile literature on the subject, and it deserves a place in the classroom. I would use it, provided I could correct the obsolete terminology and misleading ideas that appear in several places. Few scientists give credibility to the idea that living cells could have arrived on a comet or meteor, although it is more feasible that some molecular building blocks of life came that route. The Archean Eon is not named, but its events are combined with the Proterozoic. The author uses the old name &quot;blue-green algae&quot; instead of cyanobacteria. I take issue with the statement &quot;Winter and summer as we know them today did not yet exist&quot;. The tilt of the Earth's axis did exist, even if the wobble changed the angle. The author implies that many changes in life happened very suddenly. I think this gives children a false impression. The description of the first fish implies that fish with jaws appeared as soon as jawless fish. The book states &quot;The first plants sprouted, and the first beetles, bugs, and butterflies hatched.&quot; The fossil record shows the first land arthropods were wingless. Butterfly fossils don't appear until around the time the flowering plants evolve. The sail-backed amniotes are described as reptiles - not the worse sin, but these animals were on another line of descent, the one that lead to mammals. The Paleozoic extinction is shown as a sudden event, when it likely was more gradual and had multiple causes. If fungi took over the planet at the end of this extinction, the fossil record doesn't show it. Flying reptiles are described incorrectly as dinosaurs. Text accompaning an illustration of a Plesiosaur-like reptile, which is not a dinosaur, talks about dinosaur fossils. In the Cenozoic section, the implication is that egg-laying mammals evolved for the first time, when paleonologists think thatMesozoic mammals and their ancestors were egg-laying. A grammatical note - the names of genera should be in italics.<br />I liked the inclusion of the idea that humans are still evolving and that life will continue to change.<br />Children should know the history of life on Earth. They deserve accurate information. This book would be a better contribution if the author had verified the information she gives.	2002-01-14

Chief among them is the myth that thousands of scientific papers actually address Behe's challenge.<br />At the ARN website, however, Behe shreds these initially impressive but shoddily-compiled claims:<br />&quot;The assertion here that very many papers have been published clashes with statements of the reviews I quoted earlier which say, for example, that &quot;The problems have indeed been sorely neglected.&quot; (Cavalier-Smith 1997) Would reviewers such as Jerry Coyne and Tom Cavalier-Smith--both antagonistic to my proposal of intelligent design--be unaware of the &quot;hundreds, possibly thousands, of scientific papers that deal with this very subject&quot;? Both claims--that the problems have been neglected and that the problems are being actively investigated--cannot be correct. Either one set of reviewers is wrong, or there is some confusion about which publications to count. Which is it?<br />&quot;In the context of my book it is easy to realize that I meant there has been little work on the details of the evolution of irreducibly complex biochemical systems by Darwinian means. I had clearly noted that of course a large amount of work in many books and journals was done under the general topic of &quot;molecular evolution,&quot; but that, overwhelmingly, it was either limited to comparing sequences (which, again, does not concern the mechanism of evolution) or did not propose sufficiently detailed routes to justify a Darwinian conclusion. Yet the Catalano site lists virtually any work on evolution, whether it pertains to irreducible complexity or not. For example it lists semi-popular books such as Patterns in Evolution: The New Molecular View by Roger Lewin, and general textbooks on molecular evolution such as Molecular Evolution by Wen-Hsiung Li.<br />&quot;Such books simply don't address the problems I raise. ... [Li's book] does not include how specific, irreducibly-complex biochemical systems were built. The text contains chapters on the molecular clock, molecular phylogenetics, and other topics which essentially are studies in comparing gene sequences. As I explained in Darwin's Black Box, comparing sequences is interesting but cannot explain how molecular machines arose. Li's book also contains chapters on the mechanisms (such as gene duplication, domain shuffling, and concerted evolution of multigene families) that are thought to be involved in evolution at the molecular level. Again, however, no specific system is justified in Darwinian terms.<br />&quot;... Li himself has not done work on understanding how the obstacles to the evolution of the clotting cascade may have been circumvented. Since those investigators who do work in that area have not yet published a detailed Darwinian pathway in the primary literature (1), we can conclude that the answer will not be found in a more general text. We can further assume that the processes that text describes (gene duplication, etc.), although very significant, are not by themselves sufficient to understand how clotting, or by extension any complex biochemical system, may have arisen by Darwinian means.<br />&quot;Catalano's site lists other books that I specifically discussed in Darwin's Black Box, where I noted that, while they present mathematical models or brief general descriptions, they do not present detailed biochemical studies of specific irreducibly complex systems. (Gillespie 1991; Selander et al. 1991) There is no explanation on Catalano's web site of why he thinks they address the questions I raised.<br />&quot;... In Finding Darwin's God (Miller 1999) Kenneth Miller is also anxious to show my claims about the literature are not true (or at least are not true now, since the handful of papers he cites in his section &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; were published after my book appeared). Yet none of the papershe cites deals with irreducibly complex systems. ...&quot;<br />Seems like it's time for fundamentalist Darwinists to be a little more skeptical, a little more open-minded - and a little more rational. Behe's book gently nudges them back towards empirical science, rather than evolutionism, which one frustrated evolutionist finally proclaimed &quot;a fairy-tale for grown-ups.&quot;pers he cites deals with irreducibly complex systems. ...&quot;<br />Seems like it's time for fundamentalist Darwinists to be a little more skeptical, a little more open-minded - and a little more rational.

His book must be seriously considered as a possible catalyst toward the Vatican's decision to canonize Joan in 1920.<br />The capture and subsequent execution of Joan of Arc occurred in 1431. Except for some correspondence which resulted in the Vatican annulling her sentence in 1456, nothing more was written about the girl until the first biography about her was published -- 400 years after her death. <br />It is not difficult to suppose that the length and upheavals of the intervening centuries resulted in her becoming a mostly legendary figure by 1840. Until Mark Twain began to publish his findings 60 years later, no more than a dozen biographies were produced, many containing accounts based solely on conjecture; relying on folklore.<br />Mark Twain spent 12 years in France, during which time he learned French and was able to secure that<BR>government's permission to search their archives. As the most popular writer of his time, his book reawakened interest in Joan's life and martyrdom, and not only among his faithful readers. It is usually with extreme caution that<BR>the procedures leading to Canonization are undertaken by the Vatican, with each and every fact verified in detail.<br />Would the Vatican have gone to the considerable effort necessary to research the circumstances under which<BR>a legendary and obscure young soldier-girl was purportedly martyred half a millenium beforehand, if it did not already<BR>have most of the facts it needed in order to effect her Canonization?<br />It is reasonable to consider that the Canonization of St. Joan of Arc, on May 16, 1920, 500 years after the end of <BR>her her short career, might perhaps have resulted from the renewed interest in her life -- interest awakened due to the 12 years Mark Twain spent learning the realities surrounding the life of the girl soldier he admired so much.	2002-01-10

If that combination seems odd to you now it won't by the end of the book.  He carefully and prudently refrains from arguing that reincarnation occurs; instead, he records some unusual and seemingly anomalous facts--carefully documented--and gives the reader the option of deciding whether reincarnation is or is not the best explanation for them.  Stevenson remains open to the possibility of alternative explanations for how young, scarcely-verbal children can recite details about the lives of people they have never met, but by the end of the book it's clear that the usual mechanistic and biological explanations cannot suffice.<br />Simply put, Stevenson interviews kids between the ages of (usually) 2 and 7 who have stories to tell about who they were, by their own description, in a previous life.  He then attempts to identify the previous personality, and to verify or disprove every detail of the child's story.  He writes about kids who talk about being a fishmonger with a green jeep in a distant town they have never visited, and don't know anyone who has visited; kids who have birthmarks corresponding to entry and exit bullet-wounds they claim to have received when murdered, and who give the details of their deaths, later verified; and kids who claim to have another family and reveal that other family's secrets.  Such cases are the tip of Stevenson's iceberg.  <br />Stevenson makes a few speculative claims in his concluding chapters, and I think he could be more appreciative of the historical criticisms of vitalistic thinkers, from the alchemists to Goethe.  He speculates a bit too much about the implications his research has for theories of personality, and in a few places his self-restraint feels strained.  But his claims for a mind-brain dualism are excellent, as are his suggestions about the self-reconstructing capacities of the human psyche.  This last is particularly important as some writers in this area, often under the spell of Jung, have denied the individual's capacity for self-reflective growth.  If you seem backed into a corner after reading this book, remember that even if Stevenson's hypothesis is correct, the theory of reincarnation provides no definitive insights to the nature of the psyche, and offers no absolutes regarding conduct, morality, and change.	2002-01-06

Pike is a Scottish Freemason and, in my suspicion, a white supremacist (please don't construe my words as a statement against all Freemasons, merely Pike).  Pike belonged to an intellectual institution which asserted many \\"facts\\" about the Aryans and their origins which are not verified by other institutions and are, indeed, found to be quite dubious by some.  In his Lectures on the Arya (a seperate work, not the work under review), he makes the claim that the Aryans were of a white skin which is of course not agreed upon at all by the institutions of the world neither is it verifiable through any legitimate historical accounts.  He makes many assertions on the geographical origins of the Arya which are also not verified or corroborated by other intellectual institutions.  He goes on to proclaim that the Aryans were the race which gave rise to the Celts, the Saxons, the Angles, and Europeans as a whole and I shouldn't have to point out that this is utter speculation on the part of Pike and his intellectual predecessors.<br />In his Lecture on the Arya, it seems to me that Pike was attempting to construct a history in which his ideal white man is an original being completely uninfluenced by the Semites or any other peoples in the fields of spirituality, linguistics, and culture as a whole.<br />While I have yet to read Indo-Aryan Deities and Worship As Contained in the Rig-Veda by Albert Pike, I am certain it is full of his bias.  The appearance of the phrase \\"Indo-Aryan\\" in the title is further evidence of his slant; the \\"Indo-Aryans\\" are an \\"ethnic group\\" whose very existence is uncomfirmable.<br />Do not be mislead by the words in the book's description which read, \\"I found the most profound philosophic or metaphysical ideas, which those of every philosophy and religion have merely developed; and that, so far from being Barbarians orSavages, the old Aryan herdsmen and husbandmen, in the Indus country under the Himalayan Mountains, on the rivers of Bactria, and long before, on the Scythic Steppes where they originated, were men of singularly clear and acute intellects, profound thought and an infinite reverence of the beings whom they worshipped.\\"  The statements about the geographical home(s) of the Arya as well as their movements are purely speculatory to say nothing of the origins of the aforementioned \\"philosophic or metaphysical ideas.\\"<br />While I am not in a position to judge it as so, I suspect that Indo-Aryan Deities and Worship As Contained in the Rig-Veda<br />by Albert Pike is little more than a continuation of the author's endeavor to create a mythology of the ideal white man and his \\"influence\\" on world culture.  The aspect which Pike's works display the most paucity in is that of concrete evidence; his conclusions are drawn in the absence of absolute proof of the assumptions.  This book may not be valuable for it's historical accuracy, but as a piece which reveals the suppositions and fallacies of an intellectual institution, it might be interesting.	2001-12-31

No one in this life, however faithful, can be absolutely sure that he has THE answers.  All anyone can truly have is a good guess about directions in which to look for those answers.  I have found Mr. Price to be a good guide partly because he has traveled farther down that solitary road than most of us and has come back with the willingness to report his findings in the clearest voice that anyone can have under such circumstances.  P.S. I'm bothered a bit by Amazon's recent emphasis on &#34;verified purchase&#34; status, as if those are the only opinions worth reading. In fact, this book was recommended to me by Mr. Price himself, who said it was an older book that I might have trouble finding in a bookstore. I did find it, though, at a fine, independent bookstore (that has since closed) in my small, college town, and I later bought at least three more copies to share with friends in need. Now, 16 years later, I'm facing a comparable situation to what I describe in my original review. I plan to reread this Letter. If necessary, I will update that review, though it won't be promoted as a verified purchase. (6/16/17)	2001-12-30

The actor, Franchot Tone, did try to pick up Ms. Short, unsuccessfully, and the Tone family has its own reasons to keep this factoid under wraps, second, the LAPD has had a Metro Division since 1933, in what is now Parker Center, and was in Room 114. Third, the detective, Herman Willis, was an actual detective at the time of the murder. These accounts can be easily verified on the Internet, and pointing them out as errors is more reflective of the critic/LA Times reporter's personal agenda rather than actual fact. The book is actually an extremely well-written, thoughtful and evocative account of this girl's descent into the quagmire of 1940's Hollywood, the absolute worst of the worst in terms of decadence and predatory types. She sought out the kind of people who were involved in petty schemes and nefarious doings and eventually encountered her killer in this melange of monsters. Her sole focus was on fame, and she did whatever she could to attain what she hoped would be a career in front of the cameras. There were plenty of criminal types who preyed on these girls, and would tell them anything they wanted to hear in order to take advantage of them and their dreams; unfortunately for Ms. Short, she went with the demon who tortured her for, what the coroner later speculated was a 72 hour torture session, and never saw her name up in lights, but achieved a grislier fame, as that of a victim who died such a terrible death that it is talked about and argued to this day, some 54 years later. Gilmore is a master of setting the mood of L.A. in the 1940's, replete with all the peripheral characters Hollywood was overflowing with and taking the reaader to the streets of same...his descriptions and attention to detail add to the rich mix of sin and glamour, the quest of which cost this doomed young girl her life. One cannot truly imagine what she endured waiting for death to release her from the horror of the things which were perpetrated on her body during those last agonal hours... Kudos to Mr. Gilmore for providing us with this incisive glimpse into a world long gone but brought back vividly to life, and giving us a taste of what Hollywood and this crime were really like and how they relate so well to each other; the perfect stage setting and the perfect crime, since no one has ever been charged, nor is likely to be at this late date.<br />Also recommended: Hollywood Babylon, Day of the Locusting for death to release her from the horror of the things which were perpetrated on her body during those last agonal hours...

Talk about a missing of the mark! This book demonstrates a scholars ability to mispercieve the higher spiritual dimension at work in Ramakrishna's life and in Tantra. Tantra explains bisexuality in terms of The Goddess and Shiva, and in terms of the right side and left side of the body. Ramakrishna in his/her God-intoxicated states BECAME FEMALE in a higher dimensional sense. Kripal demonstrates an abyssmal understanding of Tantra.<BR>   Perhaps this excerpt from a fantastic book entitled 'Kali's Odiyya' will explain better than I can: &quot;Sexual identity is strong in most people. They cling to their maleness or their femalness as if their very lives depend on it. Even though Shakti Bhava is the shortest path to the Divine Mother's heart, it is difficult for most men. To be willing to lose your male identity for the Divine Mother's love requires a very special love for the Divine Mother. So most men choose other ways to worship Her. Even in the case of those who undertake spiritual transvestitism during the Night of Kali festival, only a hanful may retain this state for the remainder of their life as part of a deeper karmic transformation. When a male is able to summon his female qualities, for the sole purpose of joining with Kali, he transforms from being a mere human to become Divine. Such a person's identity soars beyond body consciousness. That's the purpose of this ceromony and it has nothing to do with permanently changing a masculine body to a woman. The Divine Spirit in you is neither male nor female. It is sexless. The process of awakening this non-sexual spirit identity is by arousing the female within a man and the masculine in a woman&quot;.<BR>   There. Kripal has been refuted. He uses his logical mind and appears very witty in this context at times. I think he feels very smug and clever. In Tantra there are no categories such as straight or Homo, or latent homo, or whatever. If they/he whitewashedRamakrishna's life in the 'Gospel', there was a very good reason for it. Many of the Tantric practices are kept secret for the very reason that they offend most people's sensibilities, but this is only because they misunderstand the profound, profound, profound nature and implications of these practices, which are essentially penetrating beyond even the sub-atomic realms and breaking through to unimaginable spiritual dimensions. I have verified this.	2001-12-29

Clear, direct, and occasionally funny, Lactate Lift-Off covers a lot of ground for a slim volume of only 138 pages.<br />Anderson begins by offering the standard definition of LT and its relationship to running speed. He correctly reports that LT is the point at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood in an amount greater than resting levels. This happens at a running speed that corresponds approximately to 15km pace. In other words, all running speeds slower than 15km pace are below LT. As your speed increases above 15km pace oxygen becomes increasing scarce, lactic acid is produced in your muscles and is removed to the bloodstream as lactate. (Note: Lactic acid and lactate are very similar, but not the same. However, in most scientific literature regarding LT, the two are considered synonymous.)<br />But what exactly is lactate? Anderson answers the question by first telling us what lactate is not: \\"Lactic acid doesn't produce burning sensations, it does not induce soreness, and it's not a form of metabolic garbage....\\" He further explains that \\"...lactic acid is produced by your body all the time, around the clock, even when you're at rest....\\" Then we're told what the compound really is: \\"During exercise, lactate is also an irreplaceable source of immediate energy for muscles and other tissues, so much so that enhancing your ability to process lactate can improve you race times rather dramatically.\\" In other words, lactate is produced in the muscles, removed to the blood, and reused by other tissues in the body or returned to working muscles. This process of creation, removal, and reuse is known as the lactate shuttle. Hence, raising LT isn't just a matter of delaying lactate production, it's also a matter of clearing lactatefrom the blood when it appears.<br />It's an ironclad law of physiology that the further above LT you go, the sooner your exercise session will end. The obvious question, of course, is how do you improve LT. Anderson provides us with a bevy of workouts verified by recent research from exercise physiology labs around the world. Too numerous to list here (you'll have to read the book), most involve running at, above, or well above LT. This will be unwelcome news the junk-mileage crowd, who steadfastly cling to the notion that plodding endless miles will somehow make them faster. For the rest of us, the avalanche of scientific research produced since the late 1980s is clear and convincing. Intensity trumps volume. Speed matters at all distances. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) is nearly impossible to improve in experienced endurance athletes. LT, on the other hand, can be improved in almost everyone, sometimes dramatically. These are the sound scientific principles that animate the pen of Anderson and make Lactate Lift-Off truly valuable resource.	2001-12-28

The exercises it recommends are very specific and very concrete, and there are clear and measurable criteria for their correct completion.  A simple reading of the text (without practicing the exercises) would almost necessarily be wholly unsatisfactory and even frustrating.  Large numbers of startling inferences can be made from reading the text.  However, only through practice can the inferences be verified or denied.  Undoubtedly, many of the exercises recommended here are very difficult to achieve.  The great attraction of the book is that it outlines an obviously rigorous system of practice that may lead the practitioner to a greatly enlarged, enhanced, and integrated life.  Because I have only had the book a short time and my practice is not yet sufficiently intense, I can say almost nothing regarding whether the content is correct or not.  Only personal experience can really tell.  However, the whole system is so detailed, so sophisticated, and so potentially helpful that I would feel cheated in life if I didn't at least try it for myself.  It could, of course, be entirely wrong.  With something of such potential importance, I think it wise for each person to determine the truth or falsity of the claims personally.	2001-12-27

This circular argument closes the door on research of the real causes and obfuscates large sections of reality contradicting such a prejudice. It sinks into insignificance the entire cluster of causes, including the numerous misadventures that led to the Nazis seizing the power in 1933. It excludes from attention the harmless behavior of the majority of the population, the virtual absence of outbreaks of popular antisemitism even after the Jews had been outlawed by the dictatorial regime around 1936. (The Kristallnacht atrocities committed by plainclothes party soldiers precisely did not represent the \\"spontaneous wrath of the people\\" Goebbels' mendacious propaganda made them out to be; but compare the spontaneous lynchings of black citizens in the US South, which indicate what a really racist society is likely to do.) It sinks into oblivion the relatively fortunate situation of Jewish Germans before the Nazis (at least from 1871, when the German Empire was founded), as compared to their situation in other European or American countries.     This circular argument does nothing but create a general mistrust against all Germans, who then are observed suspiciously by everybody, to spy for \\"their cultural traditions\\" surfacing again, since the allegation is that the German traditions are to be rejected altogether. Not only is this unjust, but, by attempting to lock the catastrophe in the German history, Goldhagen is also playing down the real threat to human nature.    In reality, what the atrocities demonstrated, was not the expression of particular German traditions, but the breach of the varnish of civilization over man as beast in the perpetrators, and the breach of all cultural traditions. Not for nothing did the Nazis' propaganda scream out against \\"Humanitaetsduselei\\". They wanted that breach. Such breaches of culture can happen elsewhere, too, and have happened elsewhere.     Goldhagen further fails on account of bad sociological method. Starting from singular cases like the well known crimes of the Hamburg police battalion, who perpetrated mass executions against Jews behind the Eastern front during the Second World War, he concludes that the entire German people (80 million) would have been prone to commit the same mass murder at any given moment. Such a farfetched conclusion would not be permissible, on account of the absolutely special situation these perpetrators were in, amidst the brutalization of an extremely brutal war, even if the total German population for whom the conclusion is supposed to hold were still completely present; even less permissible is such a farfetched conclusion for a historical situation where most of the Germans active and in positions of responsibility around 1943 are no longer alive, and the result can in no way be verified.    On a third count, Goldhagen fails because of his unclear, nay, often, ludicrous, rhetoric. The way he uses his phrase \\"eliminationist antisemitism\\" e.g., it might be used for too large a number of things, starting with the expression of a mild discomfort with some Jews to the industrially organized genocide itself. Though no expression of racism is harmless, this is over-extending the term; at a more precise look, this key expression of Goldhagen's is virtually empty and explains nothing about German society.    The question how the catastrophe could happen, what it implies about the Germans in particular and for mankind in general, is still open.	2001-12-23

Apparently, he thought I would run straight to church upon completing it. Well, I skipped over the boring parts (which was most of it) and went straight to Drosnin's amazing discovery. I knew there was something wrong with Drosnin's code, but not being a mathematician or statistician, I was unable to quite put my finger on it.  It seemed to me as if the people using the code were manipulating it to yield the results they wanted.  Like a street hustler would in a shell game.    So, I used the same computer technology that \\"enabled\\" Drosnin to discover the extant of the \\"prophetic\\" powers of his code to find rational antidotes to this obvious hogwash. I got on the world wide web and found several good and rational refutations of Drosnin. Keith Devlin, Dean of Science at St. Mary's College in Moraga, California was the nicest and most generous of Drosnin's opponents.    Despite the fact that Drosnin has claimed that mathematicians have verified that he is onto something he cannot name one.  I then tried to prove his point for him and found nothing to support this claim. To the contrary, what I found was mathematicians who said that it is no surprise that the Hebrew Bible spells words when you use a rather rudimentary and common encryption technique known as the \\"equal letter skip\\" It works like so: you start at the letter skip a fixed number of letters until you spell a word. Start with the first occurance of the letter \\"t\\" (rather the hebrew equivilant) in genesis, skip 49 letters and you come to an \\"o\\", skip another 49 letters and you come up with the letter t another 49 and you get h. Marvel of marvels you have the Hebrew word for Torah spelled out in the Hebrew bible. Suprising? Not really. In fact, it is to be expected. Just as mathematical probability says that if you flip a coin enough times, you are going to get 3 heads in a row, or 4 tails in a row. It just isn't surprising or even interesting: when you are allowed to pick the number of letters you can skip and you search through all of the thousands of verses of the Bible for pronouncable words, you are far MORE likely to find words, by several orders of magnitude, than you are to NOT find words.    The paragraph above is paraphrased from Devlin's interview on NPR the year after The Bible Code came out. According to Devlin, the odds are \\"extremely high\\" that Drosnin would find apparent messages in the OT, just as he and other mathematicians found the exact same messages imbedded in Moby Dick and War and Peace.  An engineer friend of mine (you may be aware that engineers have to take math and stats classes ad nauseum) said that the only way that this would be a newsworthy event is if they DIDN'T find pronouncable words and phrases in the Torah.  In that case, they would have beaten astronomical odds.    Drosnin wrecked his credibility by challenging skeptics to find seemingly prophetic words in other works of literature, and they did. Moby Dick revealed all of the same things, and other things that the Bible did not. They used Drosnin's software on an issue of the Wall Street Journal in which the word \\"Torah\\" appeared over 15,000 times. They also ran the Old Testament through Drosnin's software and found that the Bible states that the \\"CODE IS BUNK\\" and \\"DROSNIN FRAUD\\".  The Hebrew Torah also yeilded \\"DARWIN WAS RIGHT\\" (my personal favorite).    The final nail was hammered into the coffin of Drosnin's credibilty when he appeared on NPR saying that he didn't even believe in God, but rather believed that extraterrestrial aliens put the encoded predictions and prophecies in the Hebrew Bible.    Please.	2001-12-13

On the one hand, there are &quot;gender&quot; feminists who fabricate data, blame men for almost every ill, and have an uncanny ability to interpret almost anything as oppression of women.

Scholarly yet accessible, author Dr. Alvin J.

Through real-life historically verified stories and instances, the &quot;Good News&quot; is convincingly shown to have been truly good.<br />One cannot read Tacitus's description of early Christians experiences in the Roman Empire which Dr. Schmidt cites without gasping in wonder at their fervent faith: &quot;Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt to serve as nightly illumination&quot;. The lesson: Christians who don't live for this world should be the best at transforming it for the better (as the Church did with ancient Rome).   <br />In the book of Colossians, the Apostle Paul writes &quot;All things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.&quot; To see Christ incarnated in human lives and institutions is the major achievement of &quot;Under the Influence: How Christianity Transformed Civilization&quot; (a clever title that &quot;transforms&quot; the common term of &quot;Under the Influence&quot; from a drunk driving inference to a highly persuasive and winsome connotation.)      <br />In reading this book, I sensed Dr. Schmidt's strong &quot;Sociological&quot; perspective (he is a retired Sociology professor). Sociologists are trained to see the &quot;whole&quot; of issues (i.e. society). In the book's instance, such an approach provides a context in understanding many of the facets (religious,historical, scientific, political/legal, economic, psychological, familial/sexual, and artistic etc.) implications of the Christian message and how this message influencedthe day-to-day lives of those who have lived during Christianity's tenure (which sadly is passing). <br />I have a few  caveats about the book. Occassionally, Schmidt seems to ascribe Christian beliefs to influential figures in history where such conviction of these indidividual's is questionable (Issac Newton is a good example). While Schmidt acknowledges that Isaac Newton's orthodoxy has been questioned by some, I don't think he has come to grips with the contrary evidence. Schmidt suggests that figures such as Newton, Da Vinci, and others of this questionable faith ilk, still were heavily influenced by Christian though and values. <br />Another caveat I have about the book is that Schmidt does not really ask and answer where we go from here as Christians. It is an important step to understand Christianity's high beneficent history (credit should go to Dr. Schmidt in that he does not whitewash Christendom's practical failures to live up to the ideals of Christ). But, where do we go from here is a essential question that must be addressed, perhaps in a future book. <br />Finally, Schmidt's critique of rock and roll music was surprisingly weak. He acknowledges in the book that music is not his forte. His lack of musical understanding, combined with a legalistic aversion to the rock beat, came across to me as being unconvincing (and) ignores the fact that rock and roll orignated in the Christian community through both Negro Spirituals and Anglo-American folk music that draws from hymns such as Amazing Grace. The fact that Rock and Roll is a genre that has been torn so successfully from its Christian base and conformed into an demonic den for licentiousness and rebellion, would seem to me to be a good reason for it to be reformed and returned to its rightful progenitor; the Church. I would assert this should be true for all of the Arts. <br />In conclusion, that Christianity transformed civization for the better is historically documented beyond a doubt by this tome.That Christianity can still &quot;transform&quot; culture seems to be a thesis &quot;Left Behind&quot; by Schmidt (this coincidence is intentional. The best-selling books in the Chrisitian marketplace today, the LaHaye/Jenkins series, postulate that Christianity will no longer produce culturally significant advances). <br />Do not leave this book behind. There is much to consider. By truly understanding Christianity's rich historical legacy may we capture a vision for her glorious future.	2001-12-08

Unfortunately I was quickly disappointed.  To begin with, the book puts forth opinions which cannot be historically verified.  To ape the pro-Roman stance that the 2d Punic War was a direct result of the Barca Family and its hatred of Rome, while intriguing and romantic, is not supported by any reliable sources.  Polybius &amp; Livy are informative but are not in themselves definitive.  The bottom line is, we don't know the exact cause of the war, and any assumptions are purely speculation.  Responsible historians and authors should say as much, not write as if the events of 2500 years ago are clearly understood.  The other problem I have with the book is the editing, or lack thereof.  Example, the phrase &quot;must have...&quot; is used seven times between pages 92-93.  This is just one example of repetative phrases used time and again in the writing.  I get the impression that no one sat down and took the time to proof-read the manuscript in an effort to make the narrative flow.  If you are looking for a balanced, well-written account of this epic march across the Alps, this is not it.	2001-12-04

(Nutshell Handbooks)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Good for instruction but buggy examples	I recently purchased the 8/01 printing of this book. I did so after a quick scan of the book. My decision was heavily based on the fact that it's publish by O'Reilly, a company I had come to trust for accuracy.  The code examples in this book begin to make me question that trust.<br />Don't get me wrong, the author is very clear in conveying the given topics, and for that alone the book is worth purchasing. However, the book is riddled with errors in the example code. In some cases the errors are intentional and corrected later as part of the lesson. Many others have been reported to O'Reilly, but appear to have gone unchecked. The current errata page for this book is quite long and was last updated (8/15/01 as of this writing) during the same month as the printing I have. However, O'Reilly still has these glaring errors classified as unverified.<br />Overall the book has been a wonderful learning tool, but you must take the source with a hefty grain of salt, and make your first stop O'Reilly's errata page.	2001-12-01
US	49773108	R21X3P2HVDBXR6	0879758899	227319347	Porphyry's Against the Christians	Books	2	82	110	N	N	Unusual text, but could do with better editing	While many of Porphyry's works were copied in Christian times, and Christians were generally interested in Neoplatonism, his work in 16 books rubbishing the Christians is lost. Works calculated to annoy both readers and copyists have few chances to survive. It was condemned as a mischievous libel by Constantine, without much effect, and again by Theodosius (448AD). The refutations by Apollonius, Methodius and Eusebius are sadly also lost. However fragments exist in various works by the church fathers, about half of which come from the Apocriticus of Macarius Magnes, preserved in a single 15th century MS (now lost). These are the fragments presented here.<br /><br />The book isn't aimed at the specialist - the issues of dating, the MS tradition (less info than in this review!), the many philological issues with the text are not addressed, and footnotes are only for the translation, and mostly simply summarise Macarius' response. However references to the Apocriticus are given (an improvement on the same author's Celsus).<br /><br />There is a rather pointless essay occupying the second half of the book, which the author admits is not for specialists and has not a single footnote. The introduction is unsatisfactory - for instance it does not even list the works of Porphyry. On the first page the quote from Tertullian from Ad Scapulam (title not given but obvious) is inaccurate; the lack of footnotes makes it hard to check others.<br /><br />The translation is very crisp, and much the best part of the book. It is not always very accurate. For instance he translates \\"The evangelists were fiction-writers - not observers or eye-witnesses to the life of Jesus\\" (p.32) where the Greek (and Crafer) says \\"The evangelists were inventors, not historians of the events concerning Jesus\\" (p.38, Crafer, p.20 of Blondel's text). Hoffmann's version suggests they were not eye-witnesses, and consequently he can make no sense of Macarius' reply. The correct translation allows us to see that 'Porphyry' has no opinion on this - a 20th century idea - but just says that their accounts are invented.<br /><br />I had wondered whether the book was worth doing. It is hard to imagine a series of reconstructions of lost anti-semitic literature being made. But somewhat to my surprise, it does have a contribution to make - a definite picture of the nature of Porphyry's work emerges, which makes it plain why it no longer exists.<br /><br />The arguments of Porphyry will appeal to Christian-haters - apparently the target audience (in the first couple of pages of the introduction almost every statement by a Christian writer is labelled a 'boast' or 'brag'). Porphyry's method is to highlight by pretending an 'idiot-boy' obtuseness to what used to be called quaintly 'bible difficulties'. A few pages of this will be enough for most readers, other than the anti-Christian believer.<br /><br />But the power of the work lay in its silent appeal to the embarassment at being different that any minority feels in a society that does not share its values. He sneers at Christian respect for the poor, for instance. Frequently he does not argue - merely assert that such an attitude is shameful. Of course once times changed, this process worked in reverse, and his appeals to the shibboleths of a vanished society were at best meaningless, and the obtuseness embarassing even to his admirers in Christian Greece. This then is the real reason the work had power, and why it is lost.<br /><br />This book suffers because the editing is not up to standard, and the statements made are usually undocumented and too often have not been verified. I missed any discussion of the many interesting problems of philology posed by the text. It would have been nice if Hoffmann had gone to look for the MS, as I suspect it is only lost because no-one has seriously searched.<br />It is always nice to see a new version of any ancient work, even if a popularisation like this, particularly for so obscure awork as the Apocriticus.<br />Note: This text has not been considered an academic work by the scholarly community; it is not listed in the academic bibliography l'Annee Philologique, and so I  presume was not reviewed by any academic journals.	2001-11-28

Nasr's book &quot;Arab and Israeli Terrorism: The Causes and Effects of Political Violence, 1936-1993&quot; attempts to examine precisely the causes and effects of Arab and Israeli terrorism by carefully describing many of the political factions and their guerilla actions in the Middle East. The blowing up of embassies, the airplane hijackings of the 1960s, and especially the rise of Abu Nidal are thoroughly covered, as are many other incidents in the region. Attention is given to the futility of counter-terrorism, showing how the direct response to these attacks was the inspiring of more terrorist recruits, which lead to the growth of guerilla movements. <BR>     This book begins describing Zionist terror against the British during its occupation in the 1940's and further describes Zionist terror against Palestinians.  Terror groups like the Stern, Irgun, and Hagana were intended to erode the morale of the British army and make Palestine unsafe for British personnel, &quot;staging a new precedent in the world of international terrorism&quot; said the Sunday Times.  They also blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, masqueraded as Arabs.  Nasr implies that Israelis masquerading as Arabs in fact played out many terrorist activities of which suspicion fell on Palestinians. There were dozens of incidents against the British but Israeli terror groups also systematically targeted Palestinians.  The massacres at Deir Yassin and Kufr Kassem village are only two tragic examples of Israeli terrorism. In the words of the Irgun leader, Menachem Begin, &quot;The legend of terror goes before a fighting force and wins.&quot;  <BR>     Nasr goes on to describe the various Palestinian factions such as the PLO and Fatah, and the terrorist activities of the PFLP, and the NAY.  He concentrates on the PLO's inability to control the terrorist activities of its group, and suggests that some of these activities were in fact played out by the Mossad, the Israeli secret service.He mainly associated the PFLP and the NAY with numerous airplane hijackings.  However Nasr focuses on the leader of the NAY, Abu-Nidal, and his anti-PLO group, the FRC.  He unravels the connection Abu-Nidal must have had with the Mossad.   Abu Nidal has never attacked Israel and Israel has never raised a hand to the FRC. In fact, Abu Nidal actually confessed that he had Israeli agents in his organization. Is any more evidence needed to prove that the Mossad infiltrated the FRC?   Abu Nidal put all his effort in the assassinations of the most effective and intellectual leaders of the PLO, the same type the Mossad killed. <BR>     Nasr has done well in analyzing the causes and effects of Arab and Israeli terrorism by examining the various political entities.  The possibility of this book suggests that if it were not for Abu Nidal and the Mossad, the PLO may have prevailed.  &quot;Abu Nidal and the Mossad assassinated those who were most fluent, most able to interact with Europeans and present the case of Palestine, and who could have positively influenced PLO decisions.&quot;  Additionally, Nasr promotes various examples of Israel's ability to find many Arab &quot;traitors&quot; to assassinate fellow Arabs.  But were Arabs able to find Israeli traitors to assassinate fellow Israelis?  This book does not suggest that.  Rather it suggests disunity amongst the Arabs.  Are they helpless? Will they ever over come this inner-rivalry?  Furthermore, Nasr discredits some alleged Palestinian terror attacks by calling on Israeli use of Arab disguise.  Nevertheless, he does raise a particularly good question. &quot;If we look at the pattern of verified Arab masquerade incidents, then we have to call into question how Zionism, which was not a popular movement in the Arab Jewish communities, quickly attracted hundreds of thousands.&quot; The truth behind these immigration movements remains hidden.   What's more, one could suggest that Nasr's book lacks objectivity by its continuous implication that many PLO leaders who were assassinated, such as Kamal Adwan and Kamal Nasser, were not who the Israelis claimed them to be just because they preached for &quot;negotiation and compromise&quot;.  Nasr low bashes Israel for using deception yet does he not think that Palestinians are capable of the same sort of deception?  Moreover, it is appealing to learn the fact that in their activities, Palestinian terrorists typically demanded the release of prisoners, like Abu Daoud from Jordan, which shows how important individuals are in the Palestinian struggle.  This book contains many personal stories about these political groups and consists of primary information from leaders involved in these groups.  Nasr's study has been worthwhile by providing significant information and events in his book without overly rehashing the evident history of terrorism in the Middle East. The information that Nasr presents regarding Abu Nidal has enhanced my knowledge in the particular interest of Arab terrorism and the significant contribution Abu Nidal has made to the validation that rests in the phrase Palestinian terrorists. <BR>     Nasr explains that it would be rash to conclude that terrorists get their way.  &quot;Israeli terrorism may have achieved its short-term goal of territory but did not fulfill the Zionist dream of a successful socialist state. &quot;They won it all, but they never enjoyed it.  &quot; And of coarse, Palestinian terrorism didn't win a square inch of land or unite the Arab countries to fight on their behalf.&quot;  Another certain conclusion is that counter terrorism and reprisals only raised the level of conflict and escalated radicalization of the opposition.  &quot;The bombing of Lebanese villages for the Munich Olympics or bombing Tripoli for Abu Nidal terrorism does not represent justice but increases the conflict.&quot;   It can even be concluded that American belligerent policy accelerated terrorism.  The US collaboration with Saudi Arabia arranging the bombing outside a Shia mosque against Sheikh Fadlallah could have been the reason behind the staged suicide bombing on the Battalion Headquarters Building, killing 240 US marines.  Providing a historical overview of terrorism in the Middle East, this book shows how terrorism has generally failed as a means to reach a political objective in the region.	2001-11-21

Specifically:<br /><br />#1) Archaic language has been replaced by present usage (few currently know what \\"trow\\", \\"wot\\", etc. mean.)<br /><br />#2) Some words have changed in meaning since the early 17th century. For example, \\"conversation\\" no longer means \\"conduct or behavior\\" and \\"let\\" no longer means \\"to hinder\\". Modern usage is now reflected.<br /><br />#3) 1611 sentence & word formation were different than now. While \\"you\\" had recently come into use, \\"thee\\", \\"thou\\", \\"thy\\" were still common. These currently hinder modern understanding and have been replaced in the MKJV.<br /><br />#4) Some KJV translations were inadequate, as recognized subsequently. Stricter translations that have been suggested over the centuries, based on the original language, are substituted. This is done on a word-for-word basis with the original and can be verified with a Hebrew/Greek lexicon dictionary. No change has been made without referring to the original Greek or Hebrew.<br /><br />#5) In spots where the KJV paraphrased, the original text has been restored.<br /><br />The Modern King James Version should be the version of choice for all Christians. Also recommended are the \\"Literal Translation\\" (total emphasis on literal translation at the expense of grammatical complexities) and the \\"Interlinear Version\\", by the same publisher, in which the original language text is shown with word-for-word translation underneath, the literal English translation at the side, all keyed to Strong's concordance so you can follow along and see the decisions the translator made.

Perusing the out-of the ordinary, but less than extraordinary words that compose the bulk of this work may elicit a few of them from the desuetude of the mind`s dormer.<br />Those who seek the urbaneness of truly offbeat words will find occasional examples, but as the title intimates, that is not the thrust of this work.  Still \\"deracinate,\\" \\"ennui,\\" \\"otiose,\\" \\"sang-froid,\\" \\"manqué,\\" and \\"hegira\\" are among the features of this congeries that would send quite a few erudite folk to the nearest dictionary.

The only definition Schur provides is \\"a living organism with both male and female organs of sex.\\" Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary expands the definition with \\"a person or thing in which two opposite qualitiesare combined' and \\"combining two opposite qualities.\\"  Both of these meanings seem likely to find more use than Schur's limited delineation which could only apply in very few instances beyond a description of Janet Reno.  Oversights like this confirm that all vocabulary building sources (...) should be verified in a reputed dictionary before the words are summoned perfidiously.	2001-11-15

I enjoyed several of these essays tremendously, including &#34;Radical, Conventional Mozart,&#34; and the piece on the problems with performing Carter's &#34;Double Concerto&#34; for piano and harpsichord.<br /><br />The essay &#34;The Irrelevance of Serious Music,&#34; though, is not only brilliant, but should be widely popularized.  The key is that Rosen writes from the perspective of the musician!  He emphasizes that musicians will play music they are inspired by, even if only for one another.  He presents many examples of music and musicians now established in the repertory that were initially rejected as &#34;too difficult.&#34;<br /><br />But he also argues that an attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator will not satisfy the serious listeners either -- they want to be challenged, at least up to a point.  The reductio ad absurdum of commercialism, of course, is to eliminate &#34;classical&#34; music altogether, as the market is too small for a huge corporation to justify.  (Rosen had a recording cancelled by Sony when he wrote a portion of this essay in the NYT criticizing the head of Sony for his obtuse commercialism.)<br /><br />Rosen concludes that &#34;[a] work that ten people love passionately is more important than one that ten thousand do not mind hearing.&#34;  Rosen provides support for my contention that books such as Libbey's &#34;NPR Guide&#34; do the public a disservice by excluding the leaders of the late 20th century avant-garde, including instead works that continue in the Romantic tradition.<br /><br /> In Rosen's essay on Beethoven, he critiques a book by a sociologist.  While I don't disagree with much here, I do think Rosen mainly takes on a strawman version of sociology.  In the introduction he criticizes &#34;[s]ociologists who believe that the history of music can be entirely elucidated by its social functions and the classes that support it without any reference to the music itself...&#34;<br /><br />What I think Rosen misses is that the very process he describes so eloquently, the process of musicians shaping the reception of advanced works, is itself sociological!

However, he is just plain wrong!<br />Don't get me wrong, I have a tremendous respect for Peter Marshall as a person.  However, as with my reviews of his previous two books in this series, I find many flaws.<br />Item:  (And this is technically not a flaw)  The authors, in order to move the flow of the book along, do so by means of dialogue.  This DOES have the advantage of making history come alive -- but the reader has to be alert that not all of the dialogue is historical, but rather based on what is known of the characters.  This is especially important for homeschooling parents (and I am one) so their children will understand the difference.<br />Item:  The authors tend to view American history filtered through their Calvinist theology.  Unfortunately, if one is not using a Calvinist lens, their conclusions are far less convincing.  It is quite true that many, many religious Americans in the 18th and 19th century WERE Calvinists; and it is equally true that many aspects of American civilization were highly influenced by Calvinist thought -- but there were other major influences as well, and these tend to be minimized.  With Calvinists no longer having nearly the prominent influence in American society as they did 150 years ago, the average reader will have difficulty making the paradigm shift necessary to fully understand the author's perspective.<br />Item:  One element which was NOT covered in this volume concerns the hideous persecution of Catholics in the United States -- by Calvinists, especially in the North.  The ideas of religious freedom which were part of the founding documents in our land were seriously compromised during the time period under consideration.  It is one thing to exercise one's right to criticize another belief system -- but many, MANY Calvinist clergy of that era crossed the line into outright hate-speech and deceit.  (The Beechers, for example).  In fact, the American Party (otherwise known as the &quot;No-Nothing&quot; Party) was a hotbed of anti-Catholic, anti-immigration American nativism.<br />Item:  This is the most serious.  The authors devote virtually all of the discussion of the causes of the Civil War to the single issue of slavery.  That is just not historically accurate.  (And I'm a conservative northerner!)  While slavery was AN issue, and certainly a &quot;hot button&quot; issue, it was BY NO MEANS the ONLY issue -- or even the FIRST issue.  The most significant issue concerned state's rights and the balance of power between the several states and the federal government.  Another issue was one of economics, and the radically different economic views held by the North as opposed to the South.  To play up the issue of slavery as THE issue just doesn't fly.<br />Item:  The issue of Lincoln's attitude toward slavery is problematic.  Yes, Lincoln was opposed to slavery.  Yes, he was opposed to the expansion of slavery.  However, his NUMBER ONE CONCERN, as is evidenced in his own writings, was the preservation of an intact Union, REGARDLESS of how the slavery issue turned out.  This can easily be verified merely by reading the various citations on the first floor of the Lincoln Memorial.<br />So there it is:  This is one conservative, northerner, Christian clergyman, homeschooling father who does NOT recommend this book as a primary text -- and frankly, I'm undecided on its value even as a secondary text.	2001-11-09

This is a collection of academic papers from a conference held at the University of Southern California in 1991.  Unfortunately they are mainly of no interest beyond specialists, and the book certainly does not live up to its ambitious and intriguing subtitle.  It might more accurately have been called &#34;Schoenberg and the Transformations of Musicological Hermeneutics.&#34;<br /><br /> The papers are divided into three sections -- Contexts, which looks at how Schoenberg was affected by his social context, Creations, which examines specific aspects of Schoenberg's music, and Connections, which looks at what effect Schoenberg had on the world.  The third section is where &#34;Transformations of 20th Century Culture&#34; might be identified -- how Schoenberg's atonality and serialism, revolutionary or purist or neoclassicist ideas affected modern culture -- but this is totally absent.  Instead we have insular examinations of Schoenberg from a postmodern standpoint.  Disappointing and dull.<br /><br /> The one excellent essay, by Leon Botstein, founding director of the Arnold Schoenberg Institute, is a fascinating look at Schoenberg's position in avant-garde intellectual circles in Vienna.  Botstein describes two rival factions, one centered on Gustav Klimt, and one centered on Karl Kraus.  Schoenberg was active in the Kraus circle, which &#34;believed in art as a profound instrument of ethical and moral transformation,&#34; saw that &#34;modernism needed to be a critique of culture,&#34; and advocated &#34;truth-telling&#34; as opposed to what it saw as the other faction's &#34;facile bohemianism.&#34;<br /><br />  Given Adorno's advocacy of Schoenberg, and given the retreat of much postmodernism into moral relativism and facile bohemianism, a book that truly addressed the effect of Schoenberg and the Second Vienna School on 20th century culture would be well worth reading!<br /><br />(verified library loan)	2001-11-05

It is science at its best.  Joseph definitely thinks &quot;outside the box.&quot; He frees us from the chains of conventional wisdom which piously proclaim that life emerged from an organic soup, and that it evolved randomly, or that the Universe began with a &quot;big bang;&quot; that is, at first there was nothing and then a big explosion, what the author calls: &quot;The Nothing Happened Theory of Creation.&quot; In the first several chapters, the author explains the astrobiology, genetics and origins of life, and in the second half of the book, the genetics of evolution.  The author makes it convincingly clear that since a single cell and its DNA is so amazingly complex, it could not been manufactured in an organic soup on earth, particularly as all the necessary ingredients did not exist on this planet at the time life first appeared, which was following a 700 million year bombardment from outerspace.  Complex life, and its DNA must have hitchhiked to this planet.  Joseph points out that the &quot;seeds of life&quot; hypothesis was first proposed thousands of years ago.  Joseph, however, turns a hypothesis into a viable theory founded on DNA and the most recent research on genetics.  Life and its DNA must have first originated on other planets. Joseph then astonishes the mind by pointing out that since even the DNA of microbes contains human DNA (verified by findings from the Human Genome Project) the first microbes on earth may have also contained human DNA, and the genetic instructions for the creation of all life, including humans.  Joseph calls this theory, &quot;Evolutionary Metamorphosis,&quot; and then explains, and provides convincing evidence from genetics and the fossil record that does not just support his theory, but which refutes Darwin's theory. Thinking outside the box, Joseph takes the theory of evolution and revolutionizes it.  He explains that DNA acts on the environment, which acts on gene selection, to activate silent intronic genes which contain the genetic codes for the metamorphosis of all life.  After life arrived on this planet, its DNA began to genetically engineer the envionment, changing the environment, e.g., releasing oxygen, calcium, and so on,  all of which acted on gene selection to activate silent genes thereby giving rise to not just variable creatures, but more advanced forms of life, which in turn acted on the environment.  Evolution is therefore under genetic control, which explains why the emergence of increasingly complex and intelligent species has followed a predictable linear progression.  There is nothing random about genetic expression or evolution.  This theory, evolutionary metamorphosis, is truly revolutionary, and clearly, it is well ahead of its time; and because it is ahead of its time, and because it is revolutionary and overturns conventional wisdom, most people, including most scientists, are going to resist these idea and the facts, clinging instead to the myths they have grown accustomed to. This is an intelligent, astonishing book. The  author is also a world renowned neuroscientist and evolutionary neurobiologist, and probably stands alone as one of the few &quot;experts&quot; with a genuine understanding of the biology, genetics, and environmental foundations of life and evolution.	2001-11-04

Three of the mutilation examples have a sexual context and are pretty gross.<br /><br />If you find fatal and grisly mishaps funny, you will enjoy the book greatly. In fact, this has to be the best articulated book ever written about stupid ways to die and lose fertility. Anyone will feel smarter and better about themselves after reading these stories!<br />This book is about people \\"removing themselves from the gene pool in sublimely idiotic fashion\\" in &#8220;true accidental blunders.&#8221;  The incidents involve ways that people &#8220;unthinkingly engineer their own downfalls, oblivious to warning signs that the rest of us automatically heed.&#8221;<br /><br />The book's premise is very well framed to put you in a humorous mood. The idea is that when people do stupid things that get them killed or keep them from having children, they thus perform a service by improving the gene pool for the remaining humans. Ms. Northcutt uses many witty essays and quotes to emphasize this point, and establishes the mood well.<br />She has rules for these awards. To win the Darwin Award, you must (1) die or be unable to procreate after the incident, (2) show &#8220;an astounding misapplication of common sense,&#8221; (3) cause your own downfall, (4) have the ability to use sound judgment (are not too young or permanently mentally impaired) and (5) have the incident verified by someone else. If you don't meet all these tests, you can still get an honorable mention, or be described as an urban legend or a personal account. I thought these distinctions made good sense, because the story's focus and credibility weighs heavily on the interest it creates for the reader drawn to this subject.<br />In an improvement over The Darwin Awards, Ms. Northcutt has shared feedback from her readers challenging the veracity of various urban legends, personal accounts, and honorable mentions.  As a result, this book is tighter than The Darwin Awards.<br />In another improvement, the stories much more carefully document the victim&#8217;s involvement with illegal drugs and alcohol than in The Darwin Awards.

Almost all of the examples came from 1998-2001, so there were not as many examples to choose from.  I also think the verification process needs some further work.

A wonderfully bibliographed text which will assist any thesis, essay, term paper or legal presentation on the subject of women's unpaid service and poverty.  This poignant, exceptionally well-written and throughly  documented book is a must for many audiences:1) anyone who is preparing for divorce (despite what the income or attorney promises,2) children of divorce who want to know why the once vibrant mom can't seem to get back on top financially,3) for anyone with disabled children, 4) for any men who view women and children as people, and for any legislator/senator or policy maker/agency manager who still has a conscious, some backbone and believes that when good men are silent wickedness prospers.4) This is must reading for students of sociology, psychology, women's studies, government and policy.  We are in 2001 yet millions of our own women and children are living in conditions similar to those of poverty in Charles Dicken's time.  This tragic, hidden, American secret is silenced with the anti-welfare propaganda. There are many women and children who fall from prosperity to poverty despite all attempts to &quot;pull up their bootstraps, keep their nose clean,&quot; and frugal living.  For me this was a book which validated the nightmare I've lived falling from apx $300,000 annually to homelessness-even thoughy the court ordered the Doctor otherwise.  This was a sanity break, as document after document verified this typical sturalization of poverty for women. It depersonalized the experience and gave me the extra boost to complete my education to fly over poverty coop to hope and resiliance.  5) This is a very valuable book for any friend recovering from economic disaster and emotional devastation of children as a result.   High risk children are produced by patriarchal protection and inequality in legal representation. The greatest gift we can give our children is to respect their mother by valuing her unpaid labor and insuring food, shelter, health insurance, electricity are provided for those who give nurturing service to the nations greatest treasure- healthy, safe, confident,educated,children with compassion to make a positive difference.     A most wonderful book!  A tribute to all who care for the aged, work with spouses, bear and serve children.  Great reading.	2001-10-23

Sadly this is not the case. First of all nowhere in this revised edition is it stated real-world testing of the various paint brands and pigments was re-done. Since the book was first published practically every watercolor manufacturer has revamped their line to offer more lightfast and permanent pigments. Nowhere in this book did I see evidence of new testing and a lot of information is out-dated. Quite a few brands that don't exist anymore are still included. For example, the U.S. corporation Colart Americas, Inc. (owners of Liquitex since year 2000 [and now also the owner corporation of famed Winsor &amp; Newton!], quit making Liquitex watercolors years ago in order to focus that brand more on the acrylic market.<br />The guide states no evaluation of any companies' brands of student grade watercolors was done - only artist grade paints are covered. But here's an example of why I'm suspicious of the testing claimed by this book - I bought some DaVinci watercolors based on the praise they received in the book and immediately noticed the brand is &quot;student grade&quot; in quality. The filler used is so high that the chalky appearance of the watercolor squeezed out onto my palette is visible to the naked eye once its had a few minutes to begin to dry. It doesn't have any clarity or beauty of my Winsor and Newton, Daniel Smith or Holbein watercolors. If you wish to see it for yourself merely buy a single tube of DaVinci watercolor, squeeze out some onto your palette, mix a small puddle of the paint with water then let the puddle of paint dry a bit. You will see exactly what I'm talking about. If visible-to-the-naked-eye chalky filler doesn't shout &quot;student grade paint&quot; I don't know what does.<br />Another note about DaVinci watercolors - Mr. Wilcox has contracted the DaVinci company to supply the watercolor paints used in his own paint brand for the School of Color correspondence color mixing course. Nowhere in the guide does he disclose this commercial arrangement with the DaVinci paint company. I think it only fair that artists should be made aware of this fact in a guide that posits itself as an un-biased guide to watercolor brands.<br />I also found his constant harping on &quot;gummy&quot; paint odd. Since I like to be able to control the runny-ness of my paint I don't see thick-or-thin-ness of paint out of the tube as a problem. How difficult can it be to simply add water or ox gall medium anyway? And what does &quot;gumminess&quot; have to do with the lightfastness of the paint being discussed - which is the main thing this book claims to be handing out grades on?<br />Given these flaws - inaccurate information, very out-of-date information and less than un-biased reporting I can not recommend this book for watercolorists in good conscience. A better book is Hilary Page's Guide to Watercolor Paints. Furthermore, she explains exactly how she conducted her tests and under what conditions. An added bonus is that she tries to keep the book current by giving regular updates on new pigments, new watercolor brands or reformulations of existing brands on her website. It's really sad that I give such a low mark to Wilcox's Guide to Best Watercolor Paints. If the author took the time and effort to conduct tests similar to what Hilary did it could be a great resource.

And what does &quot;gumminess&quot; have to do with the lightfastness of the paint being discussed - which is the main thing this book claims to be handing out grades on?<br />Given these flaws - inaccurate information, very out-of-date information and less than un-biased reporting I can not recommend this book for watercolorists in good conscience. A better book is Hilary Page's Guide to Watercolor Paints. Furthermore, she explains exactly how she conducted her tests and under what conditions. An added bonus is that she tries to keep the book current by giving regular updates on new pigments, new watercolor brands or reformulations of existing brands on her website. It's really sad that I give such a low mark to Wilcox's Guide to Best Watercolor Paints. If the author took the time and effort to conduct tests similar to what Hilary did it could be a great resource. What a wasted opportunity....	2001-10-22

I bought this book at a tournament a few years ago without really looking it over first, and was surprised recently to find it offered by a supplier like Amazon.  I noticed many of the same problems the last reviewer did, and although I understand that it isn't politically correct to criticize people in the martial arts, especially teachers or those calling themselves 'master', being a teacher myself, I will be honest without being rude.<BR>   <BR>   While some of the techniques in this volume can be applied effectively by the average person, there are many impractical ones included in this volume as well.  Technique wise, I would give it two to three stars.  But overall, reviewer M.C. Busman below has a valid point with asking why the huge kanji mistakes on the cover and why the claims of tournament victories and studying with masters in Japan that cannot be verified by Irving Soto.  I did not find his stories about sudying with a Japanese master or winning a huge number of tournaments believable either (a la Frank Dux, almost), he just made too many mistakes and said too many things in this book which make absolutely no sense about Japanese martial arts and culture.  He is wrong on many points regarding custom, how he studies and got his rank, and so on.  I also noticed that there are no pictures of the man he says he learned from in Japan, or Author Soto himself in Japan. This also strikes me as very suspicious, and has planted strong seeds of doubt regarding his veracity.<br />   That having been said, I question the motives of Irving Soto as a teacher and writer.  So many things claimed by Soto in this volume don't make any sense no matter how hard you squint at them with an open mind.  For what I received (this book), I do feel that I greatly overspent my money.  Had I taken the time to glance through this book first, rather than blindly trusting someone who told me he was a master, I probably would not have bought it.	2001-10-22

The author pieced together this story from a variety of sources; he had been a diplomatic correspondent and foreign editor.<br />Th Potsdam Treaty carved up the world just like the Versailles Treaty after an earlier war. But unlike the latter, a new Cold War began (p.19). America shed its traditional isolationism and began its long march towards a New World Order - to replace and surpass the now declining British Empire.<br />The death and destruction in Eastern Europe fixated their leader's minds on security from another war. Their leaders were composed of two dissimilar type: those who spent years in underground activities (Tito), and those beholden to Moscow. It also included adventurers who joined the winning side, those with experience from the pre-war regimes, and some double agents.<br />Jan Masaryk said that Czechoslovakia's votes with Poland and Yugoslavia had not harmed the United States but benefitted Czechoslovakia by preventing Soviet interference there (p.26). But the Soviets demanded political support in return for noninterference in internal affairs, and America demanded political support in exchange for aid. Can a servant serve two masters?<br />Page 30 makes two mistakes in talking about disbanding the OSS by Truman, and a decoding organization by Stimson. The former was due to bureaucratic struggles within government, the latter to drop a high-cost unofficial group. You can be sure the regular agencies continued with this work!<br />Page 37 tells of the activities of &quot;Michael Sullivan&quot;, the head of a British relief agency who set up a spy network in Poland. Prisoners were extracted, incidents of sabotage and terrorism were created, rumors of shortages created runs on shops, rural riots were created by rumors of collectivization. In 1945 agents incited anti-semitic riots in Kielce and Krakow. The purpose of all this was to create a revolution; it failed. But he recruited the deputy director of Department Ten (Jozef Swiatlo), whose function was to police the policemen of the police state; it had unlimited powers.<br />The devil in all these details was Allen Welsh Dulles, grandson and nephew of Secretaries of State, senior partner of the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and head of the OSS mission in Berne during World War II. From 1946 to 1948 Allen Dulles ran private intelligence operations in Eastern Europe, using funds from companies and the wealthy (page 53 does not list their special interests). Like his brother John he was involved with a number of religious and charitable institutions which were used to cover and conceal their secret activities.<br />Dulles chose to use Noel Field as a pawn to taint national Communists as US spies, ensuring their destruction by Stalin. Dulles would use Swiatlo to help incriminate many with planted evidence (p.99). Evidence would show that Field recruited Communists as American agents, that others were followers of Tito or Trotsky. Stalin checked out these stories with their double agent in Washington - it was verified. But their double agent was a triple agent! Recruited in the 1930s, he was being saved for an event like this (p.101). To complete the deception, Dulles &quot;leaked&quot; the news that the CIA had agents in the Communist governments of Eastern Europe. The result was widespread investigations, purges, imprisonment, and executions. Years later the victims would be &quot;posthumously rehabilitated&quot;.<br />Didn't DeTocqueville once say that a regime is likely to be overthrown once it begins to liberalize its rule?<br />&quot;The Spy Who Came in From the Cold&quot; was a fictional story based upon this real incident. They made it appear that an important Eastern government official was a spy for the West in order to get him purged, and his rival promoted; but the rival was the real spy!	2001-10-19

Also H2 gas is 15x lighter than air, so there is a distinct difference in the mixing ratio/speed if it is released and can flow UP (top of the dirigible), versus the bottom where the heavier O2 would have kept it contained and poorly mixed.

American officials made a thorough investigation of the vessel in port to determine whether itcarried torpedoes, torpedo tubes, or deck guns. Within two days, it was announced that the submarine was truly a civilian cargo-bearing vessel, lacking armament, and would be treated like any surface merchant ship of a belligerent nation that entered an American harbor. This is contrary to the impression left by Fernicola that the government seriously considered detaining the boat permanently because it might be a warship. The author emphasizes the fact that she &quot;carried two small-caliber guns.&quot; not realizing that the Captain and officers of most merchant ships routinely carry on board small arms, especially during wartime.

If you ask someone to rate a book on a scale of '1' to '5', it is inevitable that if they even moderately like it, they will rate it a '5'.  If they moderately dislike it, it will rate a '1'.  Thus, you cannot trust a '1' or a '5' rating, as they are not truly representative of the book's worth. <br />With that said, this is why I have rated this book a '1', and why it is a valid rating.<br />Raymond Benson has written a James Bond character, without any of the characteristics of James Bond.  Benson's Bond lacks the sophistication, craftiness, and cunning seen in earlier Bond books.   Want to see the steel nerves of someone who faces death regularly?  Bond fidgets nervously under the gaze of his boss.  Want to see the subtlety of an undercover agent?  Bond races through an office building engaged in a running gun battle.  Which leaves the reader wondering: is this James Bond or T.J. Hooker?<br />But what about Benson's ability to create a believable scenario?  When a nuclear bomb explodes in Australia, Benson writes &quot;the device had roughly three quarters the power of the weapon that destroyed Hiroshima: approximately the equivalent of 300 tons of TNT.&quot;  Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was equivalent to 12-15,000 tons of TNT, not 400 tons as Benson implies.  Benson refers to the MACH-10 submachinegun.  The correct spelling is MAC-10.  These little tidbits take less than a minute to research on the Internet, so what's Benson's excuse?  It would appear that the reason Benson gave Bond back his old Walther PPK is because Benson is so unfamiliar with firearms (a hunch I consider verified with his book &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;), he didn't know what else to use.  Benson also falls for the Hollywood gimmick of where, no matter how severely injured the hero, it does not impair their ability to function later in the story.  *yawn*<br />As for Bonds shoes, here's a note for aspiring writers - themore you stuff into a small space, the smaller each item must be.  The number of items in the soles of Bond's shoes is laughable, making the items essentially unusable.  Come to think of it, the shoes themselves have lost a lot of their ability to function as shoes as well.<br />Reviewers comment that &quot;Benson should not be compared with Flemming&quot;.  I concur -- a writer should stand on their own merits, their own ability to spin a tale.  Benson, though, has not written a thriller in the tradition of James Bond, but rather of the likes of Mack Bolan or Dirk Pitt with the addition of frequent sex when the author can't think of some other ridiculous situation to throw at the main character.<br />Which is essentially the problem with this book.  Bond's name could be replaced by a half-dozen characters from other novels with no problem, and it would not detract from the story.  The spark that signifies Bond as a cut above the rest is simply not there, and we are left with a weak-willed, sex-starved hero that can't think his way out of a paper bag without a gadget from his Buster Browns.  And that is not how to write a Bond novel.	2001-10-16

Yet, amazingly, most of the contemporary rulings currently proceeding from that Amendment involve neither Congress nor the making of a law.  - David Barton.<br />Most books usually present their author and his credentials, but surprisingly, nothing can be learnt of David Barton from this third edition of *Original Intent*. I had to visit the publishers site to learn that he is a former  educator and school administrator  and the founder of Wallbuilders, a group whose purpose is  the restoration of the moral and religious foundation on which America was built . Barton is therefore neither an academic nor a professional lawyer, and his books are avowedly designed to give intellectual ammunition to the Religious Right.<br />Under its former title, *The Myth of Separation*, *Original Intent* was the object of a controversy that cast doubt on the reliability of Bartons scholarship : even though Wallbuilders pride themselves on the accuracy of their research, based on a library of  thousands of first-edition works of our Founding Fathers , Barton admitted that the book contained about a dozen erroneous or unconfirmed quotes, all of which were withdrawn from the present edition.<br />From these facts alone, it is easy to guess that *Original Intent* is not exactly the authoritative work that its serious-looking cover and its 184-page scholarly apparatus suggest.<br />Indeed, the book suffers from two major flaws. First, it is unfocused and poorly structured, as a simple glance at its table of contents will reveal. Divided into eighteen chapters, the book has no overarching argument and seems unable to stick to what its earlier title suggests is its main thesis : that the Founding Fathers erected no such thing as a  wall of separation  between Church and State, and that this wall is a modern creation based on the unconstitutional 1947 Supreme Court decision of *Everson v. Board of Education*.<br />And second, many of the arguments in the book are simply not cogent. Barton is guilty of many logical fallacies and his quotes, however numerous, are often irrelevant to the points he is trying to make. For instance, he reiterates an argument he made in another book, *America : To Pray or not to Pray*, that the victory of legal positivism and the rejection of Biblical Natural Law in the Supreme Court in the years 1962-3 is responsible for higher rates of crime and violent behaviour in the U.S., and a general decline in morality and educational achievement. Even though I do see the two phenomena as related, Bartons argument is simply a case of post hoc ergo propter hoc.<br />Instances of a faulty use of quotations can be found in Bartons use of extracts from eulogies to prove the virtue and piety of selected Founders and his repeated attempts to prove that the Founders held it to be a duty of a good government to support religion by accumulating quotes stating their belief that religion was the necessary support of good government.<br />Some of Bartons facts would also need to be verified. He says that Lockes First Treatise on Civil Government contains 1,349 references to the Bible, and the Second one, 157, while John Eidsmoes figures for the same books are 80 and 22 (*Christianity and the Constitution* p61.)<br />Despite all these flaws, I greatly enjoyed Bartons book and will probably keep it in my library. For if it fails cogently to support many of its specific claims, it does give a much better overall picture of the Founding Fathers positions than the politically correct, liberal volumes Bartons opponents would have us read instead. The selection of quotations and the conclusions reached by the online atheistic groups that deride Bartons scholarship are much more misleading than any of his fallacies, which never seemed to me to involve any outright dihonesty. In addition, whatever inaccuracies the book may contain, they will soon be corrected if the reader follows Bartons wholesome encouragements to read the primary sources of the Founding Era.<br />For a well-reasoned treatment of the opposite, separationist position, I would recommend Leonard Levys *The Establishment Clause* ; and, for a more logical defense of the same position, John Eidsmoes *Christianity and the Constitution*.	2001-10-09

Many experiments have demonstrated nonlocality, with one of the best performed by a French team headed by Alain Aspect of the Institut d' Optique Theorique et Appliquee.  Stenger admits that the team &quot;is probably right&quot; and then goes on to present his own dubious theory that tries to salvage every assumption of classical physics except determinisim.  Stenger holds the opinion that leading theorists such as Bohm, Schrodinger, Stapp, Josephson, De Beauregard and many others are all wrong.  Why doesn't he include in his book comments on his views from some of these theorists who disagree with him?<br />His motivation for attempting to remove nonlocality from QM is clear: &quot;At least this would put an end to mystical speculations about quantum mechanics demanding a holistic universe&quot; (page 197).<br />When he writes on subjects other than physics, his arguments are crude, unsophisticated, and display his ignorance.  For instance, &quot;psychic phenomena have failed to be verified after 150 years of attempts involving thousands of independent experiments.&quot; (page 289).  In the first place , the first sophisticated and systematic research only goes back to 1882 with the founding of the Society for Psychical Research, not 1845 (his book was written in 1995).  Postive results have been consistently obtained, but they have always been discounted by critics if the protocol was not 100% perfect, thereby allowing the possibility of a 'normal' explanation - such as fraud.  However, modern methods have become virtually foolproof, and combined with modern statistical techniques such as meta-analysis, they have obtained independently-replicated results with odds against chance of over ten thousand to one (see chapters 3-5 in The Conscious Universe by Dean Radin, additional sources listed there).<br />The only evidence Stenger offers for his narrow opinion is one-sentence reference to a highly-controversial 1987 report written by two arch-skeptics, psychologists Ray Hyman and James Alcock. For a balanced discussion of the Hyman-Alcock report, see Radin's book, pages 215-218.  If the new age goop in the bookstores needs to be balanced by Stenger's book, then Stenger's book needs to be balanced with far more sophisticated works like Radin's.

Scholarship at Low Point	Any book that elicits praises of &quot;bold&quot;, &quot;brave&quot;, or (from the Wall Street Journal) &quot;a sincere call to face the unpleasant truths&quot; should evidence rigorous and consistent scholarship.  This book fails, shamefully, on such a topic where both the left and right extremist views could stand a good, honest critique.<br />The only ugly truth here is the dependency on anecdotal evidence to carry the weight of sweeping pronouncements on the unique and, seemingly, wholly Black responsibility for the demise of this \\"race\\" of people.  An example:<br />A policeman stops the author as he crosses a street &quot;independent&quot; of the traffic signal. He is not wearing his &quot;normal Gap/khaki&quot; garb that is the mark of his Berkeley linguistics professor status.  Upon questioning from the policeman, he comes to understand that there was no cause of than suspicion driven by racial stereotype.<br />The author's analysis of this:  It is a shame that he was stopped, but even more of a shame that stopping him was NECESSARY.  Later, he assures himself that his high proficiency in spoken English was what got him out of further inquiry or trouble with the policeman. He notes that had he put on a \\"Black accent\\" he surely would have had a different situation.<br />This from a Berkeley professor is appalling as scholarship and leads down a path of anecdote vs. anecdote worthy of only another episode of &quot;Crossfire&quot; but far from real thought and debate.  Even in his field, linguistics, he fails critical tests.  In his policeman's example, he compares proficient English to Black English as mutually exclusive categories.  This leaves the opposite of Black English as White English???  Would Ma and Pa Kettle suffice here?<br />Staying with the policeman here, it is also simplistic and more than a bit blind to think that he saved himself with his English skills.  I do not think, judging from his writing, that he is anywhere near the caliber of W.E.B. Dubois, whose writing maintains an eerie relevance and long-verified objectivity. Yet, Dubois' English did not put him in good stead with the authorities.  Nor did ML King's.  Phyllis Wheatley, one of America's first writers of consequence, died in complete poverty, unable to support herself with her craft.  Enter John McWhorter??<br />Lastly, in this sociological work cum diatribe, he assumes the role of the preacher/leaders? he despises.  Most of his time is spent telling isolated stories and extrapolating those into 9 chapters of problems and 1 chapter of solutions.  He is his own Sharpton, Jackson, et al., the only difference being his conservative's robe.<br />If any topic needed honesty, clarity, integrity, and scholarship, it is this one.  Unfortunately, you won't find it here, not even in McWhorter's &quot;best English&quot;.	2001-10-01

These extremists are of the same caste as the Nazi whom Hoffer quotes as wanting to be &quot;free from freedom,&quot; and they worship a doctrine which they assume &quot;is a master key to the world's problems,&quot; a doctrine which will be neither intelligible nor verifiable, but which demands total self-sacrifice such that it can extend even to martyrdom. <br />According to Hoffer, all contemporary true believers &quot;whether Communist, Nazi, Fascist...&quot; deem that &quot;Western...democracies are old, corrupt and decadent&quot; and &quot;are no match for the virile congregations of the faithful who are about to inherit the earth.&quot; The author goes on to reveal the woeful consequences which fanaticism and mass movements engender.<br />The reader will understand before he moves very far along in this remarkable book, why Hoffer preceded the text of it with this quote from Genesis: &quot;And slime had they for mortar.&quot;<br />This longshoreman/philosopher has made a vital contribution to our heritage of liberty, and this work can serve as an essential introduction for all those who wish to understand the nature of fanaticism - the age-old enemy of freedom and of free people.<br />It is clear and concise; it can be read in just a few evenings. Add this treasure to your personal library and rest assured that it is even more relevant today then when it was first published, astonishingly, 50 years ago (1951).	2001-09-30

The Ka'ba is the most holy structure in Islam situated in Mecca, and is according to Islam the centre of the world. <br />There is a dispute in the book versus readers as to whether Jean Sassoon is the \\"Princess\\" herself in alter-ego.<br />The Desert Royal is a great read, and as a business visitor to Saudi Arabia, I find readings about the modern nation useful; there are few fact based books on the lives of Saudi's out in print in contemporary times.<br />I am responding to the specific charges that there are mistakes in the book \\"Desert Royal\\", per se, the description of the interior of the Ka'ba does in reality vary from the author's description. ... ...<br />I am not against the author, yet there are so many anti-Saudi books out in print, it would be a tragedy if Jean Sasoon \\"made the trilogy up\\", like so many other authors have in the past.<br />Personally well studied and somewhat traveled in the Kingdom, I quote this description of the Ka'ba; the following can be verified from any Islamic Encyclopaedia to support the facts versus the author's version of the interior of the Ka'ba.<br />The base of the Ka'ba is 10.5 x 12 meters, and it's 15 meters high, and is standing on a marble base which is 25 cm high. Each of the corners are pointing in the four directions of the compass. It is built of grey stones from the hills around Mecca.<BR>The door of the Ka'ba is in the northeastern wall, and is 2 meters above the ground. Inside the Ka'ba, three wooden pillars hold the roof up. The roof can be accessed by a ladder. The floor is covered by marble, and there are no furnitures, except gold and silver lamps.<br />Please compare this interior description with the author's account.<br />On the outside, in the corner east of the door and 1,5 meters above the ground, the Black Stone is found. This Black Stone is now in pieces, three large parts, and smaller fragments, which are tied together with a silver band. There are several theories on the origin of the Black Stone: ameteor; lava; or basalt. Its colour is reddish black, with some red and yellow particles. Its original diameter is estimated to have been 30 cm. There is another stone, too, built into the Ka'ba, in the western corner, the Stone of Good Fortune, which is far less sacred than the Black Stone. <br />This does vary with the author's description. Is the book \\"real\\"?<br />I feel other site details in Jedda, Riyadh and Taif are off, However, I am not a literary expert, pointing these things out is less useful.<br />Let's open a debate about this interesting discrepancy and see what becomes of it.

The resignation of Richard Nixon was my earliest political memory and ignited an interest in Watergate and politics in general that I carry to this day. I don't believe, as some do, that this was an effort to protect/redeem Richard Nixon, nor a conscious effort to discredit the Washington Post. Instead, as is usually the case, a true and objective historical perspective is not always clear amidst significant events(i.e. Kennedy Assassination, Gulf of Tonkin, Iran-Contra, Panama-Noriega, Kosovo, Columbia, our current World Trade Center tragedy). <br />It is my belief that Bob Woodward was the only reporter at the time of the Watergate break-in with the access to discover the story as it unfolded. Unfortunately, the source/sources of this information was limited. It is not a surprise, assuming Haig was Deep Throat, that there would be a certain spin to the Woodward &amp; Berstien coverage of the story. It is only after the passage of time and the publication of multiple biographies that we can begin to piece the entire puzzle together. <br />It is safe to assume that the whole truth will never be known, much less verified. What is unique about this Colodny &amp; Gettlin effort was the extensive and expansive interviews with most of the key players, the analysis of conflicting stories in so many biographies of the critical figures and the presentation of several versions of certain events(Dean vs. Liddy, Haig vs. Ford, etc). Whether you agree with the conclusions that are reached in Silent Coup, this book provides the broadest perspective on Watergate I have read to date.	2001-09-22

From the Pentagon Papers to Watergate, we've always been told the courage of the US media is something to imitate.<br />This book put me in some proper perspective. Halberstam's wonderful inside information, ranging from political pressure put on newspapers and the networks to squabbles among the press people themselves, avidly shows how limited American journalism was then, and by induction, how limited it probably is now. It mentions stories that were dropped not because they were not good or verified, but merely because some powerful figure in Washington, or worse yet a sponsor, chose to intervene. What to naive people might seem a scandal is shown here to be standard practice.<br />I heartily recommend this book. It's length (over a 1000 pages) can be intimidating at first, but not after you start reading - this is probably the most readable work I've come across, packed with information and yet never dull. While the scope of the book is limited (it was published in the 70s and does not go beyond Watergate), it is truly enlightening and mind-expanding, a must for anyone wishing to understand the media.	2001-09-17

On the author's Web Site[...], he claims that all the RMI example work fine - just keep trying(in FAQ).  Well, maybe they work fine between two UNIX machines but I really don't think he verified them between two Windose machines.

US	52009166	R1NTLGX9HLUUFZ	0879016140	77669944	Contemporary Economics	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Very readable example of standard neo-classical nonsense	The text by Spencer and Amos is a readable source of the misconceptions that are taught to students and believed by too many economists. This text is noteworthy in presenting a chapter on 'General Equilibrium Theory' (or 'Welfare Economics'), which explicitly exhibits misconceptions about the notion of stability of equilibrium. The book seems to have been written with a supply-side rather than Keynsian prejudice..<br />The text starts by defining 'capital' in such a loose way that trees, e.g., are defined as capital, which presumes a common 'value-judgement' that is accepted in the US but not always in various parts of W. Europe where there are remain some strong restrictions on the economic 'development' of farm and forest land. The 'curves' in the book, as in Samuelson, represent no dynamcs and are generally not derived from real data. Instead they are drawn representing expectations based on the typical incomplete misunderstanding of neo-classical theory that is pervasive in economics and finance, where the dynamics of that theory have not been worked out except under the most unrealistic assumptions. An example is the so-called 'Laffer curve' on page 347. From the beginning, e.g., equilibrium is presummed to be the normal state of affairs and it is assumed to be stable, in disagreement with real liquid market data. The quotes from the text and my commentary follow next.<br />\\"Is Perfect Competition a Fantasy?\\" (pg 536): \\" ..no, ... like the assumption of a frictionless state in physics..this assumption creates an idealized situation that permits simplification of a problem so that it may be analyzed.\\" This assertion represents a deep misconception. In physics we have real data, namely local motion in a gravitational field, where the assumption of force-free motion can be tested and verified as a good approximation (on the moon even better than on earth). Force-free motion is not merely a good approximation but lies at the foundation of physics. Economists and finance theorists have not understood this. The other side of the coin is that perfect competition, as defined in the text (requiring stable equilibria) does not exist in the world as a decent approximation to anything that occurs socio-economically.<br />From chapter 30 (pp 632-3) on General Equilibrium Theory: \\"Equilibrium was defined in earlier chapters as a state of balance between opposing forces. An object is in equilibrium when it is at rest. ... In economics \\"objects\\" may be prices, quantities, incomes, or other variables. You cannot consider a problem solved if, at the point you terminate your analysis, the variables are still changing. Only when the variables settle down to steady levels, or only when the future equilibrium positions can be predicted, can you consider the solution complete.\\" Unfortunately, no real economic data behave even approximately in this way. A data analysis can be 'forced' to approach equilibrium only by abandoning real data and replacing it by a wrong model with stable equilibria. Continuing, \\"The study of equilibrium is not an end in itself. Economics is concerned with understanding the forces that can disturb an equilibrium and the policy measures that may have to be undertaken to restore it.\\" Given that there are no stable equilibria in real economic systems, the assertion is meaningless in practice. Continuing with the text, on page 633 Exhibit 1 shows three figures, (a) a cone sitting upright on it's flat base, (b) the cone balanced perfectly on it's point, and (c) the cone lying on it's side. Figure (a) is compared with the authors' cartoon of a price vs quantity 'graph' showing the intersection of supply and demand curves as equilibrium. That is, the existence of the equilibrium point in the cartoon is advertised by the authors as 'stable', which of course is wrong. There is no implication of stability in the existence of any equilibrium point, a mistake that is sometimes made by freshman students in physics. The authors go on, \\" Figure (a) illustrates a case of stable equilibrium. this represents the normal situation. In physical terms, it may be depicted by a cone resting on it's base. In economic terms, it can be represented by the intersection of ordinary supply and demand curves. If the system is subjected to an external \\"shock\\" or disturbance sufficient to dislodge it from equilibrium, self-corrective forces will cause it to return to it's initial position.\\" Real markets never behave even approximately in this way. Whenever anything likeAdam Smith's hand can be found in the data, which is seldom, it is destabilized by noise. There are no equilibria, much less any stability in finance data, which are so far the best economic data available, for the most liquid markets. I define a liquid market is one where you can approximately reverse the trade over a short enough time scale, as in the stock market when it's not crashing.<br />Real data are shown in exhibit 5 on page 397, where meaningless 'Phillips curves' are illegitemately drawn through a terrible scatter of points that in reality cannot be represented by a curve at all (see also Ormerod's 'The Death of Economics').<br />The text repeats the usual misconception that utility maximization is an equilibrium condition. enough said.

However, when I found it featured in the library displays this week, I felt it was time to dig in. The good news is that I found the title less misleading after reading the book. The bad news is that I still found it misleading.<br />Dr. Barnard describes the workings of typical body functions that can influence the amount of fat you store and burn. There is some genetic influence involved in these functions, and you can influence the way the functions work. However, I don't think many people would argue that genes that affect the way we taste, experience hunger, build and burn fat, and oxygenate our muscles are all &quot;fat genes.&quot;<br />I was disappointed that in a book about dealing with fat that there was nothing said about drinking water. Studies have shown that not drinking enough water contributes to higher cholesterol levels. However, if you eat as many fruits and vegetables as are suggested here, your body's fluid sources should improve.<br />I did find it interesting that there were identified different ways that people taste based on genetics, which can be verified through testing. I suspect that it is really more complicated than that. Having been a consultant to food companies for many years, it seems clear that there are an incredible number of taste preference variations in any population.<br />The arguments about setting your metabolism by how many calories you take in seemed generally right. You can create a sense of starvation and your body will burn fewer calories. However, I suspect that this level is different for different people. All of my life, I have been able to lose four pounds a week by going to 1000 calories a day. Dr. Barnard would say that I could not lose that much on under 1500 calories a day. He would also say that my metabolism would stay low for weeks thereafter. I don't think my metabolism goes down at all. Well, Dr. Barnard, maybe for you . . . but not for me. He also argues that only dietary fat builds body fat. The argument is based on being able to identify the sources of fats consumed from the fat stored in the body. I don't think that clinches the case. I could go on with places where my own experience is different from what he describes in the book, but that might only establish that I am not average.<br />But I do think that that is an important point. None of us are average. Our own bodies are unique combinations of genes, preferences, and habits. I don't think this book takes that point seriously enough.<br />Now, what he describes is exactly the kind of diet that makes my Mother feel terrific. Coincidentally, she has a B blood type. When I read Live Right 4 Your Type, this sort of a diet was suggested for B blood type people. I wonder what blood type Dr. Barnard has.<br />I do agree that most diets push people to eat too much fat. I also think that the type of fat ingested matters from the books I have read (which this book doesn't take seriously enough). I also agree that almost everyone eats too little fiber and complex carbohydrates. So many of the book's directions are helpful to reinforce those points. I also appreciated the tables on glycemic index values, fiber, and fat for various foods (including popular fast foods).<br />The book's recipes will make you think differently about whether vegetarian food has to be boring. These are extremely imaginative recipes. For many people, the process of eating this type of food will take a little getting used to. I suggest that you try the ones that have higher sugar levels first.<br />After you finish reading this book, I suggest that you think about your own experiences with various kinds of foods, calorie levels, weight gain, and weight loss. Where have you succeeded? Where have you had problems? What haven't you yet tried? What blood type are you? How does the recommended diet for your blood type match with your experiences?<br />Let your own experience help guide you to better eating and exercise habits!ence help guide you to better eating and exercise habits!<br />	2001-08-30

To Summarize: No, there is no evidence that the mafia influenced Frank getting his breakthrough role in &quot;From Here to Eternity,&quot; no, there is no evidence that Frank was a member of the communist party, yes, there is some evidence that Frank had some casual contact with members of organized crime (as has EVERY major Hollywood star), yes, Frank and Kennedy partied together. This book is more of an indictment of Hoover's heavy-handedness as head of the FBI. They just kept digging and digging on Frank, but really found virtually nothing. The biggest things they had on him was that he was arrested when he was 22 for having an affair with a married woman, that he initally told the draft board that he was in perfect health and later pointed out that he had a perforated eardrum (verified as true) and a neurosis about being in crowds (unlikely, but unverified as true or false), and that he fibbed about whether Chicago organized crime figure Sam Giancanna was at a show that Sinatra was also at in Atlantic City. BIG DEAL! The lack of dirt here proves what I always suspected, that Frank Sinatra was merely a vicitm of b.s. tabloids and a paranoid Cold-War government. The &quot;Sinatra Files&quot; reveal that Frank was actually a very stand-up guy and great American citizen.	2001-08-28

As the book progresses, we can see how a combination of factors (including Nicholas' own non-confrontational personality, paranoia and over-protectiveness of the secret police, and Nicholas and Alexandra's faith in Rasputin) caused Nicholas to miss the signs that the absolutist monarchy had to come to an end. As is to be expected from a tale based on personal writings, the story is sympathetic to the family and portrays the barbarity of the execution in the most compelling manner. The focus of this book is very narrow, however. While we get a detailed description of the thoughts and feelings of the Romanovs', we see almost nothing of the larger picture of what was going on in the rest of Russia and the world. Information is notably lacking on the progress of World War I and the Bolshevik revolution, except as the Romanovs encountered them. The narrow focus is both a strength and weakness of the book. It is a weakness in that the reader would need some supplementary reading in order to understand what was going on in Russia overall at the time, but it is a strength in that the reader is seeing the world from the limited viewpoint of the Tsar and his family, and you get a feel for just how sheltered they were and how incomprehensible world events and their own fate must have seemed to them.	2001-08-27

I found the most brilliant section to be his critique of John Cage. Cage created music with the aim of \\"quieting the mind, to open it to divine influence.\\" Kahn is the first to articulate what I have felt, that Cage, the zen anarchist, is just as manipulative with this goal as any tonal symphonic architect! As Kahn puts in,<br /><br /> \\"...Cagean silence...has silenced other things, as it dwells at the problematic edge of audibility and attempts to hear the world of sound without hearing aspects of the world in a sound\\" (p. 4) Kahn turns on its head Cage's stated aim of \\"just letting sound be,\\" speaking rather of \\"Cage's dominion of all sound and always sound,\\" a project to turn all sound into music! (p. 197)<br /><br /> Much of the rest of the book, the sections on \\"Water Flows and Flux\\" and \\"Meat Voices,\\" is a wandering chronicle of various avant forms, and Kahn has fun with organic analogies.

US	50702879	R2SDEI1JS321LQ	0684870045	872816049	Quest for the Quantum Computer	Books	4	24	35	N	N	Nice job	One of the hottest topics in foundational research in quantum physics at the present time, and of overriding importance technologically, quantum computation will no doubt remain as a tour de force in years to come. The author does a fairly good job of summarizing the history and background of the theory and experimental situation in quantum computation. It is written for the layman but the author does not hestitate to interject some elementary mathematics. The author does a good job of overviewing the relevant physics, but exaggerates sometimes certain experimental results, in particular, the experimental verification of entanglement. David Deutsch, well-known in the theory of quantum computation and foundations of physics, gives a superb forward to the book. He deplores the situation of not encouraging criticism of accepted truths that he sees occuring in most universities. I think he is correct in most respcts, as such an attitude is very manifested in the current attitude on quantum entanglement: it is taken to be axiomatic that such a concept has been experimentally verified by most in the field. The first chapter gives a brief overview of what is ahead in the book, and what a quantum computer could do if constructed, and a little history behind the research on quantum computing. A discussion of Shannon information theory and Landauer's principle is given in the next chapter. The later is supposed to allow one to get away from the kT minimum energy requirement for each unit of computation, using a concept of logical irreversibility. The double-well scenario he describes though is a little suspect, since if viewed from the standpoint of quantum field theory the barrier will effectively disappear because of quantum interference. DNA computers, the Fredkin gate and the the billiard computer follow as examples of reversible computers. The billiard computer should be definitely classified as a thought experiment, for one can show that such a system is chaotic, nullifying its utility for computation (at least in the ordinary sense of computation). A more promising approach, via cellular automata, is discussed. It was refreshing to see that Paul Benioff's theories were discussed in this book, as his results were the first meaningful attempt to model classical computation by using quantum physics. I read Benioff's papers in 1990, eleven years after they were first published, my interest being somewhat different, namely that of studying the suppression of classical chaos by quantum fluctuations. Benioff was concerned with the effect of quantum fluctuations on classical computation, i.e. would the efficacy of a classical computer be reduced at the quantum level? In attempting to explain the construction of a quantum computer, the author does a good job of describing some of the important operations that act on quantum states, such as quantum rotations and Hadamard transformations. The work of Peter Shor, who received a Fields Medal for his &quot;quantum&quot; algorithm that factors numbers efficiently, is described in the book, and the author in this discussion introduces the reader to some elementary ideas in cryptography. This is followed by an excellent overview of the field quantum cryptography. Unfortunately, the discussion is limited to quantum encryption schemes that are based on quantum entanglement, the latter of which has no sound experimental foundation. The author also does a fine job of discussing the role of decoherence in &quot;messing-up&quot; the operation of a quantum computer. The time scales involved in decoherence are something that has been the subject of much interest, and will no doubt be of the deciding factor in making quantum computation a workable idea. Ion trap, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and nuclear magnetic resonance have been studied intensively as candidates for quantum computers, and the author details nicely the current experimental situation in these approaches. The role of quantum error correction is also detailed in the book, and the author introduces the reader to what can be done with to do fault-tolerant computation. The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger experiment is presented in the context of NMR, but the author remarks that the nonlocal features of the GHZ experiment cannot be tested using NMR techniques, and so other approaches must be used. The Grover algorithm, and its power in database searching, is discussed also. The author ends the book appropriately with speculations and best-guess predictions on the future of quantum computing. One can only hope that quantum computers will be normal parts of the computing scenery in this century, and this book does show effectively the intensity in the research efforts to bring it about. With some justification though one could wonder why the adjective &quot;quantum&quot; is used to describe this form of computing at all. It is one thing to describe a concept using the formalism of Hilbert spaces, it is quite another thing to justify that this concept is actually physical. The geometry of Hilbert space does result in peculiar predictions for physical phenomena, but there are many other constructions, in mathematics for example, that are based on Hilbert spaces but have no physical analog. Perhaps, we should all refer to the theory of computation expounded in this book as &quot;Hilbert space computation&quot;, rather than quantum computation. Such a description would free those interested to not think of physics as computation, but instead to construct a computer that is far better in performance than the ordinary &quot;classical&quot; one, but whose theory of computation and logic is based on Hilbert spaces, and not ordinary logic. The goal then would be to construct a real working example of such a computer....it might not be one that has anything to do with (traditional) quantum physics.ection is also detailed in the book, and the author introduces the reader to what can be done with to do fault-tolerant computation.

In fact, the book pays only a relatively superficial bit of attention to analyzing the core precepts of Falun Gong. Rather, this book is a description of the Chinese government's and media response to Falun Gong and whether that reaction is rational or justified. From that perspective, the book is quite good. Schechter is quite careful in indicating that while he presents alleged first person narratives of torture going on in China of incarcerated practitioners, those narratives are still alleged descriptions. They have not been verified. And in the appendix, he provides the reader with excerpts from publications that present both benign and critical descriptions of Falun Gong and its founder, Li Hongzhi. What the book is quite exceptional at is showing how the Western media has been lazy in its coverage of the Falun Gong issue in China, often adopting the lexicon of the Chinese government-controlled press, and hence becoming a mere mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party. And it also challenges the reader's ability to accept core constitutional precepts, such as if all humans are to enjoy the right of religious/spiritual freedom, than all forms of religious/spiritual thought must enjoy those protections. If it isn't Christian or Jewish, Westerners tend to deride other doctrines as &quot;cults,&quot; which only reveals an ethnocentric ignorance and intellectual laziness endemic in Western society. A reader of this text is not asked to decide whether Falun Gong should be considered legitimate. That is quite beside the point. Rather, the reader is asked whether Falun Gong practitioners should be allowed to practice their beliefs without mollestation. This text also reveals how China's decision to drastically cut back medical benefits to huge portions of its population sowed the seeds for Falun Gong's popularity because the doctrine does boast improved health through personal cultivation. No wonder it appeals to middle-aged and elderly people more than others, because it has been precisely this demographic that suffered the greatest loss because of the Chinese government's decision to reduce medical benefits. If we believe in religious and spiritual freedom, then the answer must be yes, Falun Gong and its practitioneers should be left alone. In the United States, the debates that form the historic Supreme Court decisions that define our freedoms were and continue to be initiated by what the rest of society deems as &quot;fringe&quot; elements. The right we have to refuse to recite the Pledge of Allegiance we owe to Jehovah's Witness.

On the other hand, if you're a historian who seeks the truth, this book is extremely misleading, the quotes are selective, and the presented facts are often contradictory. For example:<BR> 1-On page 47 Martin stated the Palestinians were close to half a million, while on page 50 he stated a different number ( close to three quarter of a million).<BR> 2- He always presented Arab-Jewish fights as being racist in nature, which can not be further from the truth. The same incidents were described by Tom Segev (One Palestine Complete) and Benny Morris (Righteous Victims) to be on personal or criminal basis. Actually, as an Arab, I like to inform you that Arabs often fight against each other with even more violence.<BR> 3- Martin often selectively quoted Ben-Gurion and Ahad Ha'Am. For example, he never mentioned that Ben-Gurion always advocated &quot;Compulsory Transfer&quot; of Palestinians or his anti-Arab speeches, or the famous speech by Ahad Ha'Am informing the Zionists congress in the early 20th century that most of the fertile land in Palestine is being planted and taken care off by the indigenous population.<BR> Finally, as a historian I find this book useless from historical research stand point since Martin did not provide a numbered notes for the quoted source where his findings could be verified, which often lead him to contradict himself.

This book is touted as showing how to prevent disease through changing your lifestyle, right? Well, keep in mind that the authors never tried changing their subjects' lifestyles!  So we really have no way of knowing whether if the nurses they studied had changed their diets, they would have been healthier or not. In medical science, the only way to really find these things out is to actually do a clinical trial...randomly assign people to different groups to follow a certain program and then see what program is best.  These authors didn't do that so their results are just observational. You might see in your neighborhood that three women who like to wear lavender clothes all came down with cancer...does that prove that if you stop wearing lavender clothes you won't get cancer?  These authors have never shown that they can prevent disease through their recommendations. The authors never treated these women as patients, in fact they never even saw them!  Also keep in mind that all these results are just based on the subject's reports of what they ate, how much they weighed etc.  The authors never verified that the answers were truthful.  And they never measured the women's blood pressure or cholesterol levels or any other ordinary lab tests that your doctor does on a routine visit.  So this book  is really just a bunch of advice that sounds plausible but might or might not have any effect on preventing disease.  Don't believe the hype!	2001-08-14

It is the best example I've ever experienced of the scientific method put into action. <br />The author is absolutely committed, throughout his research, to the use of logic and evidence to reach conclusions. If an observed result is not logical, he tries to find the hole in it, and devises another test. If his theories are not verified by observation, he finds the hole in his thinking. He is never bound by either conventional thinking or even by his own theories.

The chapter on the Black Dahlia strongly supports John Gilmore's work, and SEVERED.  What better recommendation can be had?  <br />SEVERED is violent crime and sexual homicide, and loaded with frightening photographs.  Elizabeth Short, the notorious Black Dahlia is a haunting persona as portrayed by Gilmore, and his masterful stroke of never letting one get too close to her hangs her in suspension, remaining an enigma.  She is a shadowy figure drifitng in a haze.  Other times she is as real as one's self, laughing or fearful, yet even then she manages to escape from the reader, the same as she escapes from real life in her strange, whirlpool travels that rush her to violent death.  John Gilmore takes us back into a 1940's Los Angeles world of cops, grifters, movie extras, B-girls, the whole nine yards.  He creates a landscape barren of emotion and riddled with danger.  This is as bleak as a foggy bog where the unwary get trapped.  That's how you feel reading his book.  Trapped!  This work has to be destined an icon of American pop culture.	2001-08-13

Why is it featured here?<br /><br />After a two-year study of the key strategic decisions that most often determine growth or stagnation in business, Zook (with Allen) realized that clients of Bain & Company were eager to share the results of that study. Only later did he decide to write this book, one in which he presents and then develops \\"a useful framework for understanding and addressing the key decision points encountered in growing a business.\\" He concluded that this framework is practical and could be applied (with appropriate modification) within almost any organization. In the Preface, Zook acknowledges that he was surprised by some of the findings which he briefly identifies. He then observes: \\"Central to our findings are three ideas: the concept of the core  business and its boundaries; the idea that every business has a level of full-potential performance that usually exceeds what the company imagines; and the idea that performance-yield loss occurs at many levels, from strategy to leadership to organizational capabilities to execution.\\" In the five chapters which follow, Zook (with Allen) examines \\"the types of strategic business decisions that most often seem to tilt the odds of future success or failure.\\" Zook correctly suggests in this book that many organizations cannot resist the appeal (\\"the siren's song\\") of \\"miracle cures\\" of their problems. Zook focuses entirely on what has been verified in real-world experience, on what is practical, and on what will reliably achieve the desired results of sound strategic decisions.<br /><br />He and his associates learned a great deal from the study, confiding that \\"some of the results were quite counterintuitive to us.\\" Several of the findings caught my eye and caused me to challenge a few of my own cherished assumptions. For example,  that \\"the choice of the next hot industry was much less important in driving growth and profitability over the long term than were strategy, competitive position, reinvesting rates, and execution.\\" They also learned that many of the most successful sustained growth companies are actually in lower growth businesses (e.g. Enron in energy, ServiceMaster in basic services, and Bechtel in engineering). Why? Zook suggests that \\"it might be precisely the difficulty of of these market environments that elicits superior business creativity in the search for new growth out of their core businesses.\\" In other words, these companies ignored \\"the siren's song\\" and stuck to the aforementioned \\"basics\\": strategy, competitive position, reinvesting rates, and execution. In the last chapter, Zook quotes Sun Tzu: \\"The more opportunities that I seize, the more opportunities that multiply before me.\\" He then asserts that this phenomenon \\"is at the heart of growth strategy and embodies the fundamental tension between protecting the core [i.e. `the basics'] and driving into more and better adjacencies, propelled by greater and greater success.\\"<br /><br />The various mini-case studies provided are very informative. I also appreciative the dozens of check lists (e.g. \\"Ten Key Questions for Management\\"), charts (e.g. 3-1 \\"Adjacencies Radiate from the Core\\"), and chapter \\"Conclusion\\" sections, all of which serve two important functions: they distill key ideas, and, they can serve as helpful reminders when reviewed later. Obviously, the \\"goal posts\\" in today's business world approach and then withdraw, widen and then narrow, with sometimes maddening unpredictability. Wait until they are closer for an easier kick or kick now (\\"carpe diem\\") before they begin to back up? Wait until they are wider? What if they become narrower? This metaphorical situation is complicated by the fact that opponents are trying to block the kick in what may well be inclement weather or at least against the wind. Kick now or wait?<br /><br />One of the most interesting concepts shared in this book is what Zookrefers to as \\"The Alexander Problem.\\" Briefly, Alexander the Great and his armies eventually conquered an area stretching from Mount Olympus to Mount Everest. That was accomplished in less than four years. His resources became overextended. \\"His sticking point -- the failure to anchor in the core business (in his case, governance) and consolidate a rapid expansion --exemplifies the most common problem across all growth strategy\\": pursuing the wrong adjacency opportunities. With Alexander's premature death, his empire died with him. He was its core. The same is true of countless companies which expand into related segments which do not utilize, much less reinforce, the strength of their profitable core. \\"Business adjacencies are growth opportunities that follow a company to extend the boundaries of its core business. What distinguishes an adjacency from another growth opportunity is the extent to which it draws on the customer relationships, technologies, or skills in the core business to build competitive advantage in a new, adjacent, competitive area.\\" Have you ever wondered why at least 70% of all mergers and acquisitions either fail or perform well below expectations? The board members and senior-level executives of those organizations obviously had not read Zook's analysis of \\"The Alexander Problem\\" in Chapter 3.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Crawford and Matthews'  The Myth of Excellence, Fitz-enz's The E-Aligned Enterprise as well as The ROI of Human Capital, and Collins & Porras' Built to Last.Problem.\\" Briefly, Alexander the Great and his armies eventually conquered an area stretching from Mount Olympus to Mount Everest.

The book was reissued in July 1991 by a different publisher: Pelican Publishing Co., a small Louisiana publisher. This new edition features cover blurbs from such people as Hal Lindsey and Johanna Michaelson (who helped get the book published in the first place, but who I thought accepted the Cornerstone criticisms) and Mike Warnke (whose claims of being a &quot;former Satanist High Priest&quot; have also been shown to be false by Cornerstone).<br />What is most galling about the new edition of the book, however, is its afterword, by three Los Angeles clinical psychologists, all women sporting either an M.D. or Ph.D. after their names. The two-page afterword does not address *any* of the Cornerstone criticisms, but alludes to them by saying that (paraphrase) &quot;some critics state that this book should not have been published unless every single fact within it could be verified and documented.&quot; It goes on to say how unreasonable these critics are, and that numerous other people have reported stories &quot;like&quot; Lauren Stratford's. I suspect that the &quot;some critics&quot; referred to do not exist; that no one has made any such claim about Stratford's book. The Cornerstone criticism thoroughly documented the fact that the book is almost entirely a fabrication by Laurel Wilson (the real name of &quot;Lauren Stratford&quot;), a very disturbed young woman whose story has changed radically over time.<br />Surely both the publisher and these clinical psychologists must be aware of the details of these criticisms. To go ahead and republish the book is the height of irresponsibility.	2001-07-29
US	52386663	R352ASHX1RPNTH	0198742371	587291072	A Philosophy of Mass Art	Books	4	30	32	N	N	Logical, stimulating brief for mass art (ie popular culture)	Carroll is worth reading just for the refreshing contrast he provides to the postmodernism that is endemic in cultural studies.  Carroll applies analytic philosophy (ie, basically logic) to what he calls \\"mass art,\\" and mainly has the same goal as the majority of cultural studies scholars -- he defends \\"mass art\\" as being potentially just as worthy as \\"elite art,\\" both aesthetically and as the topic of analytical inquiry. However, Carroll is emphatically not part of the cultural studies scene -- his arguments have to do with the way \\"mass art\\" is, by design, accessible to ALL people, not just certain favored, oppressed groups.  Carroll's political agenda then, if you take the position that we all have one, would seem to be a liberal humanism of the Enlightenment, which is not a category I consign to the Evil Other of a binary category!<br /><br /> I appreciate Carroll's independence, but his definition of \\"mass art\\" is idiosyncratic and not likely to take the field by storm.  The definition has 3 parts:  1) the art is a multiple instance, 2) produced and distributed by a mass technology, and 3) is designed (with narrative form, symbolism, intended affect and content) to be accessible with minimum effort by the largest number of people.  So Carroll wants to define his \\"mass\\" category both in contrast to pre-industrial popular art that was not mass produced, and to avant-garde art that is not designed to appeal to the \\"mass\\" of people.<br /><br /> This is problematic.  While Carroll argues persuasively against MacDonald, Greenberg, Collingwood, Adorno and Horkheimer in his first chapter defending the potential of mass/popular art, he maintains the distinction between high and low art, which he calls instead \\"avant-garde\\" and \\"mass.\\"  He attacks what he calls the \\"Eliminativist\\" position, which the rest of us know as social constructionism -- boundaries around different cultural fields are socially constructed, and the aesthetic criteria for these boundaries are basically arbitrary other than what has been established by convention.  But  Carroll's binary distinction here simply will not work in terms of empirical application.  The reality of what I think is better considered as a plural, shifting field of \\"popular culture\\" (with \\"popular art\\" as a subset) is that very few artists/works of art are truly \\"massively popular.\\"  In the mass market, most everything is a niche, from the ska-punk Warped Tour to devotees of Beethoven's string quartets.  Robert Christgau, pop music critic for the Village Voice, coined the term \\"semi-pop\\" in 1980 to recognize the splintering of the 60s mass market across the 1970s.  Perhaps Carroll's thinking is skewed by his expertise in popular films, as mine may be by my greater knowledge of popular music -- there is arguably still a larger, more common audience for Hollywood movies than there is for pop music.  But considering popular culture as a whole, I don't find Carroll persuasive.<br /><br /> Carroll calls his definition a \\"theory.\\"  Perhaps, although as a sociologist I define theory as an explanation.  Carroll's definition simply creates a classificatory scheme.  There is an aspect of his definition of \\"mass art\\" that could be developed into a theory, and that is his implication that there is a biological/psychological basis for what art appeals to the broad masses of people.  At the same time, he emphasizes people's use of reason in analyzing mass art, so his doesn't follow through on this idea.  I doubt that it would work.  Here are three examples of why not:<br /><br /> 1) Bruce Springsteen's song \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", which is clearly not a patriotic anthem, based on the lyrics, was treated as one by many male fans holding up jabbing \\"#1\\" fingers and singing along with the chorus during his 1985 tour.<br /><br /> 2) When John Lennon said the Beatles were \\"more popular than Jesus,\\" Beatles albums were burned in communal bonfires across the U.S. Bible Belt.<br /><br /> 3) Techno music substantially replaced rock music as the dominant pop music form in Europe in the 1990s, while in the U.S. techno remains a subculture and rap music has been the form to substantially replace rock.<br /><br /> How can these examples be squared with the idea that \\"mass art\\" taps into universal biological responses in people?  A second point to draw is that there is diversity within a \\"mass\\" audience.  By definition, I would be bold enough to say, the bigger the audience for an artist/work of art, the greater the diversity of views of that art among its audience.  Back to Christgau's \\"semi-pop\\"...<br /><br /> Carroll's book is six chapters long.  The first two chapters are excellent, arguing against the \\"majority tradition\\" that has condemned mass/popular/low art, and against the \\"minority tradition\\" (Benjamin and McLuhan) who have celebrated \\"mass art.\\"  The final three chapters are also excellent, analyzing emotion, morality and ideology in \\"mass art.\\"  The problem lies in Chapter 3, \\"The Nature of Mass Art\\" where Carroll presents his definition.  Despite the problems with the core of Carroll's presentation, the book is well worth reading.  The clarity of Caroll's thinking forces the reader to clarify her own thinking, which is the goal of any good, clear analytic philosophy.<br /><br /> For what I consider to be a more compelling theoretical account, I recommend Peter J. Martin's SOUNDS AND SOCIETY (see my review), which presents a social constructionist theory of music (and art more broadly, by extension) which Carroll would appreciate for its clarity of exposition.  This is not just a case of sociological loyalty, given that Martin critiques the social-structural theory that the meaning of music/art is the simple product of its social context.<br /><br />(verified purchase from a large brick-and-mortar bookstore)ially replaced rock music as the dominant pop music form in Europe in the 1990s, while in the U.S. techno remains a subculture and rap music has been the form to substantially replace rock.<br /><br /> How can these examples be squared with the idea that \\"mass art\\" taps into universal biological responses in people?

If this info is wrong - and it wasn't even dependent upon anyone's personal recollections, but rather could have been verified in numerious reference materials readily available to any layman - then I wonder how many other &quot;facts&quot; in this book are also incorrect.

Par for the course for this book which repeats itself over and over (count how many times George mentions that &quot;now that Bette had a good marriage and a daughter...&quot; in various forms). <br />Inevitably, bios that depend so much upon quotes from people whose 15 minutes of fame was during the time the author spent interviewing them, are bound to be caught up in their own sudden value.

Evans is a powerful, meticulous, and deeply troubling summation of his preparation for, and testimony at the David Irving Trial. The idea that a trial was needed to prove that the Holocaust did take place despite the writings of the rabid anti-Semite David Irving is almost beyond belief. The fact that the trial was brought by a suit initiated by David Irving is astounding. For while his life has been consumed by creating History as he wanted it to be, reading his words as he impales his ideas and himself would have been pathetic were his victims History at all questionable. However here his public and professional suicide was appropriate.<br />What is very disturbing is that even after he was exposed for nothing more than an ideologue that twisted facts when he needed to, and created them from thin air when there was nothing to twist, is that his peers did not ostracize him completely and without exception. By peers I refer to legitimate Historians whose work is accurate and can be verified. History can certainly be revised when new facts are learned, but never when they are the creation of a fertile yet fetid mind. This was not a blow to free speech as some have suggested. Free speech does not grant the right to create and represent as true, that, which the writer knows to be false, or worse, information that the writer has conjured. The only Historians that should feel threatened by this trials' outcome should logically be those who are concerned as to how well their work is documented, and free of ludicrous speculation.<br />Professional Historians must be held to a much higher standard than other writers. Through their work they document our History and serve as custodians of the past. We must be able to rely upon them, and also on their peers to see that writers of hate-based novels like those of David Irving never reach a courtroom. His fictions must be marginalized to those of his kind who have made the decision to retreat from what is true and create their own hate-filled version of the world.<br />Professor Evans is also to be commended for discussing the fact that while the Jews were unquestionably the primary target of Hitler and his sociopaths, there were also hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who were slaughtered together alongside the Jews in the camps. The survivors of the crimes of World War II are becoming fewer in number every day. As they pass and their numbers decline so will the power of the advocacy they can summon. This is the challenge moving forward, to ensure the record remains accurate and free from the diseases that are David Irving and his ilk.<br />This is a wonderfully readable book that sets out what History is, and what it is not. As long as there are men and woman who are willing to dedicate their time and skills to the destruction of these falsifiers, these deniers, both our History and our Future are safe.o retreat from what is true and create their own hate-filled version of the world.<br />Professor Evans is also to be commended for discussing the fact that while the Jews were unquestionably the primary target of Hitler and his sociopaths, there were also hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who were slaughtered together alongside the Jews in the camps.

Bugliosi builds his case thoroughly and in a lively manner, amply footnoted and verified.  He has employed simple logic and common sense throughout and come to the unavoidable conclusion that the Supreme Court decisions of December 9th and 12th 2000 were not only without legal merit but, by virtue of the direct usurpation and perversion of clearly stated processes in the constitution, should by rights leave the perpetrators open to criminal prosecution.  Though, as Bugliosi points out, this is nearly a political impossibility, the moral reality of the crime committed is irrefutable and ably outlined and spotlighted by this impassioned display of reason, facts and justice.

That sort of thing doesn't seem to be done anymore.  Our culture today prefers to tear people down, as in the book series \\"Kill Your Idols.\\"<br /><br /> My life was changed by Dylan's music of the '60s, though, and I couldn't resist reading the new books during the year of his 60th birthday.  \\"Down the Highway\\" is a bland, by-the-numbers bio.  It manages to take someone as fascinating as Dylan and make him boring.  I don't read biographies, as a rule, and Sounes' book reminds me why.  It may have some revealing detail not available elsewhere about Dylan's second marriage and financial dealings, but that's not what I'm interested in.<br /><br /> If you want to read a really interesting book with much more detail (it's nearly 300 pages longer), check out Heylin's [[ASIN:006052569X Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited]].  It's not a conventional bio -- he leaves long direct quotes intact throughout the entire text instead of reducing them to the mush of the omniscient narrator.<br /><br />AND, Heylin has been inspired by the IDEAS in Dylan's music, as have I, and pursues the meaning at the intersection of the man's life and his art.  That is still a worthwhile quest, even though it is not possible to read either of these books and maintain an idealistic view of the Hero...<br /><br />(verified library loan)	2001-07-18

Sounes' DOWN THE HIGHWAY is dull, boring and uninformative by comparison.  The copy of BEHIND THE SHADES REVISITED sitting in front of me is 720 pages long, without the long list of interviewees, discography, bibliography and so forth at the back, so I don't know why the site description lists it as five hundred and some.  Where Sounes' book is a by-the-numbers bio, Heylin leaves long quotes intact throughout the book, giving it a rich texture, rather than reducing it to the mush of the omniscient narrator.<br /><br /> The last book I read about Dylan was Scaduto's in 1972.  These books of 2001 no longer make possible the naive hero worship I was so thrillingly involved in back then while in high school.  It's the art that is Great, not the man, an imperfect vessel.  I have come, over time, to find a tragic view of life much more accurate than a heroic one, and that seems to be something that Dylan and I have both learned.  Young idealists beware -- you can safely listen to Dylan's '60s music and read Scaduto if you want to avoid these things -- I wouldn't want to have been old before MY time!<br /><br /> Beyond technique, what really sets Heylin's book apart and makes it compelling (I personally have no interest in a National Enquirer-style expose) is that his life has been changed by Dylan's music, just as mine has.  He therefore seeks the meaning at the intersection of the man and the art.  This is still a worthwhile quest.

Amelia verified everything I have believed from the time I was a little girl, I just couldn't prove it.  When the author ran thru the names of books she had read, (Women Who Run w/Wolves, Henry Blake, Monty Roberts, Stephen Covey, Allen M Schoen,  Betty Edwards)it sounded like the same list I've been reading for years.  <br />My first real &quot;animal book&quot; was in high school, &quot;Kinship  With All Life&quot;...and I never stopped believing.  I talked to ants and animals.  I rescued spides, scorpions, and tarantullas.  I have found rattlesnakes in my barn and out by my shed and have  simply told them (verbally) that they were welcome as long as they left my horses and other companions alone.  I've never had a problem. <br />I also liked Amelia's suggestion to ask God, &quot;What can I do today to glorify God and love man.&quot;   YES YES YES!!!  When she said that man was the image and likeness of God I almost fell out of my chair (I was raised with that statement in church).  Amelia's statement, that she never believed that God and man are separate is so true.  I always figured if God loved man and the rest of the animals, of course we can all communicate together as we all have the same Father/Mother. <br />I read this book on the plane home and finished it the next day.  I cried often with Joy reading it.  The day I finished the book I immediately told my indoor companions how much I love them (two dogs and a cat). <br />That night in bed I told my female cat (Kiki) how much she was loved and how special she is.  All this was done mentally  (I might as well start practicing).   <br />Kiki rarely sleeps on the bed in the summer, it's too hot.  But that night I told her how I felt and that I really loved it when she reached out her paw and touched me before I fell asleep.  She's only done it about twice in her life (she was a rescued stray and often goes days without wanting attention).  Then I told her &quot;Good Night, Kiki, I love you&quot;, (which is part  of my nightly ritual).  I closed my eyes and immediately I felt her little paw against my arm.  With tears in my eyes I told her thank you and that I loved her too.  I petted her and closed my eyes again, and again that little paw slid up against my arm.  I just opened my eyes and mentally told her how much she was loved.   They're ALL so special. <br />Thank you Amelia.	2001-07-18

Information includes dates and locations of birth and death, grave location (cemetery, section and plot numbers), cause of death, and identifiable screen role(s). The only possible shortcomings are lack of cemetery maps and pictures of the deceased, and these are probably due to the high publishing costs associated with these features.

I feel sorry for the heavy women out there that will read this and have their fantasies verified that they will ONLY find happiness once they are thin! I was really disappointed because from the cover I thought Jemima actually found love the way she was, now that would have been a good book. And by the way, the sterotypes, which the book is full of, are aggravating, but the one that really got me was how in the major bookstores in L.A. they don't have any 'real' books, only books on film!

This book appears to be a systematic compilation of research.<br />However, if we examine more closely the source of the information, we find that it is derived from sessions with a psychic trance medium who is channeling the words of discarnate entities.

So, let's give the author credit for the ability to collect and organize information from many sources in this world and the next.<br />But is this true research? Where are the case studies, the clinical trials and practitioner reports which could corroborate this information? Where is the field work with the plants to confirm the qualities and healing powers that are attributed to them?<br />With its charts and systematic organization the book seems to be the result of meticulous research. In fact, it is a collection of highly speculative, unverified claims, and thus it is dangerously irresponsible.<br />This reviewer does not discount the possibility that talented individuals can access information from other dimensions of reality. But such activity is not passive. It is our responsibility to substantiate the accuracy and truth of information we gather from other sources, be they discarnate or of this world. <br />Gurudas has not done this, .. however attractive it appears. <br />It is unfortunate that this book has become a model for countless others to wander off into delusional flights of unexamined psychic fancy in the creation of vibrational essences of all kinds. <br />Gurudas cites the spiritual philospher and initiate Rudolf Steiner in many references, footnotes throughout the book.

The author argues that life first orginated on another planet and the genetic \\"seeds of life swarm throughout the cosmos\\" and later seeded the Earth.  As the author points out, this idea first originated over 2000 years ago and maybe even 6000 years ago, and was the basis of the original Sumerian/Babylonian creationist theory which became: The spirit of God hovered over the waters.   Many of the author's arguments about the speed of light and the age of the universe have been verified since the publication of the 1st edition of this book.  He points out that because the age of the universe is unknown, and since DNA could not have been manufactured on Earth,  the antiquity of life is also unknown. He states that has creatures have hitchhiked from planet to planet following cosmic collisions, they have swapped genes and increased their storehouse of genetic information.  Some of these arguments regarding gene swapping have been confirmed in the last few months in articles in Science and Nature.  I find it interesting that many of his seemingly most outlandish arguments are subsequently confirmed.   The author has published a number of scientific studies in scientific journals on the evolution of the brain and human behavior, but, as demonstrated in this book, he is not a Darwinian. Rather, he indicates that since bacteria contain human genes which have give rise to the human genome, that the first creatures to appear on Earth may have also had human genes, and thus the genetic instructions for the \\"metamorphosis\\" of all living creatures.  This is a unique idea and this is a unique and interesting book that repeatedly dares to challenge current scientific theory.  What is equally interesting, is the extreme reactions to this book.  People either love it and offer nothing but praise for the author, or they  hate it to such a degree that one gets the feeling they would lynch the author if they could get their hands on him. Hate is irrational, and so are many of the negative comments made about this book, which is why the haters mischaracterized the content and demand that you not read the book or that it should be burned.... On the other hand, I think it is just as irrational to characterize the author as \\"the greatest thinker of all time.\\" He's not.  However, it may be true that he is years ahead of his time, and for that only the future will tell.	2001-07-11
US	52979108	R18LXCH7OKR644	0814470882	323930217	Preparing for the Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification Exam	Books	1	33	35	N	N	Full of wrong information, and no credit to source materials	I bought this book specifically as a tertiary resource of practice questions for my PMP exam preparation. What a waste. First of all, the questions are taken, in some cases verbatim, in other cases rewritten inaccurately, from another source: &quot;PMBOK Q&amp;A. A Pocket Guide of Questions and Answers to Learn More About the Project Management Body of Knowledge&quot; published by PMI. Nowhere in this book does it credit the PMI source material. Secondly, in at least 7 questions(pg 215 - #7, pg 217 - #19, pg 219 - #2, pg 233 - #12, pg 233 - #13, pg 235 - #20, pg 300 - #13) that I was able to document, the answers given are just plain wrong as verified by cross-checking both the PMBOK itself, and the &quot;Pocket Guide&quot; listed above. Thirdly, unlike the &quot;Pocket Guide&quot;, this book doesn't give references to the sources of correct answers (which prabably explains why the answers are wrong) so that you can look up and study missed questions.  Although I didn't read any of the preparatory materials in the front of this book, I would be very leery of them, based on the inaccuracies I found in the test questions. I would suggest to anyone who wants accurate and useful preparation materials, to use PMI published sources, take practice tests with the ESI materials, and take a good review course from your local PMI chapter.	2001-07-11
US	53036003	R1BT1PTYIK7LF2	0198207441	279569564	The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft	Books	5	60	66	N	N	The first *real* history of Wicca	I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It will give you all the details on how Wicca came to be created in the mid-twentieth century, based on literary, artistic, and academic fashions, the practices of fraternal orders and occult societies, old and new folk customs, and other cultural roots (real and imagined) going back to the 1700s. Hutton leaves no hope for those who wish to believe in a constantly existing Pagan religion in Britain or in a connection between the early modern witch trials and Paganism. No one can claim to be knowledgeable about the true history of modern Witchcraft who has not read and carefully studied this text.    This meticulously documented book pounds the final nails into the coffin of the claims Gardner made (and others inflated) that Wicca was an ancient surviving British Pagan religion of Witchcraft. None but the most stubbornly fundamentalist of Orthodox Wiccans can deny it any longer, though they have  continued to try.    Hutton's work supports and amplifies the research into Wiccan history that I and other modern writers have done over the last thirty years. Indeed, the chapters in my book Bonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca on Gerald Gardner and the birth of Wicca owe a great deal to his clear exposition of complex details.    Every Wiccan should have this book on their shelves.    A PS for 2006: Many of the complaints by other reviewers here seem to me to be attempts to substitute unverified (and deliberately unverifiable) claims by modern Pagan authors to \\"secret evidence\\" they supposedly have access to that Hutton did not. Others are attempts to use misdirection by saying that Classical religions had (and Classical writers mentioned) goddesses similar to what modern Wicca has and \\"therefore\\" Wicca is ancient. No, because Gerald Gardner studied those ancient religions and read many of those Classical authors. Just using bits and pieces of something old in your invention doesn't constitute \\"proof\\" that your invention is itself old. Gardner was a brilliant creative artist who started something wonderful. Let's give him the credit he deserves and stop trying to shoot the messengers who have revealed his creative efforts. As for Hutton, I know him personally, and I know that he is far from being a \\"hostile enemy\\" to Wicca, being instead a sympathetic yet honest scholar. The Neopagan movement needs more authors like Hutton, not fewer.	2001-07-10
US	44842080	RLO4PKHVNTPTK	0312145314	413136101	Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac	Books	5	13	23	N	N	The Dark Side  of The Beat Generation	For the first time a realistic biography has finally been written concentrating on and revealing in part THE DARK TRUTH ABOUT THE BEAT GENERATION. Ellis Amburn's biography is one of the first to ADMIT in any \\"official\\" capacity, and show through the biographical medium of Jack Kerouac, the simple undeniable fact that the Beat Generation is, like most rebellious movements comprised of the young, the unaccepted, the lost, misplaced, unacknowledged, leaderless, angry, artistic, philosophical, experimental, et.al---largely consumed by dark, forbidden ( by society) impulses and passions too powerful to deny and are often obsessed and fascinated by them too much NOT to explore....      It is Kerouac's dream that people want, not the truth of his life; even the numerous biographies have but scratched \\"the beat surface\\", somehow writing their way around the truth as if it were a reality whose skirts they were too terrified to lift, as a veil guarding from sore eyes what is not a handsome leg! Not so with Ellis Amburn's subterranean Kerouac!      Amburn was Kerouac's editor the last decade of Kerouac's life.... He came into Kerouac's career, fittingly, about the time of \\"Big Sur\\", in which K, admits for the first time on record to his Angel that he is  going absolutely crazy in the horrific manner of narcotica... K.'s literary skills of graphic description here do not tantalize, but horrify! This is the book that alienated Kerouac's own audience, and Amburn coming on the scene from here onwards is qualified to paint the portrait of Kerouac in a realistic manner worthy of Soviet Realist Literature, who is writing from personal memoir as well as from biographical investigation. Of course all Amburn writes is verified, one can investigate matters thoroughly for oneself thanks to concise bibliographical notated sources, including Kerouac's own \\"sex-lists\\", and the information it contains is valid only because, unlike the multitude of biographies out there, it's sources ARE cited....  Kerouac struggled all his life, and the fact that he eulogizes his youth in way that produced the most Romantic literature of his generation cannot ever completely exorcise his roots in the black soil of a poor French-Canadian family of working class origins, replete with all the stigmata of the hell it is to be poor, with an alcoholic, unemployed gambler for a father and repressed, clinging, religious old-world peasant for a mother, and a dutiful son of deep inborn sorrows, \\"Ti Jean\\", who loves them at the same time they all lovingly murder one another with smiles on their faces...you know the story, writ in high Romanticism, if you've read his works, which of no writer can I recommend more than Kerouac that you read his own works first before consulting ANY biograpical tomes as Kerouac wrote his own autobiography the way Twain said \\"noone is more prepared to write about your life than you are\\" and if you want to learn about Kerouac's spirit written straight from the heart consult his works! If you want the gut-level truth about his exterior life I recommend this one. Out of them all, however, if you don't want to be enlightened as to the truth of Kerouac's life,and believe me many do NOT, then do NOT read Amburn's biography. Even though much of what Amburn writes is mentioned in the previous what?-20?-biographies,it is yet glossed over in a deceptive manner allowing the delusion and the propoganda to continue flourishing and sellsellselling everything from romantic pants to cigarettes. On a deeper level, Amburn is championing Kerouac by writing the TRUTH of his exterior life as it can only raise Kerouac's spirit that much higher exposing as it does the true grit and stamina NOT to suicide himself the easy way, but to create immortal literature in which people will find the Solace and COMPANIONSHIP Kerouac wrote for! Amburn's Subterranean Kerouac is beyond the petty bickerings of what exactly went on at some party in the village 50 years ago, who ahhumped whoso immensely they had to be resuscitated...that stuff is all fine-n-dandy but it does NOT get to the heart of the matter that is Kerouacs'!      I suspected such a biography as this would upset the lies people want so much to believe, myself included, and they are anybody but Kerouac's lies; but true romanticism is not a flight from reason but a journey towards the ultimate self, and if such a book can upset so many innumerable critics, it's a sign beckoning: \\"There is something this book did to me that is really troubling to me!\\" and people rarely get upset by lies if they truly have no significant connotation, let those who admonish and want to kill the messenger bearing bad news go back to their idle worshipping of a false idol, and believe me, it is NOT Kerouac that is false in any way, it is largely the media who has so warped the true vision these writers had, but also those who would not find out the truth for themselves, even when they drink from the very source, that metaphysical horror of existence that Kerouac with sheer courage stands under the gaze of and stares back, constantly driving himself onwards \\"on the road\\" to get to the very heart of the matter, as if it were a very definitely real place somewhere within the confines of an \\"America!\\".     Like any good biography, and there are thruths in each one not to be gleaned from any other, there is rarely any who don't break-down and cry their hearts out at the end of the life of Jack Kerouac. Many, rightly-so have said that to American Artists as well as the average reader, it is akin to the death of JFK for those who hold him close to their heart, a national tragedy. Disarming however is the real tragedy concerning Kerouac was the wretched manner in which he was treated while alive. The brutality of the establishment and the cruelty of mean spirited closed-minded people Kerouac fought against by using beautiful words, in the business of healing words...in the way he is used and marketed today still makes him very much so a 20th century American martyr. Amburn's biography is a portrait of Kerouac's inner-life in the tortured yet beautiful stylizations of German Expressionism. Kerouac fans are lucky, and some doomed, to have it. Regardless, the truth is now definately out there.	2001-07-09
US	50352096	RU71R0MZYYUGP	0812694147	928892989	The Philosophy of Seyyed Hossein Nasr (Library of Living Philosophers (Paperback))	Books	5	27	28	N	Y	Well-edited anthology of a unique contemporary philosopher	I've noticed the writings of S.H. Nasr since 1995.  While being a leading scholar on Islamic philosophy and intellectual tradition (that was how I first noticed his writings), he also holds an interesting 'traditional' views which he called (along with other Western Orientalists) 'perennial philosophy'.<br />From an editing point of view, I think this is a very solid selection of different views towards Nasr.  The first part includes an intellectual autobiography written by Nasr, which does NOT give a full restatement of his philosophy (as it was for the other non-western philosopher in this series for S. Radhakrishnan), but it gives interesting personal background of Nasr's career under the context of a wide network of philosophers in both Iran and other countries.  At the end of the book, there is a detailed bibliography of the works of Nasr in different languages.  For someone who wants to study Nasr as a philosopher, this book is simply a must, as it makes clear with Nasr's own words on what he considers to be his more important works (e.g. I'd otherwise never have suspected that his editing of Islamic Spirtuality is considered by him to be one of the more important project in his career)<br />There are also many well-written articles by critics that makes the book interesting.  The attacks by the Buddhist, Neo-Confucian standpoints, together with the critique by his collaborator M. Aminrazavi are very to-the-point which I don't think Nasr (nor any dogmatic traditionalist) can answer convincingly.  But these exchanges do help clarify some reasons why Nasr's model for the transcendent unity of world religions (which is used as the basis for inter-religious dialogues) would need modifications.  It is also interesting for me to also get to know more about Nasr's antagonistic attitudes (which I have suspected but never verified before this volume comes out) towards the other type of 'unity of religons' model propelled by Neo-Vedantist such as S. Radhakrishnan.<br />All in all, even though an expensive volume, it is a good buy if you are either interested in the thoughts of Nasr or in examining the potential basis for inter-religious dialogues.	2001-07-05

He has an engaging writing style and automated tools to assure that code compiles, and JUnit tested. There are other gripes like missing files on the CD, etc.<br />The author did have a good section about good design patterns to use when working with SAX, and common pitfalls.<br />Since the author doesn't credit anyone in the introduction I assume that it had very little technical review, and it shows. I will continue using this book as a occasional reference. Also note that the webb site listed for errants has been deactivated.<br />70% of the work is completed in 30% of the time. Because of the may mistakes in the examples, I wouldn't recommend this book for beginners, look else where.

My life a fragment is an autobiographical sketch of Maulana Muhammad Ali and fully reveals the religious aspect of his personality. It is mainly a detailed explanation of the author's religious background and his attitude towards Islamic theology.  <br />Author<br />2. Maulana Muhammad Ali was a renowned Indian Muslim leader and prince among the patriots. He was born in 1878 and after playing a glorious role in the Indian politics died in 1931. He was an impressive writer but never wrote a book due to his busy life. During a trial at Karachi in 1920, he was convicted and during his prison life he decided to compile a book on the life of the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) but was unable to do that due to the non-availability of research material in jail. Later he wanted to write another book on, \\"Islam: Kingdom of God\\". It was to be an explanation of Islam in four volumes and was to be meant for, \\"every man in the street\\". He hardly began to write the book when he was released. He lived nearly seven years after that but never had time to complete his book. The initial editor of this book Zafar Iqbal visited Jamia Millia Delhi in 1939 to collect some of the Muhammad Ali's writings and speeches. He found the manuscript of, \\"Islam: The Kingdom of God\\". Since only a quarter of the whole book was complete and its present contents presented autobiographical nature of work and did not justify the name which author once intended to give it , therefore the editor changed the name to,\\" My life: A fragment\\". This was initially published in 1942, reprinted in 1944 and 1946. Recently, this book was re-edited by Mashirul Hassan and published in 1999.  It is Maulana Muhammad Ali's first and the last book unfortunately incomplete - published.       <br />Contents<br />3. The book has 261 pages and primarily divided in to seven sections: Studies at home and at school, the awakening, my troubles and the remedy, the discovery, the secular outlook in Europe, the new zeal and Islam: Whence and Whither?         (a) In chapter one, the writer explains about his early education with special emphasis to the Islamic education. He was born in an aristocratic family of Rampur State India in 1878. His father Abdul Ali Khan died when he was two years old. His mother being an enlighten lady sent his sons to braielly India and afterwards to Aligarh university to receive best education available. According to writer, the Muslims of India were not taught Quran in Urdu because of which they are unable to understand it. According to the writer, his mother tried to give him high practical education and left him very ignorant about the details of Islamic faith and its history. (b) Chapter two and three deals with the start of his practical life. He has discussed the behavior of Westerly educated Muslims of Subcontinent with the Islamic values. He discussed in detail about the problem he faced during his profession of journalism especially once he wrote in favour of Turks and against the British Government during 1st World War. His memorable editorial,\\" the choice of the Turks\\" in a befitting reply to the insulting article of the London Times became very popular. The British Government could not tolerate his bold and inspiring criticism of the imperial powers during the war and he was confined for a period of four and a half years.    (c) Chapter four deals with his study of Quran in detail during his confinement period. He discovered many facts of life from the Quran. In chapter five, the writer has made large extracts from the views of two historian writers, \\"Well and Renan\\" about Christianity.  (d) Chapter six deals with the new political life of the writer. He was greatly impressed by the Allama Iqbal. He transformed the Indian National congress from a constitutional body in to a revolutionary mass organization. A resolution was passed in Khilafat conference held in Karachi in 1921, according to which it was considered an irreligious act for the Muslims to enroll in the British Army. He wrote about his extensive tours of the subcontinent during the period extending from October 1920 up to his arrest for Karachi trial on September 1, 1921 in which he was awarded two years rigorous imprisonment.  The statement given by Muhammad Ali before the court brings out his truly Islamic spirit. He acknowledged the supremacy of the divine law over the man made legislation. He roused the Indian masses from their idleness and infused in them a new political consciousness.  (e) In the last chapter the writer has talked about the Islam. He discussed that what is spirit, science, and religion and what are the different era's of Islamic history. He has discussed that how Islam was spread to the different parts of the world after the initial stages. At the end he said that it was his duty that he must share the truths of Islam, which he has learned, with his fellow being. He closed this book with the citation of a short chapter from Quran in which the prophet life has been briefly reviewed and the duty he (Peace be upon him) owes to Allah for his mercies.   <br />Evaluation<br />4. In this book, Muhammad Ali has given very lengthy facts of his individual experiences and a statement of his position and attitude towards Islam. He never meant to write the present book. He started with the life of the Prophet and ended with his own. Later out of the four parts of the original book only the first was complete that too in a scattered form, however the editor has tried to adhere to the original text. There were no chapter and no sub-headings. References to Quranic and various other quotations was either provided or verified. Footnotes were added and occasional gaps were filled up by the editor to make a sequence. The editor has done a great job and if some one wants to learn about the Islamic aspect of Muhammad Ali, then he must read this book.   (1020 words)	2001-07-01

This investigation was aided by sponsorship from National Geographic, because they wanted this discovery to appear as the Christmas 1999 cover story.  The resulting perspective of this dig proved that Jesus' influences were not rural but more urban.  The board of National Geographic eventually vetoed the idea of this story for Christmas because they found it too controversial.  Why?  <br />Then, I read &quot;The Christ Conspiracy&quot; and what was always a suspicion was verified.  True, Acharya S does get a little opinionated, which disturbs those who are looking for a more academic type book, but maybe she wants to get her subject in our face.  And why not.  The persecution of other groups of people, especially the Jews, based on some one who really did not exist, is an abomination.  <br />I have read books on biblical archaeology and Jesus studies for years.  The Dead Sea Scrolls, the Q Document, the Nag Hammadi Library, books by Karen Armstrong and Elaine Pagels.  This book condenses a lot of the studies into a single volume and reveals the evolution of our current religious milieu from our ancient archetypes.  <br />And as one of the other reviewers stated, &quot;the truth will set you free.&quot;  The combination of those two books produced an emotional response that did set my mind free.  <br />It was perfectly obvious why the board of National Geographic was against the article and why most of the major religions are not sponsoring archaeology digs in Israel.  It is not that they are afraid of finding something that will refute the Bible; it is the fact that they will not find anything proving that Jesus existed, which has been the condition thus far.  <br />So, in Sepphoris, Herod's Galilean capital, within walking distance of Nazareth, nothing has been found placing Jesus in his supposed location.  And, Acharya S' and other scholars' hypotheses are proven true.  And the conspiracy continues to be bolstered, even by National Geographic.	2001-06-24

The more I know much about Nazi Germany (and take my word for it,  I hate the Nazis),  the less I accept &quot;the Goldhagen thesis.&quot;  Further,  the more I know,  the more I believe that anti-Soviet Eastern Europeans played a larger role in the Holocaust than has been publicized.<br />I'm not saying that the Nazis didn't engineer the death of 5.2 to 5.8 million people. However,  Goldhagen's assertion that Germans bear common guilt for this tragedy is likely inaccurate. Consider these facts (which can be verified at the US Holocaust Museum web site):<br />Even Jews in Poland and Hungary didn't know about the death camps until, perhaps, 1943-44.  Because they didn't know,  they didn't resist the closing of the ghettos.  The Warsaw ghetto uprising (April 1943)was a direct result of Jews first learning about the existence of the death camps.<br />The murders were accomplished secretly under the ruse of  resettlement. The Germans hid their true plans from citizens and inhabitants of the ghettos by claiming that Jews were being resettled in the East. They went so far as to charge Jews for a one-way train fare and often, just prior to their murder, had the unknowing victims send reassuring postcards back to the ghettos. Thats why millions of Jews went unwittingly to their deaths with little or no resistance.<br />While there were over 100 &quot;concentration camps&quot; in Germany and occupied Eastern Europe,  six of them were &quot;death camps&quot; (Belzec, Chelmno, Sobibor, Treblinka, as well as killing sections of Auschwitz-Birkenau and Majdanek-Lublin concentration camps) where mass exterminations were carried out, usually in gas chambers.<br />All six death camps were located in rural areas of Poland,  far away from the German population.  The closest one was over 300 miles from Berlin.<br />For 10 years of Nazi rule,  being sent to a concentration camp didn't necessarily mean death. Many German Jews went to concentration camps and then were released if they promised to emigrate.<br />The vast majority of executed Jews were not Germans.  Most German Jews emigrated before the Holocaust began.  Most of the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish Poles, Ukranian, and Russians who had faught against the Nazi invasions.  To most Germans,  they were not just Jews,  they were the enemy.<br />Membership in the SS was over 50% non-German.  Ukranians,  French,  Belges, Hungarians---all volunteered to be members of the &quot;Elite Echelon&quot;.  The Einsatzgruppen relied heavily on local partisans (particularly in Eastern Europe) to locate Jews and carry out the massacres for them.

Sharp analytical and electronic skills at the dawn of the microelectronic age made it possible, and at a time when casinos weren't paying much attention to the threat posed by this emerging technology. Those days are gone forever. The casinos finally wised up around 1983.    Bass has done a great job of telling the story of how a couple of physics postgraduate students and their friends develop tiny computers controlled by toe switches enable them to achieve an edge over the casino at roulette.    This was particularly poignant for me, because I independently developed similar wheel-clocking methods and verified a 26% advantage over the house on a rented casino quality roulette wheel in 1976. The 'device law', which Nevada passed in the early 80's in response to people attempting to use technology to sack their coffers, largely put an end to concealed computers in casinos. Those to whom a felony rap is no deterrent are presumably still at it, using extremely advanced and difficult-to-detect hardware.    Bass' story is a fascinating read and highly reccommended.	2001-06-16

Epistemology, the study of what can be known, has been all but abandoned in the modern era of philosophy. Beginning with Kant's revelation of the limits of what can be known by rational consciousness, the (rationally based) project of Western philosophy gave up on its prospects for ultimate knowledge. Since it couldn't see beyond the capacities of the rational mind and the realms of the real that higher levels of consciousness could disclose, it resigned itself to the more limited task of evaluating &quot;empirical&quot; data, that is, data disclosed by the senses. Only that which could be disclosed by the senses was deemed &quot;really real,&quot; even though the language, mathematics and logic that were used to process the empirical data are not themselves disclosed by the senses.<br />In &quot;Eye to Eye,&quot; Ken Wilber applies his spectrum of consciousness model to epistemology. Each of the realms in the spectrum (grossly simplified as body, mind, spirit,) according to Wilber, can be investigated in accordance with its own nature, or with the appropriate &quot;eye.&quot;  That is, the &quot;eye of flesh,&quot; the &quot;eye of mind,&quot; and the &quot;eye of contemplation.&quot; Investigation of one realm with the eye of another produces, at best, a limited, or representational, understanding (as Kant pointed out with respect to the eye of mind), and at worst, what Wilber calls &quot;category error.&quot; Attempting to investigate the realm of spirit, for example, with the &quot;eye of flesh,&quot; that is, the eye that perceives only sensory phenomena, will not yield real knowledge of the realm of spirit, which is not disclosed to sensory perception. This results in errors like &quot;empirical&quot; science, which purports to recognize only sensory phenomena, declaring the realm of spirit to be nonexistent or at least non-verifiable, because it can't be &quot;seen.&quot; Well, it can't be seen unless you look with the right &quot;eye.&quot; Wilber explains why it is critical that the proper &quot;eye,&quot; and the corresponding modes of investigation and verification, are used to investigate, and establish validity claims in, the various realms in the spectrum of consciousness. More importantly, he says that all these realms can indeed be known, and that the validity of such knowledge can be tested and verified by the same &quot;scientific&quot; method now applied to the material and rational realms, provided the proper eye, and the proper verification protocols, are used. This consitutes nothing less than a breakthrough in the logjam of modern epistemology.<br />Wilber builds on this core material by exploring some of the promises and failures of the &quot;New Age&quot; movement and presents an outline of his concept of structure, stage and self, the mechanics of the evolutionary development of self. This volume also presents seminal material on what may be Wilber's most original and influential contribution to thought, the &quot;pre/trans fallacy.&quot; Wilber says that many thinkers confuse pre-rational stages with trans-rational stages because both are non-rational. This results in either elevating the lower stages (babies are enlightened, hunter/gatherers were more &quot;at one&quot; with the universe, etc.) or diminishing the higher realms (enlightened sages are schizophrenic, confusion of higher realms with repressed lower ones, etc.)This compounds the likelihood of using the wrong eye to investigate particularly the higher realms of the real.<br />&quot;Eye to Eye&quot; is probably not the book to begin with if you have not read any of Ken Wilber's work. It is rather technical and does not contain a very good overview of his thought system, which may make it more difficult to fully appreciate this book. I recommend &quot;A Brief History of Everything&quot; as the best Wilber primer, and Wilber himself recommends the new &quot;A Theory of Everything.&quot; However, &quot;Eye to Eye&quot; is indispensible to more dedicated students of Wilber's work and, I would argue, to any serious student of epistemology.	2001-05-31

Books by Samuel L. Blumenfeld are also highy recommended for understanding the current K-12 education ills.<br />Now a little bit of my personal journey: I first read this book five years ago when my children were in elementary and junior high schools. This book broke all my romanic thoughts about public schools. I verified with my children concerning the things mentioned in the book. My children confirmed that many things said in the book indeed took place in their schools. I was very alarmed at this. Because of this I tranfer all my children to a priavte school. I cannot allow my childern to be damaged psychologically or taught wrongly. My children are my treasure.<br />Read this book! Protect your chilren.

In particular, Sagan refers in Chapter 7 to the world of Europe during the time of Pope Innocent VIII (was ever a personage more ironically named?) in which &quot;perhaps hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions&quot; of people were tortured and burned at the stake and/or dismembered or otherwise killed for being witches or for consorting with demons and other imagined agents of Satan (p. 122).  Sagan wants to remind us very lucky citizens of the twenty-first century just what it was like in the middle ages when the nature of truth was decided by the coercive power of authority and not by observation and evidence.  Where would we be without science? is the question of the book, and Sagan's title is the startling answer.  We would still be in the dark ages.<br />But what is this magical &quot;science&quot; that makes all the difference in the world?  It is common sense codified and repeatedly tested.  Instead of accepting the existence of demons or aliens or Satanic conspiracies based on reports from people, the person of common sense asks to SEE the demons.  She wants proof of their existence, and he wants that proof verified by others.  Sagan has what he calls a &quot;baloney detection kit&quot; (pp. 210-211) in which he has science confront new ideas.  This kit includes &quot;independent confirmation&quot; of the &quot;facts&quot;; the idea that &quot;arguments from authority carry little weight&quot;; the possibility of falsification; and the use of Occam's Razor.  Virtually everybody reading this review knows what Sagan means by these terms.  The astonishing fact, and one of the key points of his book, is that the overwhelming majority of people in this country and throughout the world do not.  The even more astonishing fact is that even some people with college educations are not clear about the need for evidence and independent confirmation of evidence before one can say that something is true, and knowing even then that this truth is only a tentative conclusion, forever subject to being overthrown by new evidence, evidence that might arrive tomorrow.<br />Many people are dissatisfied with this and want absolute certainty.  But what Sagan is at pains to say is that such &quot;certainty&quot; is never forthcoming in this world.  Such certainty is the province of religion.  An integral part of the human condition is to realize and accept the fact that we cannot have absolute certainty, that the best we can have is a candle in the dark, and that candle is science.  Without it we have an arbitrary truth, a truth of, by, and for authority.  And that kind of &quot;truth&quot; can hurt you if you happen not to be on the side of authority, or happen to fall out of grace with the powers that be.<br />The question arises, why is the method and the logic of science a mystery to so many people?  Sagan's answer is, it isn't taught in school.  This book is an attempt to right this wrong.  He would like to see the scientific method as part of our grade school curriculum, and see it continued on into college.  I would add that science is not intuitive.  It is not politically correct.  It is politically neutral and sometimes it is amazingly anti-intuitive.  People who make their living primarily with their political and intuitive (i.e., social) skills tend to be the ones most threatened and most ignorant of science.<br />Another question is, why do so many people still believe in demons and devils, aliens and astrology, Loch Ness monsters and dragons in the garage (a title of one of Sagan's chapters) when the overwhelming weight of evidence is against them?  Simple: we humans have a need to believe.  This need can either be satisfied with religion, or fairy tales from, e.g., the National Enquirer, or by the wonders of science.  Sagan would like to see the wonders of science get more play bothon the tube and in our classrooms.  He, like the current Pope, believes that science and religion can co-exist.  Of course this comes as no revelation to me, since I believe that properly understood, the stuff of religion must always be taken as symbolic and as a guide to how to live.  The literal interpretation of religious ideas and the insistence on absolute truths always leads to trouble, contradictions and eventually to an untenable position which must be defended with brutal force.  Sad to say.<br />Sagan examines many of the delusions of our times, e.g., alien abductions, the face on Mars, UFOs, creationism, astrology, telepathy, channeling, psychic healing, New Age fuzziness, etc.  In Chapter 9, entitled &quot;Therapy,&quot; Sagan deals with satanic ritual abuse charges, &quot;recovered&quot; memories of sexual abuse, the remembrance of previous lives, even memories of future lives (!) thought to be &quot;uncovered&quot; by some therapists.<br />This book is a celebration of science and an examination of the world of pseudoscience, why it exists and what can be done about lessening its negative effect on our lives.  Sagan celebrates the wonders of science and the discoveries of science while warning us against the dangers inherent in pseudoscience.  As a man who is as comfortable writing for Parade Magazine as he is addressing the National Academy of Sciences, you can be sure he is both easy to read and worth reading.

I have read &quot;The Cancer Cure That Worked&quot; by Barry Lymes which is the story of Dr. Royal R. Rife's work.  Barry was assisted by Dr. Rife's partner, John Crane of San Diego.  I spent a couple of afternoons with Mr. Crane in 1990, before he pased away.  Because Mr. Crane was acting as a co-author the book is very accurate as to the actual truth and history of the events.  Dr. Rife did have a technology that worked and was verified by the Medical Staff at University of Southern California, L.A.  Dr. Milburn Johnson, the then Chief of the USC Medical Staff and President of the Los Angeles Medical Association rented the Scripps Ranch at La Jolla, California, where they were successful in curing, within 70 days, 18 terminally ill cancer patients - 100% cure rate! All with no side effects!  They were then able to build approximately 20 &quot;Rife Ray Beam&quot; machines and Drs. were using them very succesfully, in fact, too successfully, until the persecution of Rife and his associates quashed the project and technology for a while.  THIS BOOK IS ONE EVERY HUMAN ON THE PLANET SHOULD READ BECAUSE THE TECNOLOGY CURED NOT ONLY THE CANCER BUT OTHER PROBLEMS THE PATIENTS HAD.  ANOTHER BOOK THAT IS A MUST is &quot;The Secret of Life&quot; by Georges Lakovsky, who used the same technology, but a different design of a machine he called &quot;The Multiwave Oscillator&quot;  He also experienced very simalar successes as Dr. Rife.  Mr. Lakovsky's book contains &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; photos.  He was from Russia and did his work in France.  Mr. Lakovsky was merely murdered, when he came to New York, to squash his technology. However, both technologies are available via the underground and I have personally used Rife's and witnessed it to cure cancer, epstien barr, clogging of the heart arteries, to correct eyesight,toothache and other ailments.  A similar technology is explained in Hulda Clark's book &quot;Curing All Diseases&quot;  I'm sure Mr. Bird's Bookabout Mr. Naessens should also be on the &quot;must&quot; list.

Patrick Glynn's book asserts that good evidence for both God's existence and survival of death herald &quot;the twilight of the old [materialistic, secular] paradigm.&quot; He writes in his Introduction that the &quot;embrace of atheism did not bring joy&quot; and adds that he &quot;clung to the hope that I might be proven wrong.&quot; His first-chapter attempt to prove himself wrong employs the cosmological &quot;anthropic principle.&quot;<br />This principle says that slight changes in the laws of physics would have prohibited the universe from developing us as its observers. Glynn therefore concludes that the &quot;laws of physics were fine-tuned from the very beginning of the universe for the creation of man.&quot; However, employment of the anthropic principle for theism creates another design argument for God's existence with the same pitfalls as its previous versions.<br />This cosmoanthropic version says that something capable of producing human life must have been &quot;fine-tuned&quot; by a tuner, to whom we give the name &quot;God.&quot; However, the premise that the physics laws were tuned begs the question, for we do not yet know why these laws are just as they are. Furthermore, if something capable of producing human life cannot be self-tuned but must have been tuned by a tuner, then God must also have been tuned by a tuner. But this infinite regression of tuners of tuners is not wanted by most theists. Also beset with difficulties is Glynn's employment of near death experiences(NDEs) in support of spiritual survival of death.<br />The paramount question is not whether NDEs seem objectively real but whether individuals can interact with the physical world during NDEs in a way that can be independently verified. The out-of-body experience (OBE) associated with NDEs might facilitate such independent verification. But a century of unsuccessful tests have shown that self-induced OBEers cannot affect anything from paper suspended on a string to high-tech instruments. But even if OBEers fail to affect physical objects, do we have any good evidence that they can obtain knowledge from the physical world? Glynn thinks we do.<br />The problem, however, is determining what someone knows only via an OBE. Controlled tests to correctly identify objects remote from bodily view during self-induced OBEs have yeilded equivocal results, and what NDEers &quot;see&quot; during OBEs -- such as their bodies with medical personnel and equipment -- occurs during medical crises when such controls are not usually in place. The difficulty, then, is that one must have good grounds for ruling out &quot;information available [to the NDEer] at the time [of the NDE], prior knowledge, fantasy or dreams, lucky guesses... information from the remaining [bodily] senses [during the NDE]...selective memory for correct details, incorporation of details learned between the NDE and giving an account of it, and the tendency to tell a good story&quot; (Susan J. Blackmore, Ph.D, &quot;out-of-Body Experiences,&quot; The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal, ed. Gordon Stein, Ph.D. [Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1996] 478-482). Moreover, NDEers, having gone through medical crises, &quot;could have used sensory cues such as hearing, touch, or pain [because] [s]uch cues are known to provide information during anesthesia...In one study 85 percent of the patients recalled hearing noises or conversation,...40 percent felt pain, and a third recalled seeing something [during anesthesia]&quot; (Blackmore).<br />Of course, the above critiques of Glynn's evidence do not absolutely prove his thesis wrong. But they do show his evidence is weak and that scientific questions for which science has not yet provided good answers are not solved by theology. Presentations of weak evidence, however, are the best parts of his book, for he has littered it with baised denigrations against atheism and secularism.<br />Glynn cites, for example, the &quot;pyramid of severed heads&quot; ofthe French Revolution and asserts that it was &quot;inspired by the purest atheism.&quot; However, a 13th century illustration in William of Tyre's Les Histoires d'Outremer of Christian crusaders catapulting Muslim heads over besieged city walls condemns Glynn's assertion to the trash bin of propaganda. Indeed, the common ingredient in destructions of civil societies is neither theism nor atheism but fanaticism. Eric Hoffer makes this point in his classic book, The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements.<br />To conclude, believers had better hang on to their faith rather than Glynn's evidence, and we all had better watch out for any kind of fanatics reaching for the reigns of power. As for Glynn's great &quot;paradigm shift,&quot; it seems to be coming more from the winds of popular sentiment than from the data.	2001-05-26
US	53038410	R1A8H3PLUJ2UTK	0738201243	526655195	The Search for Life on Mars (Helix Books)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Not as easy as you might think	This book is a little like \\"Here be Dragons,\\" (Koerner, LeVay, Oxford University Press, 2000) and \\"Rare Earth,\\" (Ward, Brownlee, Copernicus, 2000) except that it is more focused and specific than the others.    While Koerner, LeVay, Ward, and Brownlee consider the possibility that life exists outside the solar system, Walter limits the scope of his book to the question of whether microbes exist, or once existed, on Mars.  <br />Life outside of earth has never been unambiguously observed and verified.  Consequently, discussions about the possibility of life beyond earth inevitably begin with thoughts about how life originated here.  There seems to be an emerging sense that life is the result of a universe that is naturally self-organizing (Stuart Kauffman is in this camp.  See his book \\"At Home in the Universe, Oxford University Press, 1995).  According to this point of view, life is all but certain to arise on any planet having the basic chemicals and physical conditions found on earth 4 billion years ago.   Given this hypothesis - that life arises quickly and naturally in the proper environment - it's natural to ask if any other planets in the solar system have (or had) the necessary ingredients.  If they did, we should look to see if life evolved there.  Since there is growing evidence that Mars had a distant past with some of these conditions, it seems more and more important that we look for life on Mars.  Finding evidence of life there would buttress the concept that life readily evolves given the proper environment.  Obviously, if that's the case, it holds enormous consequences for modern science.<br />Walter has a nice chapter on the tree of life, and describes recent information showing that \\"all the lowest branches of the tree are occupied by hyperthermophiles.\\"  The discovery that life exists on earth under extreme conditions (like those of deep-sea thermal vents) has increased the hope among scientists that it might also have evolved and flourished on Mars many thousands of millions of years ago.  He also shows how genetic transfer between species happens today, and was probably common among our earliest ancestors, so that the whole concept of a \\"tree of life\\" becomes somewhat tangled during the earliest stages of the evolution of life.  Instead of a tree, the topology looks more like a web, with the roots of the tree (consisting of Bacteria, Eucarya, and Archaea) rising out of this web.  <br />The expectation of finding evidence of life on Mars depends on the type of environment that Mars supported in the distant past, and the circumstances under which life arose on earth.  It also depends on how easy it is to ascertain the evidence of fossilized ancient microbial life.  It turns out that identifying evidence of microbes in very old rocks is a pretty hard thing to do.  To illustrate this, Walter describes the difficulty of identifying stromatolites in ancient rocks.  This was new information for me, and a real insight into the nuts and bolts of making these sorts of identifications.  I'd thought that stromatolites were easy to identify, but in the very oldest rocks, they're not.   When identifying stromatolites in rocks 3000 million years old, there can be (and often is) a great deal of controversy regarding the conclusion.  Walter's point in making this so clear is that stromatolites are large colonies of microbes, yet even they are not unambiguously identified in the oldest rocks.  The problem of identifying evidence for individual microbes in rocks 3000 to 3500 million years old is even tougher.  The point being that even with Martian rocks in our hands, it's not going to be easy to affirmatively state whether there is evidence of ancient life on Mars.<br />To drill the point home, Walter points to the fact that we do have chunks of Martian rocks on hand, in the form of bits and pieces that have been blasted off the Martian surface by meteorite impacts.  Walter describes in detail the scientific examination of some of these rocks, and one, in particular, identified as ALH84001.  This meteorite made world news when a team of scientists reported finding evidence of ancient microbes buried inside it.  Walter describes the initial reports, the objections, and the eventual state of limbo in which these conclusions came to rest.  This helps set the tone for expectations regarding the difficulty against which such analysis will proceed even when we manage to return samples from the Martian surface using spacecraft.<br />In describing how scientists make conclusion about the presence of microbes in ancient rocks, Walter does a real service by illustrating the importance of convergent evidence.  Identifying ancient microbes involves more than one type of observation.  It involves many types of converging data, including visible observations of deposits in rocks, the types of rocks involved, and things like carbon isotope ratios (not to be confused with carbon 14, which decays far to quickly for analysis in 3000-million-year-old rocks).  Along these lines, I noticed a recent article in Photonics Spectra (May 2001) describing the use of Raman imaging to identify microfossils - another tool, in the search for the ancient life on earth, and possibly on Mars. <br />The book ends with some very informative discussions about proposals for future landing sites on Mars, for sample analysis and/or return.<br />This is a very informative book, with useful insights into the way science works, complete with several pages of color plates, a useable index, and short list of further reading material.  If you are interested in what NASA does, and how the scientific search for life on Mars is (and will be) carried out, I think you will like it.  I certainly did.	2001-05-25

If you want a \\"nerd-inspired\\", tech-oriented \\"how to make money on the Internet\\", don't buy this book. <br />This is a book written for entrepreneurs who want to take advantage of what the Internet offers in terms of reduced marketing costs, broader reach, inexpensive frequency of message dissemination, and the cumulative impact of marketing and advertising on the web. In other words, practical solutions to making money on the net. <br />I have read more than two dozen \\"how-to-market-on-the-Internet\\" books.  They seem to fall into one of two categories: (1)Basics 101, written for a plumber or a grandma who just learned how to turn her computer on; and (2)books written by those 'baseball-hat-turned-backward' types who will 'html'-you or 'browser' befuddle you to death with arcane terminology, or whack you upside your head with a bag of zeros and ones. <br />Bob Allen's book is right in the middle. It's not a basic primer on the Internet. Nor is it a techhie wonderland that assumes you have at least a Masters in computer science. This is a book for people who already know something about how to operate on the Internet, but have not yet been exposed to all the pros and cons of the various methodologies present today. There are still lots of pundits out there who try to sell you banner ads, classifieds or other ... you just don't need, because they just don't work. Bob has done a great job of demystifying some of these sacred web cows, and in detail, explains just how to make things work. His main concern is to demonstrate how,if carefully thought out and planned,almost anyone can make a lot of money on the Internet. <br />I've been on the net for over three years, far too many hours per week to admit to.  I though I knew most everything there was to know about marketing on the web. I walked into a book signing and thought I'd at least give him a listen. I picked up a copy of the book, and quickly flipped through it. Then, as I listened, some of the ideas Bob was sharing with his audience struck a responsive chord with me and helped me see how to solve a major marketing problem I had been wresting with for weeks. Bingo, the answer dropped into place. Other things he stressed, simply verified my own thinking. Needless to say, I walked out of there with a copy under my arm. <br />If you want to understand HOW to do it, and you want to learn what NOT to do before you waste money, this is an excellent book for you.	2001-05-24

This very readable and forthright autobiography covers the first 26 years of life of one of the leading American molecular biologists. The rich fabric of its story is told in part in beautiful letters. His recollections reflect both, a lifetime of incisive analysis and the mellow philosophical perspective of a septuagenarian. This multifaceted memoir can be read at varying levels of depth, reaching from the unencumbered experience of a middleschool student to the sophistication of a postgraduate, and it adresses a multitude of aspects of social and intellectual life. Though chockful with historical detail, it presents common and personal occurrences and opinions with humor, irony, even satire, and it is at least in parts breathtakingly thrilling.     The first part of the book describes the author's upbringing in a partially assimilated, reform Jewish family. Starting out as an unexpected and spoiled addition to two older siblings, Stent evokes the social and cultural life enjoyed by well-to-do femilies in the  German capital Berlin during the 1920s Weimar regime. Bereft by the tragic illness and death of his doting mother, the boy is increasingly consternated, isolated and frightened by the rapidly unfolding official anti-Semitism of Nazi Germany, and he is imprinted with the terror of the Nuremberg progromes and the 1938 Kristallnacht. With father and siblings already abroad, the 14-year-old and his stepmother embark on a dangerous, illegal escape that leads them to safety.    Having finally reached Chicago, the adolescent, essentially on his own and pitifully poor, completes his schooling and strives for a college education. The cultural change left him totally unprepared for dealing with coeds, in whom he is now greatly interested. He starts out more or less undetermined in his search for a woman and a career, and he learns to grab and eventually finagle opportunities. As member of a government technical branch, he returns in 1947 to Germany and his beloved , now war-torn Berlin, but having the power of both an American uniform and American cigarettes.     Back home in the US, he struggles with the excitement and intellectual challenge of reseaarch, its potential fame, and the parternalistic sociality inherent in a research career. The latter's cost is deferment of a mature sex and love life. This dilemma and his racial victimization affirm his self-perception as a &quot;lucky self-hater.&quot; Despite his passionate sexuality, he is in his relationships with women enotionally unresponsive, undecided, or at times (he says) a cad. Unwittingly, he victimizes the &quot;other&quot; but, in the final analysis, again himself.      The last part of the book sets forth the beginnings of molecular biology, in which Stent participated as an early member of Max Delbrueck's groupon bacteriphage research.     Though lacking literature references, the book's historical data appear to have been verified during the author's 1985-1991 research fellowships. Stent's autobiography is more thoughtful than James Watson's &quot;The Double Helix,&quot; of which Stent has been a renown critic. Stent perceives science as a sociocultural activity and addresses both its lofty ideals and its flaws. A major topic is anti-Semitism and the arrogance that feeds into it. Stent conveys to his readers an understanding of its many faces and of the sociocultural evil of any racism. By pointing out the splinter in his own, the victim's, eye, he proves that it is humanly almost impossible to be totally free from racism.     Biophysicist Stent does not embrace the reductionism prevailing in molecular biology. He seems to warn of its dangers to the emotional development and humanization of budding scientists. Knowing that modern physics contradicts the subject-object separation time-honored in biological thinking, he commits himself in his memoir to being both.     My favorite piquantery among the many in his recollections is a play with an allusion of his first name with Wagner's Gunther. It leads to a summary, rather self-deprecating evaluation of his scientific merits (pp.15-16). Scientific papers begin customarily with a summary of the salient points: here, the image of the great &quot;hero&quot; scientist will be rejected. Rather, Stent wants to be perceived, warts and all, as the protagonist of his bittersweet story.	2001-05-22

Suddenly the story became much less predictable and I was intrigued.  This was not your standard hothouse flower character (regardless of the century) who found herself in a bad way and depended on her father or lover to help her out.  She took total responsibility for her actions.  Not the martyr, this girl.  I am impressed, Ms. Shreve.<br />All considered it's an interesting story with some pretty three dimensional characters, no one's totally good or evil.  There are also some great courtroom scenes.

Their central argument intrinsically had no chance of ultimately satisfying either the religious believer nor the village atheist. Both will finish &quot;Why God Won't Go Away&quot; and remain steadfast in their convictions. I am of the former persuasion but conceded long ago that God is totally Other. Many Judeo-Christians adherents recommending this book seem unaware that their theological tenets contradict the possibility of proving the existence of God and the Supernatural via empirical methods. Thomas Aquinas taught that the human individual on this side of the grave can reach the Divine only through faith. The Dominican scholar strongly argued that reason is of great value in ascertaining the reality of the universe created by God, but the Lord Jehovah remains hidden from our sight. St. Augustine for the most part shunned the hard sciences. Instead, the earlier Church theologian premised his insights upon the existential needs of all human beings to find meaning in a cold and uncaring universe. The dilemma remains forevermore because the possible dimension of the Supernatural cannot be verified with any degree of certainty by our five senses.<br />The studies referred to in this book prove nothing. In many respects, the authors seem more in tune with New Age ideology than traditional theologies. Learning more about both how the brain responds to near death and alleged mystical experiences merely increases our intellectual frustration. Karl Popper warns us that our widely held theories are often tentative, and may be contradicted by new facts in the future. Paradoxically, we become humbler as our knowledge increases. The sophisticated inhabitants of the 21st Century laugh at the naivet&eacute; of the ancient Egyptians for their peculiar explanations of the body's internal organs. During the process of mummification, the embalmers threw the brain away perceiving it of no significance whatsoever. Alas, it is intellectually arrogant to believe that our modern day speculations are significantly better.<br />Should one therefore conclude that this book is a waste of time? Of course not. Andrew Newberg and the Eugene D'Aquili are highly trained medical practitioners. Their area of expertise allows them to minutely study the physical aspects of human brain activity. Such study is to be encouraged. It is of mandatory necessity in treating various brain diseases, and aids us in learning how to overcome mental exhaustion and trauma. The authors indirectly address the false dichotomy between mind and body which has inhibited our research since the time of Rene Descartes. More recently, the inane nostrums of the Logical Positivists added to our confusion. &quot;Why God Won't Go Away&quot; merely needs to be taken with a huge grain of salt. I still give it 4 stars.las, it is intellectually arrogant to believe that our modern day speculations are significantly better.<br />Should one therefore conclude that this book is a waste of time?

In this book, he and Devincentis differentiate among three different categories of customer (Intrinsic Value, Extrinsic Value, and Strategic Value), explaining why (and how) the cultivation and solicitation process for each must be &quot;customized&quot; (pun intended) in direct response to their respective needs and interests. The common element (as always) is value. What is it? How can it be verified? How can it be increased? And perhaps one of the most important but least understood questions: So what?<br />What Rackham and Devincentis correctly assert is that when sales are flat, declining or even increasing, it is imperative to &quot;re-think&quot; whatever sales strategies and tactics are now used. (Here's a situation in which the SPIN framework can be especially helpful.), And do so in terms of HOW value is pereceived by each customer. Those perceptions are the most urgent sales realities. It is also important to remember that today's Intrinsic Value Customer may soon be motivated primarily by extrinsic or strategic considerations. The authors offer an intellectual infrastructure within which to ask the most important questions about sales. Although the same questions must continue to be asked, many (most?) answers which are correct today may soon be inadequate, if not flat-out wrong. How well you think and then re-think will determine how well you do.	2001-05-17

What may not be so obvious is the relationship between this concern and the idea of organic evolution.<br />Cornelius Hunter delves into this realm with his recent book, Darwin's God. (Brazos Press, 2001)  Subtitled `Evolution and the Problem of Evil,' this work of just under 200 pages takes a close look at the arguments usually put on the table in support of the evolutionary paradigm.  At their heart, as Hunter points out, these thoughts are not so much evidence for evolution but are arguments against Creation.  This being the case, as the thought goes, since creation cannot be supported, evolution wins by default.  In essence these things are classic `straw man' arguments.  Hunter, described on the book's cover as a student at the University of Illinois working on a Ph.D. in biophysics, points to argument after argument and shows that these are generally drawn up in response to an individual's particular view of God, and how God works or doesn't work.   Having constructed this view, nature is studied and found to not harmonize with the preconceived notions.  Therefore any creationary perspective must be wrong; at least incorrect.<br />There are nine chapters in this book. They are: (1)-Where Science Meets Religion,  (2)-Comparative Anatomy, (3)-Small-Scale Evolution, (4)-The Fossil Record,  (5)-One Long Argument, (6)- Modernism before Darwin, (7)-The Victorians, (8)-Evolution and Metaphysics and (9)- Blind Presuppositionalism.  <br />What Hunter has done is to elucidate something most thinking scientists have long recognized. It is that at the heart of this discussion about ultimate origins rests a number of metaphysical concepts.  As these have been pushed further and further away from public consideration, they attract less and less attention until we arrive at the present hour when they are completely absent...and people think the debate is (incorrectly) about science vs. religion.<br />By coming to grips with the foundational thoughts of so many in the evolutionary camp, (both now and in the past) scientists can more honestly address the real concerns.  \\"Many wonder,\\" says Hunter, \\"why evolutionists make such high claims of success while the theory incurs scientific difficulties that would do away with most theories. The answer is that evolutionists find their confidence not in positive arguments for evolution but in negative arguments against the modern idea of creation. When evolutionists claim that a particular scientific observation proves their theory, they are not committing the fallacy of affirming the consequent of the premise they wish to prove, rather, they are denying the consequent of the premise they wish to disprove. Evolution is proved not because it is verified but by the process of elimination.  As Ernst Mayr wrote...it must be admitted that Darwinism has achieved acceptance less by irrefutable proofs in its favor and more by the default of opposing theories.\\" (Toward a new Philosophy of Biology, Harvard University Press, 1988)<br />Hunter concludes by comparing the teaching of evolution with the statement issued some years ago by the National Academy of Sciences, a statement which stated that only `science should be taught in science classes.'   \\".... the evolutionists become their own judge,\\" says Hunter.  `The only possible conclusion is that evolution should not be taught in science classes, for Darwin's theory goes far beyond \\"scientific observation, interpretation, and experimentation.\\"  It includes religious presuppositions outside of science.  Evolutionists argue that homologies and small-scale changes in species can only be explained by evolution, and that the fossil record makes evolution a fact.  Evolutionists come to these conclusions because they believe in a certain type of God and creation, beliefs that are not open to scientific debate.\\"<br />\\"Ultimately,\\" says Hunter, \\"evolution is about God.\\"<br />Hunter's book is an easy read and is one which any student of science, especially students working toward a degree involving biology would want to read.  It should be required reading in any high school or college biology class.  Sadly it probably won't be. Not that the things said are untrue but that they expose the sinking sand upon which so many in science have built their houses. To expose the sand is to expose the heart of those individuals choosing to ignore God.<br />April 2001	2001-05-17

Everytime it finds a comfy space on my shelf, a friend gets a hold of it and away it goes. Suffice to say, it changes those who read it. Fundamentalist christians and athiests alike find the research of Dr. Stevenson deeply disconcerting and for good reason. When people think of reincarnation evidence it's usually the hypnotic-regression fantasies which share the bed with alien abduction. But Dr. Stevenson's research is as far away from that as you can get. Imagine if your 4 year-old suddenly mentioned that he liked you better than his old parents and told you that he lived on a ranch in New Mexico. You would probably think his imagination was getting the better of him. But if he provided details which you later verified, how would you react? This scenario has indeed occurred in reality and has done so many times as the research of Dr. Stevenson shows. When reading this book remember a few things. Dr. Stevenson has outstanding credentials. He never jumps from point A to point C. If there is no B he admits so. And all of these cases involve deceased persons. No child has reported being someone who is still living or from the future(which weakens psychic ability as being a cause of this phenomena). And lastly, if reincarnation exists, and I believe Dr. Stevenson's research suggests so, what does that say about human consciousness and our place in the universe?	2001-05-13

I'd known about rumours about the configuration of the continents, Milankovitch's astronomical cycles, variation in sun output, changes in ocean currents, and so on, for some years, but I really needed a detailed analysis of the historical arguments, and the more recent evidence as to why these changes in the earth's climate occur. This book answers just about all I needed to know, as well as being a good study of historical science. It was some time before all the pieces began to fit, and there are still some unexplained aspects, such as why the 100,000 glacial cycle is stronger than the 20,000 and 40,000 year cycles. Also, early arguments revolving around the Biblical flood are enlightening.<br />This book details all the theories, and the history behind their development. From deep sea radiolarians, to terraced reefs in the equatorial regions, to vegetation studies in Europe, to the level of snow on Ethiopia's mountains, to axis and ellitpical variations in the earth's orbit, to the gravitational effect of the pull on the earth from other planets, to oxygen isotope studies, to graphs of variation in thermal energy, temperature and sea level at different lattitudes-both expected from Milankovitch cycles-and actual from deep sea analysis, this book pretty much covers all you need to know. The only drawback is it has missed a few recent ideas in the 1980s to 1990s, but the story was pretty much over by then. Pretty conclusive evidence is detailed on how regular and episodic variations in the earth's orbit around the sun trigger periodically cooler climates than at present. These have been particularly strong in the last 1.5 million years or so, which is thought to do with the configuration of recent continental geography. In the last 7,000 years the tmeperature has dropped around 2 degrees, and will continue to drop over the next several thousand years at least, albeit very slowly, if it wasn't of course for the already verified greenhouse warming. Unfortunately, being published in the late 1970s, the book has not captured much of the recent data and debate concerning the greenhouse effect, but is nevertheless an intriguing and enlightening expose of earth climate variations.<br />The other thing which struck me just a little, was the fact that the major ice age periods in the earth's past have been at or around 3 interesting changes or developments in evolutionary history-the Permo-Carboniferous (ie Permian-Triassic extinction), Pre-Cambrian (multicelled organisms), and Quaternary-Recent (hominids). Certianly the hominid succession has been mostly within major changes in the earths climate, including significantly colder periods, and vast ice sheets across northern lattitudes. Maybe coincidental, but something to think about.lbeit very slowly, if it wasn't of course for the already verified greenhouse warming.

Verification and validation are two important, if often misunderstood, aspects of delivering the big three: Reliability, Availability and Support.  One of the reasons for this is technology has outstripped methods, which is what this book rectifies.  V&amp;V is not pre-production testing where the goal is to break the application or product, but is a functional qualification test (also known as user acceptance test or product test), where the goal is to ensure that what you have meets requirement specifications. Specifically, verification answers &quot;did we build the right thing?&quot; and validations answers &quot;did we build it right?&quot;<br />It's one thing to perform V&amp;V for products and monolithic applications and quite another to apply these techniques to more complex systems.  This book updates the V&amp;V body of knowledge by showing how to perform V&amp;V in objected-oriented and distributed environments, with an emphasis on specific system types such as data warehouses, inter- and internet systems, etc.<br />The authors start with a description of processes, models and standards that give you a foundation for incorporating V&amp;V, and then discuss tools and methodologies, documentation and metrics.  I especially liked the metrics provided, which will allow you to effectively and accurately measure your V&amp;V process.<br />Another strong point about this book is that it addresses objected-oriented methods, which are difficult to verify and validate.  Here is a real life example why:  a global 50 company bought into a directory-enabled security scheme as the basis for their enterprise security. Such schemes are object-oriented and complex. At no point did the company verify or validate what they were buying into, either as a concept of the component products.  Worse, the consulting company that &quot;sold&quot; it did not have any design proofs which could be verified and validated, nor did the consulting company or the global 50 company develop any structured acceptance testing.  Net result:  there is a large company that is betting the security of its internal and external applications on an unverified and unvalidated security scheme.  The information in this book would have given both parties a structured approach with which to ensure that what looks good on paper actually works when you implement the design, especially with products that bring with them their own set of flaws. I cited this true story to underscore the value of V&amp;V and to show how often it is not used for mission-critical systems.<br />The coverage of complex system types and development approaches in this book is must reading by anyone in QA, especially if QA is only performing pre-production testing.  V&amp;V is a necessary stage in the development (or procurement) process to ensure that what is eventually going into production conforms to what was specified.  If your organization does not perform V&amp;V then this book is all the more important, and will give you the processes and approaches to integrate it into your QA organization.  If you are a QA practitioner who is currently performing V&amp;V this book will provide techniques and approaches that will help you meet the growing challenges of verifying and validating increasingly complex systems.

Zoya was nineteen when she volunteered as a battlefield medic. Inspired by a female machine-gunner in her regiment, she gradually learned the operation of the Maxim. Until she was wounded in action, she served in the elite 25th Chapeyev Division. The author published her memoirs long after the War and her subsequent marriage, under both her surnames, that her record with the Division be easily verified. Zoya's memoir was never intended for Western audiences, but only for general interest of Soviet citizens and fellow veterans. Nor is it propagandic. &quot;On the Road to Stalingrad&quot; contains none of the political agrandizement intended to inspire troops to greater achievement, as was the case with frontline newspaper exploitation of heroes such as sniper Vasiliy Zaitsev or ACE Lilya Litvyak. Indeed, Smirnova-Medvedeva's memoir was not even published until 1967, and its straight-forward and rather humble account of the unsuccessful battles for Sevastopol and Odessa contain no &quot;superhuman&quot; feats of heroism. The author downplays her own achievements, instead paying personal, and sometimes moving, tribute to her comrades. Thanks to the recent efforts of a Canadian Slavic Studies professor, K.J. Cottam, this obscure but fascinating memoir has been made available in English translation. It provides Western readers a rare eye-witness glimpse of the Soviet experience of World War ll -- what Russians call the Great Patriotic War.	2001-05-06

Book Review of:  SECRETS OF THE ILLUMINATI By Doc Marquis  (Serving as Series Volume #5 (of 43 series volumes) of The American Focus on Satanic Crime)<br />Bibliographical Information:  &quot;Secrets of the Illuminati (The American Focus on Satanic Crime&quot;, Ser.Vol. 5) by Doc Marquis, Bndr/Tape-Vinyl Bound 8-1/2 x 11 Edition Paperback, (200+ Pages with Designs, Illustrations and Complete Details) <br />Publisher Data:  USCCCN/American Focus Publishers <br />Published in 1994 - Completely Revised for 2001<br />ISBN: 1-877858-66-8 <br />Ordering Information: Order Directly from Amazon.Com<br />The Author's Stated Purpose of Book:  Doc Marquis is a former Satanist who was trained in the Plans of the Illuminati, before God called him out. Therefore, Doc fully reveals much detail which is given orally only, and never, ever written down. Most of what this &quot;insider&quot; says is and has been overwhelmingly verified by other Occult writers, although such verification is always sketchy, with no meaningful detail. Unlike the others authors and researchers, Doc Marquis gives such first-hand, &quot;first-person&quot; detail in this &quot;big&quot; book in excess of 200 pages, complete with diagrams, illustrations and full details.   <br />Also included are a host of references to other works of interest to readers and researchers interested in the Illuminati, the New World Order, Masonry (Freemasonry) and much, much more, all which are available from Amazon.Com, such as: <br />*The Illuminati's (DECODED) Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion;  *America's Occult Holidays; *Frontmen of the Illuminati; *The Illuminati's New World Order; *Signs and Symbols of Satan; *Arrival of the AntiChrist; *The Inner Circle of the Illuminati; *Memoirs of a Former Illuminati Witch *Also available: Satanism in Prisons<br />Key Points:  1) The New World Order cannot be established except through the powerful exercise of witchcraft, Black Magick witchcraft; <br />2) The New World Order can be established only through the &quot;exceeding sinfulness of sin&quot;; in other words, only through the most horrific of sin can this global order of Antichrist be established; Doesn't that sound like 20th Century history, and today's society? <br />3) Doc Marquis draws, from his own memory, the official Illuminati symbol of the various forces working globally to bring about the New World Order. You will be shocked to see the organizations, entertainment, and churches on this Seal; <br />4) America's leadership of this Kingdom of Antichrist is well discussed; <br />5) You will learn the truth about Rock-N-Roll and &quot;Christian&quot; Rock-N-Roll; <br />6) The role of Freemasonry and the Roman Catholic Church is also fully discussed; <br />7) You will discover tremendous details about Black Magick witchcraft, and then you will be shocked to discover how much of it is being displayed so prominently in our entertainment. <br />Significance of The Book and the Contribution Book Makes:  This book gives the kind of detail which only an insider, a former Illuminist, a Black Magick Witch can provide. <br />Is Information Presented New and Valuable?    Yes! To the highest degree and then some!  It is the one &quot;MUST READ&quot; for the New Millennium.<br />Verification From Other Sources:  Other occult sources give hints at these facts, but without the documentation and in-depth detail that Doc Marquis provides. <br />Recommendation:  We highly recommend this book to anyone who is truly interested in the full truth. You will truly never look at this Country, the Strategic Placement of U.S. Government Buildings, Monuments and streets in Washington, D.C., your Daily Newspaper and Media, or your One Dollar Bill (with its Two Great Seals) the same way again.	2001-05-04

This book fails to prove its contention that FDR knowingly and specifically set the fleet at Pearl Harbor up for destruction. <br />Stinnett claims a memorandum from intelligence officer Arthur McCollum--a mere lieutenant commander--was the genesis of a policy of provocation by FDR against Japan.  However, when read, it becomes apparent the actions recommended in paragraph 9 are normal military, political and economic contingencies leveled against aggressive nations, not a plan of provocation.<br />It is McCollum's paragraph 10 statements that surprise.  &quot;If by these means Japan can be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better.  At all events we must be fully prepared to accept the threat of war.&quot;  If one reads the first sentence and discards the second, it sounds quite damning.  Taken together and in the context of the previous five pages, it becomes apparent McCollum feels even the least action is likely to provoke war and if Japan makes the first move, the US can get on with the inevitable business at hand.  This makes the excerpted eight actions much less a provocation and much more a measured and prudent response to impending war.<br />Besides misconstruing McCollum's intent and influence, Stinnett incorrectly states that all eight proposed actions were executed and that they originated with McCollum.  However, proposals to use British and Dutch naval bases predated McCollum's October 1940 memo, having been promulgated in War Plan Rainbow Two of September 1939.  They were never carried out.  The &quot;Base F&quot; Stinnett refers to was an Army--not Navy--project, and consisted only of lengthening Rabaul's runway to permit Trans-Pacific ferry flights of B-17s to the Philippines.  The U.S. Fleet was held in Hawaiian waters from May 1940, and the Dutch were refusing Japanese demands for oil even as the memo made its way up the chain of command in Washington D.C..  Clearly, McCollum did not originate these ideas.<br />Stinnett also attempts to claim two cruisers (one heavy and one light) normally assigned to the Asiatic Fleet, and one light cruiser passing through as a convoy escort to the Philippines constitute fulfillment of McCollum's proposal to send a division (typically 4 ships) of (specifically) heavy cruisers to reinforce the Asiatic Fleet.  This proposal was indisputably not acted on.<br />Stinnett states that provocative &quot;pop-up&quot; cruises by U.S. cruisers were carried out, even into the mouth of Japan's Inland Sea.  But the log entries Stinnett cites reveal both logged cruises were in U.S. controlled waters along the route to Australia.  As for the supposed foray to the Inland Sea's mouth, there are no log entries, only unverified claims of a Japanese hydrophone contact in that busy waterway repeated to and by the U.S. ambassador.<br />Stinnett's work is written from the assumption that his thesis is true, not from clear supporting evidence indicating it is true. He repeatedly fails to conclusively establish a trail of evidence to the necessary decision-makers, much less FDR. He fails to synchronize time lines or clarify chains of evidence and action (or inaction), and his technical knowledge is rudimentary.  <br />Stinnett also never provides adequate information to check claims of radio direction finding &quot;fixes&quot; establishing the presence of Japanese carriers in the North Pacific.  He only gives one exact bearing in the entire book, when it requires three to &quot;fix&quot; each intercepted signal to a geographic location.  The track chart provided is a reconstruction from memory and could thus be a complete fabrication.  Nor do the bearings surface in end notes.  If this crucial information exists, it's squirreled away with Stinnett's papers in an archive and withheld from the reader.  Why?   The intercepted transmissions supposedly originated from Nagumo's carrier force during its approach to Pearl Harbor.  However, the Japanese say the ships sailed with their transmitters deliberately disabled.  Stinnett produces no Japanese witness to dispute this.  Nor does he quote the signals or give dates and times for their transmission and receipt.  He gives total numbers of intercepted transmissions from Nagumo during the period of 15 November 1941 to 8 December 1941.  As this includes the 10 days prior to the carrier force's departure and imposition of radio silence, one is forced to wonder if there actually were any transmissions between 25 November and 7 December--the only dates which would establish the striking force's track.<br />Stinnett transparently bridges logical and evidentiary gaps with assumption and sloppily relies on the verbal recollections of positively discredited sources.  Worse, his end notes display a consistent and disturbing pattern.  Virtually every paragraph which raises a contention, allegation, charge of treason or piece of new evidence bears an end note in the seemingly appropriate place. But referencing the end note too often produces unrelated material, trivia, or original context that flies in the face of Stinnett's theory. <br />The suspicious pattern of end-noting severely damages Stinnett's credibility, as does his &quot;I've got a secret&quot; handling of his &quot;discoveries&quot; and his failure to quote them. The general aire of disingenuousness is completed by his claim that his host of traitors are patriots and the ends of their alleged actions justified the means.  Yet his ostensible purpose is to bring out the truth for aggrieved survivors of Pearl Harbor casualties.  Say what? <br />One is led to conclude this contradiction exists to shield the author from the (quite appropriate) legal wrath of the families of the men he claims committed treason in a work that is only remotely scholarly and too thoroughly sensationalistic speculation. <br />&quot;Day of Deceit&quot; is not enlightening, not proof, and not reliable. Read it with extreme caution and careful attention to what is not said, what is said vaguely, what is deceptively cited, what is not shared, and what can be explained more readily by a better mundane explanation.	2001-05-03

Incredible documentation showing that the Bush family have long been involved in deep corruption involving greed, drug dealing, assanitions, selling chemical weapons to Iraq,lying to the people with no challenge from the media.   These allegations have been corroberated many times and almost rocked the country with Gary Webb's cia story. Later verified by the cia 's own admission in volume 2 released on October 7, 1998.   The media continues to protect the Bush's and their criminal empire and Russell Bowen quitely shocks the underground almost a decade later. The comments of Ross Perot to George Bush about pows in Veitnam are also to true. After Perot came back from  a   search mission from Veitnam, only to find out that Richard Armitage and the cia were abandoning American pow's to protect a drug running operation.    After Bush was elected president in 1988 Perot formed a group called United We Stand and organized the reform party.   He ran for president and constantly attacked Bush, but never Clinton. He never brought up the drug running because of ridicule  from the cia dominated media, but knocked Bush out of the office!     Russell Bowen's incredible documentary will continue to live  on and he will keep a low profile like any smart person in his position would. God bless him.	2001-04-26

I'd also like to add that this book is dangerous. Can you imagine finding it funny that a friend or relative was killed? But this willingness to laugh at the misfortune of others, however insensitive that is, is not the main reason this book is dangerous. The danger lies in the pseudo-science behind the &quot;removing themselves from our gene pool&quot; nonsense. At one point, the author talks about a Sleepy Smoker Gene, referring to people who die after falling asleep next to their lit cigaratte. Does she honestly believe that such deaths improve our gene pool? This is the problem with all these stories. Darwinism has nothing to do with any of this! (If you have any doubt, read The Origin of Species, which talks about how it takes thousands of years, at least, for species of plants and animals to vary. Darwin never uses short-term human behavior to back up his theory.) However, a certain regime that rose to power in 1930s Germany did believe in the pack of idiocies known as 'Social Darwinism.' They also were greatly entertained by human death. I am certainly not putting the author in this camp, as she seems to be writing with a sense of black humor, not cruelty. But unfortunately, she is using pseudo-science to advance a very dangerous idea. Please pause to think about this for at least 24 hours if you intend to buy this book.	2001-04-23

Education is no exception.  The dysfunctional result from public schools appears more a consequence of politicized bureaucracy and an either indifferent or confused citizenry than from lack of resources.  (suggested reading:  _In_Pursuit_ by Charles Murray or _Inside_American_Education by Thomas Sowell.)  <br />As tools, computers remain cranky if useful devices -- an observation made from running Fortran code in highschool and college since the mid-1970s on Univac, CDC, PDP, SGI, HP on a plethora of operating systems.  The code gets fancier, and memory faster to access, but it's no panacea.  The medium is too narrow for anything but task-specific operations, and very frustrating as a learning portal, irrespective of baud rate.  <br />Dr Stoll's conversational style perhaps fills the pages more than necessary, but his critics are unable to refute his arguments against the superficial and unverified content of the Internet debases research or the distracting nature of visual graphics advertised to facilitate learning or the wretched quality of current software development and computer ergonomics or the expensive maintenance of equipment that's obsolete when manufactured, never mind installed.  <br />The hype from electronics promoters neglects to mention the advantages of durable media -- primarily books (with text).  This failing is evident even in scholarly studies, such as _Integrating_Information_Technology_in_Education_ that exhorts yet more electrons knocked from their p-orbital shells to placate the god &quot;nolij&quot; but no understanding or mastery that comes from self-discipline and investigative study.  _High_Tech_Heretic_ serves as an appropriate counterweight to this latest and expensive fad.	2001-04-19

The book relies heavily on dated case studies of pioneering companies that were successful in the mid 90's. Buzzwords such as \\"eyeballs\\", \\"page views\\", and \\"stickiness\\" were used in this book to show the craze and the fascination the author and society had with the potential of the Internet in the mid 90's as a marketing tool. Some of the companies mentioned did indeed start off brilliantly. However, the realization that profitability is the key to business, coupled with various legal and ethical issues has tarnished (or bankrupted) these same companies. <br />However, the book certainly has its great moments. Some of its predictions of how Internet will change the face of economy continue to hold true. The Internet has brought unprecedented convenience and information to the consumer and that is shaping businesses everywhere. People can now buy cars and airplane tickets online anytime and almost always at a lower price. This eliminates the job functions of a travel agent or a car salesman. Phenomenon similar to that will continue to happen as the Internet is reshaping the way people do things. The question still remains \\"What are the appropriate methods and the path to profitability?\\" The prediction that Internet has made the world smaller and that it's evolution will be a global matter has also proven to be true. Indeed, the greatest growths in Internet commerce are taking place in Asia and Europe. It's common to see today's Hong Kong cinema glorifying the \\"Net Geeks\\" and twenty-something dotcom millionaires. These exact same things were glorified in the American media in the early to mid 1990's.<br />In conclusion, I felt the visions painted in this book are mostly valid. However, in light of the current economy, some of the \\"successful\\" methods and case studies done by the author to support his points are not. The writing style is very easy to follow and I would recommend this book as a first read to anyone wanting to bring his or her physical business virtual. The book summarizes the Internet's potential as a marketing tool. Yet, how to successfully tap that potential remains to be verified.	2001-04-12

This is unfortunate, because the most valuable aspect of this book is Griffen's description of how our economy really works. As described by Griffen, the movements of the economy and the stock market make total sense. I see &quot;experts&quot; on TV all the time saying, &quot;Whenever the market has done X in the past, Y has usually followed,&quot; but I've rarely seen anyone make a statement as plain as Griffen's: when the Fed increases the money supply, the economy ALWAYS expands, and when the Fed decreases the money supply, the economy ALWAYS contracts. And the Fed has complete control over the money supply. True, it takes some time for the Fed's actions to have their effect, but they ALWAYS do, just as pushing down on one end of a lever inevitably pushes the other end up. Anyone who doubts this need only compare the history of the Fed's rate changes to the history of the US stock market over those same years (something I verified on my own). The Fed's manipulation of the money supply is the single greatest factor affecting our economy and our investments, and no one EVER explained it to me.  By comparison, my college Econ classes were fairly useless.<br />Mingled in with his description of how our economy works, Griffen ascribes motives to the players, depicting the Fed as the centerpiece of an international banking cartel. The author ably demonstrates that the recurring bailouts of companies, banks, and governments cost ALL of us an extraordinary amount of money, and that most of this money ultimately ends up in the pockets of the large banks' major stockholders, though some is funnelled off to corporate executives and third-world governments. The author further demonstrates that the IMF and World Bank are using fiat money to siphon wealth from the rich nations to the poor ones, often enabling third-world dictators to remain in power. Even if you're not prepared to accept the author's premise that this is all INTENTIONAL, you have to accept his account of how it's all working out in practice.<br />If you DO accept the conspiracy theory, then the degree to which we're all being manipulated is infuriating.  Our wealth is being appropriated without any due process, to benefit companies and governments to which we have no allegiance, and which are in many cases engaged in activities that we find morally objectionable. We have become the tools of evil without even knowing it, and there's little that we can do about it. Most of the suggestions that the author makes at the end of the book seem nearly impossible to implement, with the notable exception of voting the &quot;big spenders&quot; out of our federal government. I doubt Congress could really be motivated to abolish the Fed, and I doubt that Congress would seriously consider returning to a gold standard. Perhaps the best solution for each of us is to recommend this book to a few friends, in the hope that we can educate enough people to force the cartel out into the open where it can be caged and destroyed.<br />BTW, I was a bit dismayed at the author's anti-environmentalist stance. He argues that environmentalism is being nourished by the cartel as a &quot;boogey-man&quot; to replace war as motivation for people to accept hardships without complaint. He seems to think that environmental concerns are largely fabrications, part of the larger conspiracy. I have directly observed enough environmental desecration in my short life to know that these concerns are NOT fabrications, but very real threats. That's not to say, of course, that the environmental threat doesn't aptly serve the cartel's purposes. Wars, after all, are very real too, but they serve the cartel's purposes brilliantly.	2001-04-12

She reigned during the time of Columbus, in the late 1400s.  Also, it was started because the Jews allied themselves with the Moors, who were trying to conquer Spain.  The Jews were infiltrating the government by pretending to be Catholics, thus obtaining good positions in the government and the Church.  Queen Isabella had to take action.  The trouble was, she did not want to make innocent, honest Jewish converts suffer trouble because some others were traitors.  She borrowed the Inquisition Courts from France, who was using it against the Manicheans.  (A whole different story there.)  It did get out of hand for a while, but Tomas de Torquemada, who was elected the Grand Inquisitor, managed to clean up the process quite a bit.  If someone was accused of being with the Moors, the accusation would have to be verified by at least two other witnesses.  Then, if it was so, the suspect would be taken and asked questions pertaining to theolgy which were designed to trap those who were not really Catholic.  If the suspect was proven beyond a doubt to be allied with the Moors, they would be kept in a prison and given every opportunity to renounce their claim with the Moslems and convert.  (They would be asked to convert because that was the only way that could come close to guarenteeing reform.  Back then, a person's word meant something.)  If the suspect agreed to convert he would walk away a free man.  <br />During this time, as I said before, the prisoners were kept in a special Inquisition jail.  However, it was quite civil, in fact many common criminals would pretend to be heretics just to be put into the Inquisition prisin, which was a lot nicer than their own.  If the suspect refused to convert, he would be handed over to the civil authorities, and would probably be burned at the stake.  If you have a problem with this, take it up with Isabella.  She is the one who did the burnings.  All in all, unbiased, non-Christan historians estimate the total death toll to be 2000-5000.  <br />The Inquisiton did have some benefits.  The Witch Trials were investigated by the Inquisition Court and were proven groundless.  This saved many lives.  In England and Germany alone 130,000 people were killed by these &quot;trials.&quot;  Also, Spain went a long time without a relgious war, because of the religious unity in in that country.  Yes, there were problems in it, but the good results outweighted the bad.<br />I recommend &quot;Characters of the Inquisition&quot; for a deeper reference.	2001-04-06

Nyman's 1974 classic is here reprinted sans revisions.  Brilliant!  It captures a moment -- as Nyman concludes his preface, \\"Thank goodness I wrote it when I did.\\"  EM is not a survey of 20th century avant-garde music.  It focuses on one trend, inaugurated by Cage, Wolff, Feldman and Brown in the 1950s, a trend which explicitly attempted to overturn the traditional avant-garde then marching under the banner of total serialism.  Nyman contrasts Wolff to Stockhausen, then a leading serialist:  \\"Stockhausen is speaking of an unwanted situation needing to be remedied by his intervention, Wolff of a situation he is quite happy to accept, leaving sounds to go their own way.\\" (27)  As Cage says in his \\"Silence,\\"<br /><br />\\"Not an attempt to understand...  Just an attention to the activity of sounds.\\"<br /><br /> One of the great strengths of Nyman's short book is his careful attempt to define experimental music before he moves on to discuss the artists and their music.  To summarize and paraphrase, he says experimental composers are excited by creating \\"a process of generating action,\\" involving situations or fields delineated by compositional rules, but leaving them open to the performers. (4)<br /><br /> Experimental music is uncompromisingly radical, and represents an ongoing influence on creative music, but has certainly not become any sort of popular movement.  So for instance, while the early \\"minimalists\\" Young and Riley were arguably part of the experimental tendency, as were Reich's early phase patterns, (and hence are included here by Nyman), the later works of Reich, and especially Glass, are no longer open and experimental.  And while Eno and recent techno/ambient artists have been influenced, their innovations have been more technical than conceptual by comparison.<br /><br /> My recommendation if this sounds intriguing -- check out anything by the English free-improv group AMM, which is nowadays constituted by Eddie Prevost on percussion, Keith Rowe on guitar and electronics, and John Tilbury on piano!<br /><br />(verified library loan)r and electronics, and John Tilbury on piano!<br /><br />(verified library loan)	2001-03-28

I expected serious analysis, and by that criteria would give it 1 star.  If what you're interested in, though, is an eclectic encyclopedia of interesting 20th century musicians, loosely grouped by the theme of \\"ambience,\\" which is never defined, then you might think this is great.  (I can't comment on the fact-checking criticism, but to me it's a secondary point.)  Prendergast moves from \\"high art\\" composers including Debussy and Stockhausen, to \\"minimalism,\\" to rock, broken into categories such as psychedelic, krautrock and synthesizer music, to the '90s techno/house/drum&bass/ambient trend.<br /><br /> However, his definition of \\"ambient\\" involves \\"music being deconstructed\\" by Mahler and Debussy (sounds really \\"postmodern,\\" but what does it mean?), and developments in technology/electronics, along with an \\"interest in pure sound.\\"  He pronounces:  \\"[T]he bleeding heart of electronic progress had by its very nature rendered all recorded music, by definition, Ambient.\\" (4)  Given this sort of cosmic perspective Prendergast could have included all music, and what he does include seems to be more or less \\"cool stuff that I like.\\"  Harsh, I know, but does Bob Dylan's \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door,\\" by any stretch of the conceptual imagination, belong on a list of the Essential 100 Recordings of 20th Century Ambient Music?  If so, our author fails to offer any explanation.  How about Led Zeppelin IV (ie, ZOSO)?  I'm at a loss.<br /><br /> If the book was appropriately titled, I would have much less to criticize.  But when you title a book \\"The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age,\\" you lead the reader to expect some sort of theoretical analysis -- what sort of evolution?  In what direction?  What mechanisms are involved?  But there is \\"no there there\\" if what is happening is just technological progress, and \\"an interest in pure sound\\" may characterize Cage's famous *4'33\\"* (the silent composition), but there is not even an attempt here to argue that it is the direction of 20th century music.  If Prendergast really means to emphasize the use of music as background, where is his discussion of Muzak, and music in advertising?  He doesn't develop his embryonic theme(s), but rather rushes headlong into profiles of musicians, which are strung together with little connecting analysis.<br /><br /> Caveat emptor -- if you're looking for serious analysis, look elsewhere, but if you want a breezy journalistic encyclopedia of non-mainstream music (that is seen as cool by The Wire magazine) you might find this a useful reference work.

This absolutely fascinating and rivetingly true story is perhaps the only verified account of paranormal activities ever photographically documented with clear, crisp images.  But...these images were taken by Ted's mind...and he was never  in view of the objedts that came out on the film!  Written by psychotherapist Dr. Jule Eisenbud, M.D., the book details the incredible events which occurred between Dr. Eisenbud and his patient, a Chicago hotel doorman named Ted Serios over a period of several years. What makes the story very believable are several facts - Firstly, Ted Serios was an alcoholic with a penchant for bar brawling, comfortable as a hotel doorman and not in any way a person seeking a new career; secondly, he was a very reluctant patient and was never a publicity seeker; and thirdly, he dissapeared abruptly one day and was never seen again by Dr. Eisenbud, ending the scientific experiments forever. If Serios was a true publicity hound or trying to create a &quot;Vegas Lounge Act&quot;, he would have gladly stayed with the exposure Dr. Eisenbud was giving him.  and Dr. Eisenbud himself comes across as a serious and dour scientific investigator in no way trying to sensationalize his amazing find.<br />Ted Serios was brought to the attention of Dr. Eisenbud by someone who heard of Ted's incredibly spooky gift of producing photographic images with his brain. Dozens of examples of the photos are in the hard-cover book.  Among the most amazing shots are three that will forever remain embedded in my mind - one, a &quot;photo&quot; of a building as taken by Ted's mind set in the 19th century next to a modern one produced traditionally of the same building.  You can clearly see the modifications made over the years from one photo to another; two, several pictures of cities which have never been successfully identified as anywhere on Earth (!); and three, a photo of the backs of what appear to be American Revolutionary War-era soldiers climbing an incline or hill. All of Ted's pictures were produced under highly scientific conditions with the subjects requested in advance.  Eastman-Kodak and Polaroid representatives were present during many of the experiments to load cameras and ensure against trickery.  In one series of experiments, camera company representative handed Ted a series of sealed cameras which they loaded, and Ted was then placed nude in a room devoid of all furntiture.  he was still able to produce his &quot;mind&quot; pictures on film!<br />For those interested in the paranormal and X-files fans, I highly recommend they obtain and read this facinating and eerie book. Ted Serios was so special, so unique, that no one, even Dr. Eisenbud, had time to fully comprehend Ted's gift before he dissapeared forever - a truly unique mind found and lost.All of Ted's pictures were produced under highly scientific conditions with the subjects requested in advance.

The author claims to base his book on fact, but I have yet to see any of that. He offers quotes, but gives no sources, and quotes that CAN be verified are often out of context. His boring and cliched biographical descriptions of the Nazi hierarchy seem awfully trite, and the character relationships make no sense. On one page Geli loathes Hitler, the next, she adores him. One paragraph portrays Hitler as a sniveling weakling, the next as an overbearing tyrant.<br />In short, this book is NOT based on fact, but rather on rumor, supposition, and gossip. I give it two stars for the sole fact that it makes for an off the wall story. Hansen clearly does not understand the mind of Adolf Hitler, and bases his portrayal of the man on the ugliest and least-validated rumors he could scrounge up.<br />If you're looking for a perverted, twisted, almost pornographic story, you may enjoy this book. If, however, you are trying to better understand Adolf Hitler the man, then by no means use this book as a source. You would be much better off buying one of the excellent biographies of him, which, although also biased, at least use FACTUAL information to back up their suppositions. This book is utterly worthless.	2001-03-22

Upon noticing something new, others try to replicate the results.  When they do, scientists start to feel confidence that reality has been established.  When the results cannot be replicated, doubt begins to build.  Sometimes, the innovator made a mistake.  Sometimes, the emulators don't quite understand what needs to be done.  And occasionally, the innovator made up the results in the first place (like the little boy who cried &quot;wolf&quot;).<br />This book focuses on parts of the career of Professor John Heslop Harrison of Newcastle University, who was a famous botanist in the British Isles during the first half of the 20th century.  Over his career, he had discovered or been present when many rare species had been found in new places.  While many of these discoveries were replicated by others, many of the ones he made on the private island of Rum (also spelled Rhum) in the Hebrides did not have that replication.  Some botanists became suspicious, and encouraged a talented amateur botanist, John Raven, to inveigle an invitation to Rum to see the specimens.  What he saw led Mr. Raven to conclude that someone (possibly the good professor) had planted these specimens on Rum, rather than occurring there naturally.  Based on these researches and a letter to &quot;Nature,&quot; the professor's discoveries that others could not document were gradually withdrawn from the scientific literature.<br />The book looks at the whole problem from our time now.  The author interviewed people who were alive and participating in the controversy then, as well as examined the documents and letters involved.  He turns up a series of questionable &quot;discoveries&quot; also including butterflies and beetles that suggest a systemmatic pattern.  In a final amusing aside, he visits the professor's home and is amazed to discover that the postal address he used for it is false.  He chose to pretend he lived on the most fashionable street in town, when he did not.<br />The circumstantial evidence (and it is hard to have more, unless you see someone literally planting the specimen) does get a bit tedious, but the author does a nice job of considering the motives behind scientific frauds.  Generally, they are tied to a desire to make a big breakthrough, and the &quot;scientist&quot; is convinced the theory is right . . . even though the evidence don't show it yet.  In Professor Heslop Harrison's case, he wanted to build a new theory of the evolution of species and also wanted to change the view about how the last ice age had occurred in Britain.  These &quot;discoveries&quot; tended to support those theories.<br />The book's approach is quite a thorough one, and since Mr. Sabbagh is not a botanist he makes the book more understandable to those of us who are not.  He also as a wry sense of humor that makes for comic relief throughout the book.<br />On the other hand, reading exhaustively about weeds, beetles, scientific controversies, and whether the samples were received or not is dull.  Although well written and fascinating for its broader implications, the writing style left my mind wandering a bit.  If the book had been written to about 70 percent of this length, it would have been more appealing.  Many of the letters could have been edited down or included in the appendix material.  I graded the book down one star for being cumbersome in this way.<br />As to what really happened, no one will ever know for certain.  Certainly, the weight of the evidence suggests to me (a nonscientist) that sloppiness at least was involved in some cases, and possibly conscious fraud.  If no one ever turns up these specimens again (and they haven't in decades in some cases), the preponderance of the evidence will favor their never having existed naturally in the sites claimed.<br />Where else do we rely on claims that are hard to substantiate?  How can we defend against &quot;false&quot; claims occurring?  Mymind is drawn to SUVs as an example.  Many people originally bought these believing that they were safer alternatives to smaller vehicles.  No one discouraged that view.  Recent statistics suggest that people in SUVs are more likely to be injured than people in some smaller cars.  How could a misperception like this have been established, and how could have been allowed to persist?  It seems like some people will pay with their lives, as a result.<br />Look for independent information, well verified by others who have no vested interest!g?

US	49576835	R1IBVV8IRAYSX6	031218199X	848183939	Unholy Trinity: The Vatican, The Nazis, and The Swiss Banks	Books	1	95	156	N	N	Don't believe everything you read . . .	Some readers may conclude that the arguments advanced in this book, that the Vatican collaborated with the Nazis during World War II and then helped Nazi war criminals escape justice after the war, are true because it cites many declassified documents from the National Archives and books written by other authors. However, close scrutiny reveals that the authors simply use evidence that fits their preconceived thesis and ignore tons of other evidence that refute their claims.  A key source of information in the book are intelligence reports by the Office of Strategic Services (O.S.) and other agencies. Yet information in these reports is often anonymous; it is uncertain if the subject is an important official with direct knowledge or just someone repeating a rumor.  The authors make no mention of an Italian journalist named Virgilo Scattolini. From 1939-1948, he made a valuable living by selling false information about Vatican affairs to intelligence agents, diplomats and reporters. Through his non-existent contacts in the Vatican, Scattolini claimed he got his information, which often reported verbatim what Pope Pius XII said to visitors in audiences. In 1944, the O.S. enlisted Scattolini, paying him $500 per month. He regularly fed them false reports about Vatican goings-on. Scattolini was also used by other intelligence agencies from other countries as well.  In 1948, Italian Communists published two volumes of Scattolini's reports in &quot;Documenti segreti della diplomazia del Vaticano&quot; (&quot;The Secret Diplomacy of the Vatican&quot;). Scattolini was then exposed, arrested and jailed for six months. As Vatican historian Rev. Robert Graham, S.J. said, reports based on Scattolini's lies can be found in the various archives, thus creating a minefield for researchers.  Several of  &quot;Unholy Trinity's&quot; major scoops can be traced to Scattolini. The authors write that the Vatican and Nazi Germany made a secret deal over Ukraine in 1942. If this was true, then there would be evidence in Nazi archives, but there isn't. The source behind this story is Scattolini. Loftus and Aarons also use Scattolini's reports that invent damaging conversations between the Pope and one of his deputies, Msgr. Giovanni Montini, the future Paul VI. The book's claim that Montini was an informant for American intelligence is also based on Scattolini's work. The authors consulted Fr. Graham for the book, and he warned them about &quot;the Scattolini factor.&quot; Yet the authors used the material anyway, dismissing Graham's warning. Scattolini and the embarrassment he caused the O.S.S. are discussed in several books, Graham's &quot;The Vatican and Communism&quot; (1996), Bradley F. Smith's &quot;The Shadow Warriors&quot; (1983) and Owen Chadwick's &quot;Britain and the Vatican during the Second World War&quot; (1988). Scattolini's file extends to 1,500 pages and can be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.  The authors claim Bishop Alois Hudal, with the support of the Vatican, ran an operation that smuggled Nazis to South America. Hudal did help several Nazis escape. However, as Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal wrote in a letter to the New York Times in 1984, there is no evidence that the Pope or his advisors were aware of Hudal's activities. The book claims that Hudal was close to the Pope. In fact, Hudal had no authority at the Vatican and just served as the rector of the German Catholic Church in Rome. The fact that Hudal was never promoted to cardinal suggests that he and the Pope did not enjoy a close relationship. Hudal's memoirs were posthumously published in German in 1976. Hudal claimed Vatican officials shunned him because of his pro-Nazi sympathies.  Loftus and Hudal also cite Croatian priest Fr. Dragonovic, who worked with American agents to spirit war criminal Klaus Barbie out of Europe. Dragonovic may have helped Croatian dictator Ante Pavelic escape as well. To support their case, the authors argue that the Vatican andCroatia were on friendly terms during the war. However, they ignore several facts.

I bought this book in 1997 thinking I could use it to feed my Mexican-American husband.  It served its purpose in a way - it taught me what NOT to do.  Authentic Mexican food doesn't have fourteen different kinds of salsa.  It has one, the ingredients and preparation style of which vary with regional availability and family tradition.  Authentic Mexican cooking doesn't involve making chilaquiles with the water from cooking black beans.  Real Mexican food isn't gigantic vegetarian tamales baked in the oven as a casserole. Real Mexicans warm up their tortillas by laying them on top of the plain, unromantic modern gas burner - certainly not by steaming!  (Husband: &quot;why are the tortillas soggy?!&quot;) Real Mexicans don't put zucchini in their fideo.<br />I could go on.  I realize part of the stated purpose of this book is to expose readers to the cuisine of the various regions of Mexico, different from the northern Mexico/Southwest U.S. type stuff my husband and I grew up with. If you are really interested in that kind of thing, I would advise you to take the money you would have spent on this book and start saving for a trip to go see those places for yourself, at which point you will realize that it is no more possible to make the regional specialties of the Yucatan using mail-order delicacies and a bestselling American cookbook than to make a moon rock out of Philadelphia cream cheese.  After you've been playing around with cookbooks for a while, you start to get a feel for how much of the fancy stuff is genuine pursuit of excellence and how much is just upper-class pretentiousness.  Maybe Bayless really did get the ideas for his recipes on his many trips to Mexico, but if so I suspect that most of it was from the Mexican counterparts of the fashionable restaurants he runs in Chicago.  To pretend that the fanciest and the most obscure must also be the most authentic is snobbery, and applying that idea to a culture other than your own borders on cultural chauvinism. I verified this for myself first hand when we visited his restaurants in Chicago and the only Mexicans in view were the valet parking guys. It's the rich folks' version of Chi-Chi's.  If you are in Chicago, go to one of the little hole-in-the-wall taquerias where the waitresses don't speak English, and get some real Mexican food.s snobbery, and applying that idea to a culture other than your own borders on cultural chauvinism.

Science is limited by its methods of experience and observation.  By themselves, these methods will never undermine God because they are incapable of reaching to and understanding the first cause of the cosmos; nor will they ever. But even Aquinas knew that. The main point of the book is that modern scientific revelation of God is consistent with His revelation in scripture, and their combined victory over the falsities of tradition. The book fails, however, when it assumes that since ultimate reality is unknowable beyond revelation that, therefore, the author's view of reality by default (sola scriptura/fundamentalism) is the only reality left to be known. Just because the Bible exists does not, in itself, constitute proof that it is true. Clearly, the truth of anything can only be determined by an appeal to something outside the thing itself. \\"The Christian should believe the Bible because it is true...\\" but scientific method alone is not enough to vindicate the entire Bible. One needs something else. Faith yes, but how deep is the faith of a believer if it would succumb to unverified myth?  The author sites the Reformation as a victory of scientific method over tradition, but, in making experience the litmus test for truth, the Reformation also opened the flood gates for the `modern'. Unencumbered by tradition, the `modern' can rationalize any reality he wants to experience. The Bible is not unlike any other historic document in the sense that, if it is true, it lives by virtue of a tradition deriving from an actual event. The veracity of any document is only as good as the strength of the tradition of the observations that produced the document. Undermining that tradition doesn't help make it true. The Bible was derived out of tradition and it is with respect for that tradition, which this book has little use for, that it can only be known and verified as true.	2001-02-27

This book represents an incredible effort that can only be described as a labor of love and a gift to all Betsy-Tacy fans.  Sharla Scannell Whalen has done an impressive amount of research, interviewing people connected to the characters MHL wrote about, reading correspondence, examining old newspapers and county records, and recreating even the floor plans of old houses.<br />Probably no biography could ever answer all of the questions of devoted B-T fans like myself.  Short of a personal interview with Maud Hart Lovelace, nothing could probably satisfy our curiousity.  Whalen's book, in many ways, is less a biography than a corroboration of the Betsy-Tacy books.  In itself, that makes it precious to fans of the series.  I liked knowing something about the characters' counterparts.  Presumably due to the vagaries of historical research, we learn more about some (e.g. Carney/Marney) than others (e.g. Marguerite/Emily).  A few of the episodes most important for understanding Betsy's character and growth (and thus, according to Whalen's well-substantiated argument, Maud's), are not verified - for example, the interlude in Betsy's Wedding when Joe's aunt comes to live with them, prompting Betsy to interrogate her own possessiveness and to expand her ideas of family.<br />I loved this book, but unfortunately I think its appeal will be largely limited to Betsy-Tacy fans and people interested in children's books.  I don't know that it would have been feasible for Whalen to do this, given her interest in documenting the similarities between Betsy's and Maud's lives, but I would have liked to see her set the overlapping stories of their lives in a broader social history context.  How much richer the book would have been if we could have understood Betsy's and Maud's girlhoods against a larger picture of early 20th century adolescence.  How unique was it, for example, that all of Betsy's friends attended high school, and many of them college, in an era when less than 20% ofthe school-aged population graduated from high school?  This suggests important and interesting things about Betsy's/Maud's family and class background, the economy of Deep Valley/Mankato, and the social mores of her Crowd.  This book is so readable that, if it had presented the B-T books not only as a window into Maud Hart Lovelace's life but into the lives of young women of a certain racial, social, and class background in the early 20th century, it could be a huge contribution to the field of women's history.  In short, the book is long on description and documentation; I would have only liked to see more analysis.<br />But there is limited use in bemoaning what a book does not do.  What this book does is pretty tremendous.  It's truly a pleasure to read, and invaluable to anyone who ever wanted to know what happened to Betsy, Tacy, Carney, Tib, Cab, and Tony after the end of the series.	2001-02-23

I was looking forward to a good explanation of using XML with Flash 5. Like all XML users the first thing I did was to verify the XML document in Emberton's project. It would not verify. I found a typo in the DTD, fixed the typo, and then attempted to verify it with the repaired DTD. Still no luck. Next, I went through the ActionScript code, and it seemed to be all right, but no one in their right mind could trust script using unverified XML documents. The explanation of how the process works is unclear, and if anyone thinks that providing a screen shot of the ActionScript with purple comments is an explanation, I can tell you unequivocally that it is not. I passed to the next XML example in the book by John Lenker.<br />Lenker must have held his breath when he prepared this example, hoping against hope that no one who had a clue about XML would read it. First, after a windy and uninformed &quot;discussion&quot; of how XML is formed, the author conveniently forgot to add a DTD section or a schema. Did the XML verify? Of course not! Then the kludge he put together as an &quot;example&quot; was similar to what Chris Smith did in his Flash/XML tutorial available free at Flashkit. However, Chris Smith's XML verified!<br />Lenker used a similar trick as Smith did in setting up his XML, but not quite as good. Instead of using &quot;lastChild&quot; to identify the root node of the XML document (as did Emberton), he used &quot;.firstChild.&quot; That's fine, but to use that code, he had to keep his first two tags on the first line &lt;?xml version...?&gt;&lt;TopStories&gt;. By doing do, he effectively knocks out a tag for the DTD or schema. This is not good advice for people who are writing Flash for clients! It will crash and burn, and you've just made someone who read this kludge look like an idiot.<br />No matter how lofty Lenker makes his pronouncements, he did not do his homework, and anyone who takes his stuff seriously is going to be burned. Go back and read XML: A Primer by St. Laurent (really) to get an idea of what XML is meant to be. I don't know where you're going to find a good explanation of how to use XML with Flash. Try Chris Smith's online tutorial at Flashkit. At least his XML document verifies.and anyone who takes his stuff seriously is going to be burned.

In my opinion, this book is an entirely fitting successor to Chesterton's _Everlasting Man_. With both passion and compassion, Mr. Marshall blends rigorous research with touches of poignantly poetic flair, in a forceful tour of incisive probing into what could be called the 'practical guts' of very many religious traditions. Mr. Marshall is not an ivory tower academic who speculates and hypothesizes on how religions ought to compare; but a mud-on-his-boots social worker who is willing to put his heart and life where his mind leads him.<br />Like many authors before him (including Chesterton and Lewis), Mr. Marshall promotes the idea that the most self-consistently sensible and noble aspects of competitive philosophies and religions (whether instituted before or after Jesus' ministry) not only are fulfilled by Jesus but often cry out (or even implicitly predict) that God would act as traditional Christians say He has in Jesus.<br />This does not mean that Mr. Marshall obscures the differences between religious strands. Nor does it mean that he blindly rejects what they have to say. He lets them speak on their own terms. Nor is he merely shilling for the institution of the 'church', for he often calls the churches to account for failing to measure up to the idea and the Person upon Whom they claim to be founded. But one central thrust to his book (though I don't remember if he says so in so many words) is that parallel failures in other religions and philosophies can be traced to the implications of their foundational roots; while the failures of the Christian churches can be traced, certainly to the root of their fundamental doctrines, but not to the actual doctrines expressed in the Christian scriptures.<br />There are so many clearly articulated principles put into play in this book for truly useful comparison of religions, that I cannot possibly summarize them here. Let me present merely one chapter's topic as an example.<br />Modern sceptics of religion-in-general have said (with admittedly some historical justification) that 'miracles' are what 'we' do, and 'magic' is what 'they' do. Yet it is possible to stand outside the traditions and still identify five important quality-sets by which a useful distinction between 'miracle' and 'magic' could be grounded, whether or not the scholar lends the account of the event any credence as history. Did the original proposers of the event invite verification; or did they propose it in such a way that the event could never even in principle be verified? Did the event, however large or small, fulfill a practical need in a person's life; or did it take place mainly for the sake of 'show'? Did the event enhance the distinctiveness of a person as a person; or did it tend to obliterate the personality? Was the event presented humbly, in such a fashion that the presenter sought to focus attention away from his own glory; or was it presented primarily as an ego-trip self-justification for the glory of the presenter? And did the event come as a request; or did the event come through demand? Rather than merely proposing these distinctions, Mr. Marshall gives numerous tactile examples, drawn from religious traditions both ancient and modern, to help the reader understand the principle behind the distinctions. And he is careful to qualify himself in the process.<br />Indeed, Mr. Marshall always works hard to qualify how far his arguments and proposals can and cannot go. He is entirely willing to grant credit, both logically and ethically, wherever he can. And (most impressively to me) he is willing to face the responsibility of his own shortcomings as a person and put himself in the unflattering position of an example in order to make a point he believes is worth making. On top of all this, I found his arguments to be internally self-consistent, as far as they go.<br />Although I can vouch for the systemic integrity of his work, someone else shall have to vouch for the integrity of the raw data--but for what it is worth, the little bit I _could_ check was on the mark, and he provides numerous quotes and references for cross-checking to ensure he isn't taking remarks out of context. On the other hand, meticulous readers may be slightly annoyed by the higher-than-usual incidence (about once every five pages) of the grammatic-spelling errors which are the hallmark of computer assisted spell-checking. (e.g. the word &quot;on&quot; instead of the word &quot;one&quot;.) None of these few errors, though (and my mere mention of them makes them sound more pervasive than they are), undercuts his arguments or proposals in any way--it is always possible to figure out almost instantly what word should have been printed instead. (More than anything, their existence is mainly a warning to other modern authors: read out loud the final draft of everything you write at least once _after_ the computer has had its way with your manuscript!&lt;g&gt;)<br />Otherwise, I can easily recommend this book with the highest compliment any reader of any stripe can give a work: I wish I had written it myself. Mr. Marshall deserves to be supported as an author (including trenchant criticism where applicable, which he himself invites for further polishing of his argument), and I look forward to the next book (if any) he shall publish.-but for what it is worth, the little bit I _could_ check was on the mark, and he provides numerous quotes and references for cross-checking to ensure he isn't taking remarks out of context.

I of course had to read this one next. This one includes the press kit, the pre-mission report, the post-launch mission operation report, the mission debrief, and several of the official reports on the accident, including the internal one and the one submitted to Congress. The pre-mission information is interesting but is obviously made obsolete by the loss of the service module during the mission. More interesting are the accident reports and the mission debrief, particularly the latter, which gives the astronauts' perspective on the whole thing and how they managed to get through it. What I found most interesting was tying in my reading of this with remembering how it was depicted in the movie Apollo 13--it turns out the movie is remarkably accurate and includes a lot of little truthful touches that are verified in this book!<br />I've only looked briefly at the CD-ROM, but there are additional worthwhile goodies on there (and accessible from a Macintosh despite what it says). My only criticism right now is that there are literally hundreds of photographs taken during the mission without any organization to speak of: if you want to find, for example, the photos of the service module showing the damage, you're just going to have to search through the collection with the only clue being that the photos are in roughly chronological order.<br />So if you're a total space-aholic like me, you'll find this book fascinating. Others, less devoted, might still find some items of interest here but might be better off reading an appropriate narrative history like Andrew Chaikin's A Man on the Moon or Lost Moon by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.	2001-02-15

Books	1	4	16	N	N	matlock again has no case for his claims	This book cannot be taken seriously.  Matlock claims that all religions, and especially Judaism, derive from early 'objectivist' Hinduism ('Yishvara'), which he regards as a nature religion involving reincarnation and seven basic rules of conduct.  To this end he revises the history of Hinduism and other religions and makes highly dubious claims about the mindsets of modern believers.  He regards most current forms of Hinduism as 'Aryanist' and 'subjectivist' distortions.  In some passages he actually proclaims that all people - even professed atheists - are automatically 'members' of Yishvara.<br />Matlock supports his basic claims by uncritically citing a mixture of ancient pseudo-historical and religious texts (read literally or metaphorically, as it suits him) and recent fringe Indian or pro-Hindu thinkers.  In many cases he simply makes unsupported assertions.<br />A prominent feature of the book involves 18th-Century-style philology, often relying on very loose similarities indeed.  Matlock tries to argue that many words in a range of languages come from Sanskrit or Kashmiri (he thinks that Kashmir had important early contact with Judaism), that everyone once spoke Sanskrit, that the Munda languages of India are an important source for German, etc, etc.  But most of his alleged cognates - invented by him or taken from unreliable Indian sources - are ludicrously wrong or (where less is known about the etymology) very implausible.<br />On non-linguistic fronts, Matlock develops a complex quasi-occult philosophy based on Hindu notions extended to cover St Patrick's Ireland, Old Testament Israel and the contemporary USA.  He also gives an idiosyncratic account of the relation between faith (good) and belief (bad) - although he admits that he himself does not follow this in his book.  He identifies his own approach as 'scientific' and 'empirical', and redefines the notions of science and rationality so as to exclude skepticism which rejects the paranormal.  His own canon of empiricism involves nothing stronger than the agreement of more than 'a few' witnesses, and often only his own subjective or unverified experiences and impressions.  Matlock makes various attempts to appear intellectually respectable, eg by criticising 'Outer Space cultists', but his own use of evidence/argumentation is no better than that of von Daniken and such, and he even accepts Atlantis as real.<br />I cannot recommend that readers buy this book.  It will only annoy the well-informed and confuse newcomers to the field.is own canon of empiricism involves nothing stronger than the agreement of more than 'a few' witnesses, and often only his own subjective or unverified experiences and impressions.

While the inferences made were coherent within the structure of Ridley's thought, the author left out an enormous amount of details and counter-examples which first year college students studying evolution would know.  For example, Gould and Lewontin often comment that biological structures are not necessarily the result of adaptive changes, particularly on the genetic level.  Instead, they may be secondary outcomes of additional adaptations.  The study of human sexuality as well as evolutionary biology simply has not advanced to the stage where a scientist can accurately state which gene or genes lead to certain sexual behaviors, why a biological explanation trumps cultural explanations for gender roles, and why Ridley's extremely diverse and yet shallow argument sheds any new and more importantly scientifically verified light on the subject of human sexuality.<br />As a work of science or social science, Ridley's book is severely flawed.  Numerous examples which he uses to support his argument contain no citations and gloss over large sociological, political, and biological debates.  As an example, he cites a Northwestern Pacific Indian tribe and their remarkable ability to shift their marital structure based on economic conditions.  Yet, his citation does not refer to any study where this material is presented.  Instead, it is merely used to support his final epistemological claim.<br />Ridley's argument is entertaining, but filled with fictions.  As an introduction to evolutionary psychology, you will not find a better one.  Unfortunately, the book is also indicative of the weaknesses of the field, and the enormous distance it must go if it is to present a convincing argument concerning human nature.	2001-02-13

Ayer was a second rate thinker not worthy of serious consideration. Unfortunately, many do not agree with my assessment of Ayer's ideas and his ill earned fame and influence persists even in this century. One may prefer to ignore Ayer, but pragmatically this is not wise. Ben Roger's splendid book does much to assist us to learn more about Ayer and those who worship the ground he walked on. Ayer is a quintessential example of how a highly rewarding career can be built upon deliberate iconoclasm and trendiness. Pseudo intellectualism is often warmly received by the Left leaning members of Great Britain's university milieu. In such a dilettante environment, one's ability to shock and entertain is valued far more than true intellectual brilliance. The author spends significant time dealing with Ayer's relationships with members of England's upper crust. This class of people psychologically eviscerated by self doubts and low self esteem are perfect cannon fodder for Ayer's pernicious charm.<br />Ayer gravitated towards a personal philosophy that served to rationalize away his faults and mistreatment of other human beings. The central premise of Ayer's so called philosophy (which is actually an anti-philosophy) is that only phenomena that can be ascertained within the severely limited parameters of Logical Positivism merit our attention. Thus, nothing is worthy of valid interest that cannot be empirically verified. Questions concerning love, God, values, evil, the possibility of life after death, are to be relegated to the dust bin of history. The very underpinnings of a viable social order are inevitably threatened by the tacit conclusion of Ayer's thoughts. Ayer was a charlatan who seduced his adoring faithful into embracing a way of looking at matters that legitimately belong to the realm of the hard sciences. Unfortunately, this approach fails miserably when addressing the unavoidable existential issues of human life.<br />I suspect that I'm encouraging people to read Ben Roger's book for reasons that will not entirely thrill the author. Roger almost certainly doesn't share my caustic appraisal of Ayer. That, however, is Roger's problem and not mine. We should read Roger's book to learn from the past so not to fall prey to similar nonsense in the future. Karl Popper, an ardent foe of Ayer's central beliefs deserves your rapt devotion. Popper is truly a giant for all time, and scathingly took Ayer and his ilk to  task.

Besides, the 'Turkish Holocaust Museum' speaks for itself. The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination of Muslim population in Russian Armenia, Karabag, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Algeria and Kosova is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the extermination of millions of Muslims by the Armenian Government during WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during WWII. The Turkish Holocaust is a historical fact. We learned a little bit about the Jewish Holocaust, but this period of history was obviously not stressed  even though the Armenian genocide of the Muslim and Jewish people is part of the curriculum now. Upon the successful conclusion of the Armenian genocide of the Muslim and Sephardic Jewish people, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Refik visited Trabzon, Kars, Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the Turkish Holocaust. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian barbarism, but also reveal their goal and true nature. <br />As Prof McCarthy has abundantly demonstrated in several chapters of his great work, it is important to note that the Armenians have never denied the Armenian crime of genocide inflicted upon millions of Muslim people between 1914 and 1920. &quot;I killed Muslims by every means possible. Yet it is sometimes a pity to waste bullets for this...&quot;[A. Lalayan, 'Revolutsionniy Vostok (Revolutionary East)', No: 2-3, Moscow, 1936.] Also, the memoirs of an Armenian officer, 'Ohanus Appressian,' who participated in the Armenian genocide of the Muslim and Jewish people between 1914 and 1920 amply details the total annihilation of the entire Turkish population of the Russian Armenia. ['Men Are Like That' by Leonard Ramsden Hartill. The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis (1926). See page 202.]<br/>I wish to congratulate the most prolific and accurate historian of our time on his relentless efforts for documenting the Turkish Holocaust.	2001-02-08

His arguments and examples especially from his own field, i.e. chemistry, are often not too easy to understand let alone to be verified. But the book lacks any kind of obscurantism. The difficulties might stem from the actual thesis of the book itself: Knowledge is not gained by an objective flow of events and therefore the necessary outcome of a determined scientific endeavour, but it's grounded in so human conditions as the sense of beauty and passion.  There's always a foreshadowing of the kind of enterprise and even of probable results that make scientists follow some line of argument or experiment and letting the other, so Polanyi's thesis. The decision therefore is not guided by any objective and given fact, but mainly lies in the realm of the scholar's interest, which gains a sense of reality, yet. I'm not sure, whether Polanyi would be pleased by that, but certainly he stands in the tradition of Kant and Wittgenstein, who in their respective develepment of a theory of knowledge point to the fact, that it's always human condition that shapes knowledge. There's no such thing as the being itself but always being as perceived through our senses (Kant) or language (Wittgenstein). In a time, where in the so-called life- sciences the human being is in danger of being reduced to his/ her genes and by that to the raw material of any kind of possible experiments, the voice of Polanyi should be heard, because the refutation of objectivism gets into the heart of the matter.	2001-02-04

His motivation was to get the truth RIGHT about SOG's History, the men who volunteered and fought against all odds. One of his rules when he was compiling this four volume set was that if a story came along i.e. &quot;There I was with so &amp; so, knee deep in the mud, my CAR-15 blazing away&quot; he would not put the story in unless in was verified by two or three other independent sources. Here you have a man who volunteered for SOG &amp; CCN numerous times over a number of years, fought and drank with some of SOG's legends such as &quot;Mad Dog Shriver&quot;.  In other words he was there and had a vested interest in doing a number one job in documenting what he and his fellow soldiers did.  You will find that the stories are descriptive, sad and funny and if you knew Harve Saal he had a great wit.

Some features like dams, diversions and rapids don't exist where they are depicted yet some features are more hazardous that indicated. Use caution and don't accept at face value. It should be verified through some other source before depending on it. (Fish &amp; Game, canoe dealers, local paddlers, other guide books, etc.) Originally published in 1993, some of the information is now dated.   The author has provided a great quantity of useful facts for floaters and fishermen and the appendices are also chockful of valuable information. I think the out-of-state visitor will find a lot of this especially helpful.<br />Hydrographs are always interesting and a worthwhile addition to any river guide. However, Mr. Thompson, for some reason, used just 1991 flows for many of the rivers. This has skewed the information because, in some areas of the state, 1991 was an exceptionally good snowpack year and produces a hydrograph much higher than an average would be. <br />His overuse of quotation marks to deliniate the river miles is quite disconcerting. The glossary, called &quot;River Talk&quot;, has included some definitions a paddler would probably never use but other, important terms have been omitted.<br />To summarize--this book does have helpful info but do use caution because there are errors.	2001-01-26

This is a wondeful book.  It is the story of a charming young man, Joshua, who comes to Corvallis, Oregon and manages to start a religious cult, populated mostly by young women.  The story is told from the point of view of a 16 year old girl, Eva Mae Hurt, a real person who lived there and then.  Her family was very involved with Joshua.  Most of the information was culled from newspaper reports from the time, but (apparently), the Holy Rollers are local lore;  Crew said she has always known about them.  Crew imbues Eva Mae with a vivid personality and thoughts, and, although none of them can be verified, they make sense given the age and situation.  This book inspired me to read all of Crew's other books, which I enjoyed.  Although all but one are written for Young Adults, some adults will enjoy them.  In the case of &quot;Brides of Eden,&quot; it definitely will appeal to both young adults and adults.

The stories - mostly verified true - permit only the briefest of remorse toward the parties in question before laughter takes hold.  It is truly hard to feel sorry for someone who wanted a free cola so bad that he would not let go of the can even when the machine toppled over and crushed him.

He finds a compelling story, researches it exhaustively, and then shares his excitement.   The history of Internet cryptography is a perfect subject for Levy, who delights in recounting stories about technoradicals with new ideas who see them through to fruition.<br />Encryption truly is one of the most critical technologies necessary for a smoothly functioning virtual world, and is very much the case that the U.S. Federal Government successfully delayed the general availability of strong encryption for at least a decade.  (Future economists may point back to the last two decades of the 20th century and show how this failed government policy was responsible for the loss of U.S. dominance in the high-tech market.)<br />It would have been easy to take the politically correct road and portray the Feds as being evil conspirators, bent on maintaining their own power and pride at the expense of the entire world.  Levy chooses a more balanced approach, depicting the NSA in nearly heroic terms.  He is especially sympathetic towards Clint Brooks (a name I did not know), an NSA lifer who developed the key escrow concept as a compromise that would allow widespread public utilization of strong encryption while still allowing law enforcement (and of course, intelligence agencies), the ability to intercept communications under controlled circumstances.  If both the NSA and their philosophical opponents are heroes with noble goals, a tragic ending is inevitable, which adds an element of pathos to this triumph of democracy.<br />As a former software vendor, I've been totally frustrated by both the crypto export laws and by the NSA attitude of \\"If you only knew what we knew, you wouldn't even ask that question.\\"  That argument turned out to be just as specious now as everyone thought it was at the time, but the marvelous aspect of this book is that Levy is able to make a cynic like me accept that the people within the Puzzle Palace have legitimate motivations.  (He is much harsher on the FBI, and creates an especially unflattering portrayal of Louie Freeh).  It's a well-balanced approach to a very contentious subject, which adds considerably to the author's credibility.<br />Personalities loom large in a history like this one, and Levy is a master at drawing them out of their personal shells and detailing aspects of their private lives to explain their motivations and feelings.   Whitfield Diffie is the old master who had the vision to conceive of a new model for encryption that would meet the unprecedented needs of a network society.  Ron Rivest was the energy behind the development of the most significant public key algorithm, created by an unlikely trio of inventors. Jim Bidzos was a young playboy who found the commercialization of the RSA technology to be the challenge he needed in his hitherto shallow life of world travel, hot cars and fast women.  Like Diffie, Phil Zimmerman marches to a drummer that only he can hear, yet this amateur programmer succeeded in popularizing strong encryption long before RSA and its millions in venture cap money did.  Given his ten years of personal research and interviews of the people he chronicles, Levy's will probably be the definitive written account on many of these quirky visionaries.<br />The book is a quick read, but a good one.   Technically, it is very accurate, with one unfortunate mistake on page 178 where it reads \\"Then he uses the hash function to recreate Alice's message from the digest...\\"  Hash functions are 1-way functions, and cannot be reversed.  If it read instead, \\"Then he uses the hash function to recreate Alice's message digest...\\" it would be more accurate.  In order to verify a digital signature, the encrypted hash value provided by the sender is decrypted by their public key, which is then compared to another hash value generated by the verifying party (see p. 38 of \\"Applied Cryptography, 2nd Edition\\" by Bruce Schneier).  Other than this confusion over how digital signatures are verified, the book does an excellent job of presenting the concepts of public key encryption to a non-technical reader.  Besides being an enjoyable tale of business and technology history, this book could also be considered an executive-level introduction to the need for encryption on the Internet and the ways in which modern implementations provide it.  <br />If you want to know what is happening when that little lock icon at the bottom of your web browser closes, you'll find a conceptual answer in this book.  You'll not only learn the sequence of events that led to the development of SSL, but you'll also read the history of the first successful attempt to crack SSL security, and its significance to you as a customer of sites like Amazon.  \\"Crypto\\" should appeal not only to those who are interested in the history of technology, but anyone wanting to understand more about the history and personal and commercial use of encryption on the Internet.  Anyone involved in an e-commerce project or with an interest in information security would find this an interesting and accessible book.   It is not a technology book per se, but I think most technically-oriented people will enjoy reading about how people like them had the drive and vision to change the world-especially when the odds were so heavily stacked against them.  <br />This is a compelling and important story that needs to be told and understood.  Levy is neither the first to undertake this telling, and undoubtedly won't be the last, but I'm convinced that this will become a classic of technology history-even more so than his earlier books.  His thoroughness, extensive research, and evenhanded approach will make this book an important source for future researchers.	2001-01-21

Our age is most fortunate, in that the conjectural association of Mythologies with scientific evidence is no longer considered heretical. Archaeology, for example, which used to be a matter of frantic digging to expose, catalogue and museum artifacts of ancient civilizations, has made enormous strides since abandoning the principle of avoiding controversial views that ran counter to 'acceptable' documentation. Hopefully, education here in the USA, and in other parts of the World, will follow suit, and become informative instead of following social guidelines established in less enlightened times by close-minded thinking.<br />Angiras, as a Scientist, provides a lucid and entirely valid argument for an alternative theory of how the Solar System organized itself comparatively recently, contrary to popular belief. Two things strike me as remarkable in the context of his argument: - Sumerian Mythology relates the events in an allegorical fashion, which Angiras explains scientifically. Recent research into origins of 'current' humanity indicates that Dravidians, migrating from Sind [around the valley of the Indus in north-western India] took their culture, Earth-based religion, and corresponding Mythology into Sumeria and neighboring areas. These people were ancient enough to have observed at least after-effects of the propositions made by the Author, - In recent months, Geologists, examining close-up pictures of the Martian surface, have concluded that many features of the landscape can only have been formed by the flowing of vast quantities of water.<br />Read this book with an open mind, even if you think you may not agree with the theories that are posited therein, while keeping in mind that the aforementioned Dravidian people, in 4000 BCE, knew that the Earth rotated around the Sun [not a popular belief in later times!!]. And pay careful attention to seemingly anomalous discoveries that are consistently emerging as we get closer to our World, and its immediate neigbors.<br />Reading this book [and the prior publication by the same Author] is not only great entertainment, but also provides vast insight into how much of a skeptic you actually are!	2001-01-18

However, without a detailed indication of the author's sources and how he checked and verified the information, it remains just a story, rather then the fact it purports to be.  Written in the novel style apparent in Dead Men Walking (the similarities with which suggest it was ghosted by Nicholas Davies), Ten-Thirty-Three puts, often facile, words in the mouths of the characters without any way of knowing whether they are recollections, supposition or merely fantasy.  The brief author's introductory note states that the sources were former members of the security services.  No details are, however, of the High Court injunction brought against its publication, nor of any other sources used.  The lack of an index compounds the feeling that there is little verifiable in the material.  <br />Apparent discrepancies are common.  For example, we are not given any explanation why a UVF man was involved in a UDA attack.  Similarly although the murder of Ian Catney was claimed by the UVF, the author goes on to say other murders were planned by the UDA and Brian Nelson, as if the two were the same.  Unsubstantiated comments abound such as \\"there could only have been one reason why McKee was murdered and that was because he was a Catholic\\", when presumably there could be many reasons, although none are discussed or discounted.  The key most controversial assertion that Margaret Thatcher was completely aware of and sanctioned organised, regular State murders is based on the \\"fact\\" that there was a reporting line of committees to one she chaired.  This is unconvincing and insufficient for such an important and crucial claim.  In the end, this book, while interesting, and showing some flashes of insight, can only be viewed a good story without much more detail and evidence.  As such it compares very badly with the meticulous work of authors such as Martin Dillon and Peter Taylor.            <br />While it is still possible that any or allof the assertions in the book could be true, what is certain is that it offers little or nothing in the way of proof, or even convincing argument that this is the case.  Conclusion: case not proven, file under fiction.	2001-01-13

I wish I had this material available to me years ago, so that I was better prepared for the leadership challenges I would face as an officer in the US Army.  I have read many leadership books the past decade in order to better develop my own skills, but none of them has put together all the pieces like John Maxwell does in this book.<br />Basically, the book covers Maxwell's 21 laws of leadership.  Each chapter describes the law in detail, and provides many historical examples to help reinforce the principle.  I think that he has done a great job of taking a lot of material and focusing in on the key points that help make a leader successful.  The book's structure also allows you to put the book down for a few days, and not lose your focus or understanding when you get a chance to return to it.  I particularly liked this approach since I never seem to have enough time for professional reading these days.  Lastly, the material is easy to understand and apply to any leadership situation, which makes it a great resource for those leaders looking for a way to have an immediate impact on their organization.<br />As a military officer, I understand the principle role that leadership plays in an organization's success. During my short career (10 years), I have been in both great and lousy units.  Each time, I can trace the unit's performance directly to its leader and his/her ability to influence its members to accomplish the mission and take care of its people.  My personal experience only helped reinforce the material, and verified in my mind that John Maxwell is &quot;on-target&quot; with his laws.<br />I highly recommend this book for any leader.  Whether you are just starting out on your career, or have been in a leadership position for years, I think this book can make an impact on your performance.	2001-01-11

This is a practical and sensitive book, and easy to read in a few hours.  <br />As a father of five unmarried daughters, I am buying a copy for each of them.  While the book approaches the topic of touching between the unmarried couples from an Orthodox Jewish perspective, the book is after all about shomer negiah. The basic principle is real and true, whether you view life from a religious perspective or a secular viewpoint. And the basic principle is this -- whether you are Jewish, secular, or Christian -- that men and women who are not relatives should be extremely cautious about expressing affection for one another through touch. This is not prudishness, it is solid practical advice that goes to heart of the human nature. <br />Our current secular culture, of course, has led most of us to buy into a different approach which even justifies couples living together before marriage, or dating practices that lay the foundation for irresponsible no-fault behavior, particularly on the part of men, which then can lead to no-fault divorces and much pain for both men and women.  This book approaches the issue head on by showing that an ancient approach to a current obsession has much wisdom for us today.  Actually, I am not doing justice to the book.  The author does a fantastic job in every respect, with much humor and plenty of real life examples.  The author is also the mother of seven children, a Yale graduate, and an Orthodox Jew living in Jerusalem.<br />Granted, by today's standards, the author is being very radical. But today's standards have failed for all pratical purposes. I keep using the word &quot;practical&quot; because, in my opinion, the author is very down to earth, and everything that is printed on the book cover, &quot;funny, entertaining and enlightening,&quot; is verified in the reading.<br />One last thing.  Men should read this book in particular because there is so much about the female nature that we are totally uninformed about.  If you have daughters, you can't go wrong with this book, because you naturally want to know how to educate your daughter for the best, and for success. She may think you are crazy and old fashioned, but, as a woman, she will not be able to resist the truth that this book contains. At least that's the hope I have for my daughters.	2001-01-08

For example he gives no references for his nutritive value charts, making them useless. Most of his assertions are unreferenced, so they are useless. He states one list is &quot;accurate and usable&quot; but it gives two glycemic indexes for lentils: 30-39% and 20-29%, so you can take your pick. Walford lists the virtues of liver but fails to point out that it is extremely high in cholesterol and arachidonic acid. He says most grains have a low glycemic index - which is nonsense. Walford compares almonds by the &quot;teaspoon&quot; with cashews by &quot;14 large&quot; which is useless. Perhaps his most surprising omission is to ignore the evidence that the nutrient content of food varies enormously depending on its source. However Walford openly admits that his advice is &quot;not competely verified&quot;, and much of his evidence results from work on rats. Perhaps this is why I smell a rat.	2001-01-08

Barbour understands this and takes mostly successful pains to help us along.  And just as the body feels invigorated and stronger after a good workout, so does the mind on finishing Barbour's book.<br />The central thesis is that the role played by time in physicists' descriptions of the world,  has to go.  Its departure will open the way to unifying the hitherto unbridgeable gap between classical physics and quantum physics.  As Barbour explains with fascinating clarity, both are obviously correct and verified descriptions of how things work; they just don't mesh!  This, for physicists who believe deeply in the unity of nature, is cause for deep frustration.<br />Any book that sets out to address the big questions about `the ultimate arena of the universe' is not without ambition.  That is what led me forward through some tough going early on because, hey,  if this guy is really about to advance a description of how the universe works, I want to hear it!  Well, he delivers.  For Barbour, time, or rather the experience of change and movement, which require time to be real, is an illusion created by the existence of an infinity of possible simultaneously-existing and unchanging  `nows'.  These nows are configurations of the complete universe in a multi-dimensional configuration-space.  Quantum-probabilistic laws govern which nows are experienced, and all the laws of physics can be re-cast in terms of this version of how the universe works.<br />Put your reservations aside and consider the argument.  It's persuasive.  After all, our experience of history is only through records and memories, which of course are part of any now we experience.  After all, we don't truly look `into the past'.  We simply look at records and memories available to us at this instant, and in Barbour's thesis these indeed can reflect other nows, which are other places in the universe, but not other times.  The corollary of this is that nothing moves, nothing changes, in this model of the universe.  We don't travel from one now to the next and experience life like watching a movie made up of multiple still snapshots.  We just are.  The rest is illusion.<br />This last is where things don't quite work for this reader.  What we are seeing is a heroic attempt to reconcile the way this thesis works as a piece of theoretical physics, with a macro-description of the facts of existence and human experience.  Like other such attempts one encounters in this neighborhood of ideas, it hits the shoals of philosophy, not of science.  Here's what I mean: movement and change are facts of existence.  The role of science is to understand their nature, but it is not the role of science (nor philosophy) to deny that they exist.  That's out of bounds.  To put it another way: if you assert that movement and change as we experience them are illusory, what you have done is to redefine the meaning of the word `illusory' in a somewhat arbitrary way.  Again, out of bounds. And it may just be that Barbour's physics is right, just his attempt to bring it back to a correspondence with our daily realities that is flawed. <br />So give this one a shot and stretch your mind!	2001-01-03

In Dr. Clark's latest publication on hiv she has presented a little &quot;experiment&quot; that can be &quot;verified.&quot; See what you think of her latest &quot;Biochemistry Lab Manual.&quot;(copyright 2000.)<br />Dr. Clark states that snails are the actual host of the pathogen that secretes the hiv virus. It is the Fasiolopsis buskii. She has found that you can culture this virus in an aquarium simply by feeding the snail(and its hiv secreting fluke) with any fish food that is contaminated with benzene. Benzenes affect on our immune system(and the flukes as well) is swift and debilitating. It allows a molecular peptide called &quot;hiss-siss&quot;(abbreviated name) to dissapear. This peptide prevents viral integration and disintegration with our genes. Benzene also wipes out our &quot;ack-muramyl&quot; peptide. This prevents viral replication. So basically benzene prevents these 2 peptides from existing and in turn allows viruses to multiply and visit our genes. In the fluke parasite(on the snails) the multiplying and visiting virus happens to be hiv(actually the live protein 24 strand antigen.) This active &quot;p24 antigen&quot;(live hiv) can be verified by modern day ELISA immunology testing. So basically, grab an aquarium, some snails, benzene polluted fish food or corn meal and culture your own hiv! <br />So why all the hype. Well in 1963 the drug company Burrows/Welcome(now Glaxo/Welcome) designed a cancer chemo-therapy drug. It was the most expensive investment of its time. Unfortunately it was extremely toxic to the immune system and was discontinued. It was basically a death sentence.  So how does one get rid of this drug after shelving it all this time. Manufacture a monkey scam and bingo! Hiv, the killer human virus. Dr. Clarks book will inform you of the coincidences and the puzzle will become much clearer! What was the name of this deathly cancer drug turned miracle aids treatment? AZT.	2001-01-02

The subject matter of 'The Spear Of Destiny' is fascinating and the style is compelling. For the first couple of chapters, I thought that - despite the sensationalistic nature of the writing - there possibly may have been some truth to Trevor Ravenscroft's assertions.<br />In short, the author uses this book to present the beliefs and opinions of Dr. Walter Johannes Stein - who during WWII provided information to Winston Churchill about the supposedly occultic personalities of Hitler and other Nazi leaders - although it is difficult to discern what portion of the book is based on Dr. Stein's somewhat dubious recollections, and what is subjective speculation on the part of Ravenscroft. <br />One problem came for me, when I noticed that many of the more grandiose statements in the book are not referenced at all, and thus the reader has no way of verifying the authenticity of the author's claims. There are footnotes, albeit rather minimalistic, but these are mostly relating to quotes that can be easily verified or found readily in other common publications. It is also true to say that these (referenced) quotes do not for the most part help to further the cause of the book to anywhere near the degree that the unsubstantiated quotes might do, would in fact they be traceable to a reliable source. In addition to this, much of the evidence given in the book is drawn from the psychic visons of Rudolf Steiner and General Helmuth von Moltke.<br />Up until chapter five, the story seems almost plausible and is without a doubt a most compelling read for anyone who has an interest in the Spear Of Longinus, Nazi Germany, or the occult in general. However, by the end of chapter five, the book is becoming clearly predictable and filled with clichés; not to mention the fact that there are some obvious historical errors, such as Ravenscroft's claim that Hitler celebrated his thirty-third birthday in 1921 (page 113). The author also takes many unsubstantiated myths - such as Hitler having only one testicle (pages 172, 173)  - to be proven fact. 'The Spear Of Destiny' also contains several quotes taken from Hermann Rauschning's 'Hitler Speaks', which according to acclaimed Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw, is &quot;a work now regarded to have so little authenticity that it is best to disregard it altogether.&quot; (Taken from Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris)<br />Whilst Ravenscroft does not proclaim himself to be a christian, the reader gets the feeling that he certainly sympathises strongly with christian morals, and although the non-xian belief of reincarnation is central to the story, he always manages to tie this facet back into christianity or christian politics. One of the most frustrating aspects of this book is the author's tendency to portray all the supposed 'good guys' in the story as being the reincarnations of other 'good guys', and all the allegedly 'bad' characters as having been 'bad guys' in a former life. The fact that the plot of the story hinges around this detail certainly doesn't help to add to the credibility of the book.<br />For what it's worth, 'The Spear Of Destiny' is a good yarn and definetely quite provocatively written, but in my opinion, this is the extent of it's value. Historically speaking, the book is poorly researched and there are no where near enough references to substantiate the author's extravagant claims.	2000-12-29

Yes, it has some inaccuracies (especially on the included CD-ROM tests - at the end of my test preparation I had to stop using them so the few wrong answers there were would no longer stick in my memory), and there are some areas where the book could have gone into greater depth, but for the money this book is a good buy.  I would recommend to the publisher that a second edition with a better content review process is in order (the errata posted on their web site could use some more work as well), but you get what you expect from a dummies book, a relatively light-hearted treatment of an often dry subject.  The cartoons alone are worth taking a look at this book.  Many of the sample questions from the book are accurate reflections of the questions I saw on my test.<br />Since the current passing score for the Network+ exam is 82% and the test fee for non-CompTIA members will soon be raised to $190, I would strongly recommend that you also read the Network+ Exam Prep and Cram books, plus check out some of the Network+ Certification resources available on the web.  Be very careful to check out the conflicting information you will find (there are problems in all of the books I read and much more junk can be found in the web info).  I only missed one question on my Network+ exam, so I can tell you from experience that there are a lot of problems out there.  Just do your best to find verified accurate answers to the conflicting issues, and you should be fine.  In fact, the only question I missed on the exam was the direct result from an answer I trusted from yet another Network+ book's sample exam that turned out not to be correct!  If you are in doubt, check those sample question's answers with as many trusted resources as you can find.<br />In short, this book can be a good first study aid, or a good last review (I did both), but if you want to pass the Network+ exam with room to spare, make certain you go further in your preparation.	2000-12-27

Told with naturalistic detail and through rough-hewn soldier dialogue, Andrew Huebner's horrific portrait of the final episodes of our nation's genocidal actions against its indigenous peoples will repel many readers searching for something redemptive about this calculated slaughter.  The novel's three protagonists, one of whom, incidentally, is the author's great-great grandfather, follow similar moral paths.  Their early naivete stripped by observation and repulsive participation in the butchering of defenseless Indians, the three undergo a metamorphosis of sorts, ultimately resulting in conscience/empathy which alterately manifests as compassion, identification, and/or madness.<br />Blood courses in this angry and reproachful book.  Unlike the cleansing effect abolitionist John Brown predicted and Abraham Lincoln verified as national pennance for the sin of slavery, the blood shed by Indians has no spiritual value; this racist murder is moraly indefensible and outrageous.  United States soldiers summarily execute defenseless women and children, and attribute (with remarkable psychological projection) savagery to the very victims of our own cruelty and amorality.  Co-existence simply is not an option.  Removal  --  extermination  --  is the process by which a white culture validates its own manifest destiny.<br />To read this novel and to absorb its overwhelming condemnation of our past will require resolve.  But, make no mistake, Huebner's novel reminds us that real people, not some faceless policy-makers, did the killing.  Our land, soaked with shame, is truly American by Blood.	2000-12-27

I learned a lot of information from the book--like details on the virus--it actually made me conscious of every bit of spit I swallowed and the like! I, however, have some criticism.  I don't altogether understand why there was so much detail.  In some areas, I just wanted to get past all the &quot;circular&quot; stuff and get down to what I knew was coming next! Also, has it been scientifially verified that AIDS originated in Africa? Has a book been written in such detail as has the Hot Zone, tracing the probable or actual discovery and development of the disease? In other words, does anyone really know for sure that this was the source or have there been other theories yet to be proven or disproven? So it's a knowledgable book that I would probably recommend (PG-13 for language, I'm sure!).  I'm not sure all the &quot;terminology&quot; was necessary, but perhaps I'm just an island in a sea of readers that feels that way!

For instance, Christians or Non Christians do not understand sometimes God's overall plan; such as there is Holy Fire, remember Moses burning bush and there is evil fire, remember hell?  Another example is in the book of Acts God speaks of Holy Tongues/languages; however there is also an unholy tounges and occult people use it.  <br />Regarding this subject of out of the body experiences, God's people can have them or Satan's people can have them.  Example of God's people having an out of the body experience is Enoch, Enoch was taken to heaven numerous times and also Paul.  You can rest assured Satan's people who have reached a certain level with him are also experiencing these OBE's.<br />On another subject, hell is real.  It is in the center of the earth the bible says.  The bible also says that with two or three witnesses a thing is established.  Mary K. Baxter's book is perfectly lined up with the bible.  But another witness who was taken to hell under different circumstances has verified the contents of Mary K. Baxter's book.  Her name is Aline Baxley, and you can aquire a tract discribing the event from this ministry: Life Purpose Ministries, P.O. Box 990220, Redding, CA 96099.  <br />Furthermore, it appears that some non christians and christians have a difficult time believing the bible regarding the wrath of God.  Just read the old testimant and you'll see a lot of judgement and wrath of God.  God has a loving side and God has a judgement/wrath side.  <br />Many people have no problem beliving Satan doing the things he is doing on this earth, however God is doing powerfull things also, even in areas you may not want to deal with or accept.  <br />For instance, in 1989 in Finland the scientists were drilling a hole in the crust of the earth, they let down into the hole super-sensitive microphones a number of miles into the earth.  Doctor Azzacov, the manager of the project, gave a statement to the &quot;Ammenusastia&quot; Newspaper in Finland stating that they heard human voices, screaming in pain, perhaps millions, in the background, of suffering souls screaming. After this ghastly discovery, about half of the scientists quit because of fear.  He stated, hopefully that which is down there will stay there.

An occultation occurs when the Moon or a planet passes in front of a more distant object. Unfortunately there is very considerable doubt that the occultation ever took place.  One of Molnar's supporters,who has decided to remain anonymous, has said that it does not matter if the occultation ever took place, a close encounter is good enough.  However, such close encounters are very frequent, and they would not have attracted the attention of astrologers.  Also an important part of Molnar's book and a central thesis of his theory is that occultations were important to ancient astrologers, so a mere close encounter, called a conjunction will really not do, they occur a few times in every year.  The facts of the matter are that we cannot be certain that an occultation took place in 6 BC, we cannot be certain that it took place in the constellation of Aries or that it was visible in the part of the world associated with Christ's birth.  A few astronomers and several astrologers in the USA supported the claim made by Molnar.  I do believe that they were convinced by his verbal arguments and that they did not check out the astronomical details and mathematical uncertainties involved in using modern computer programs to calculate past events involving the moon. In August 2000 I atttended the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, in Manchester,UK.  One paper presented here was on ancient solar eclipses (an eclipse is an occultation of Sun by Moon), which showed that if one used modern software to calculate past eclipses then the times were always different from the recorded times.  This is because of the vagaries in the Earth's rotation rate.  Over the past two thousand years the day length has changed, but unfortunately not at a constant rate. Comparing the recorded times with the calculated times does give an averate rate of change, by there are errorsinherent in the average, and it is not possible to take into account sudden and unexpected glitches in the spin rate, which have also been detected in the historical records.  Molnar's occultation remains a computer simulate event, subject to uncertainty. It is a pity that he did not make the uncertainties clear in his book. The spin rate of Earth gets no mention.  I first came across Molnar's work in an article he wrote for the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society (June 1995), where he claimed; &quot;..the second occultation could only have been detected through the mathematics of the astologers.&quot;  In my book THE BIRTH OF CHRIST (VIRGIN 1998), I comment on this claim, by pointing out that because of the considerable complexity of lunar motion, the astronomy of the Magi-astrologers was not up to the task. I was pleased to see that in his book he chad changed his mind about the mathematical ability of the astrologers of old.  He was now saying that they could have predicted the possibility of an occultation. Molnar seems to imply in his book that he is the first person to recognise the fact that THE STAR should be seen in astrological terms.  This is not the case; Johann Kepler (1571-1630), a very famous astronomer who practice astrology set us on this path, and in recent years Prof. F K d'Occhieppo, Dr David Hughes and Dr E L Martin have continued along this path.  The book is misleading in another respect.  It implies that there was concensus among astrologers as to how to interpret horoscopes.  No such concensus existed in the ancient world, just as no concensus exists today.  Astrology was just beginning to emerge from the older style cosmic belief systems, and Hipparchus (190-120 BC) had only just discovered the phenomenon of precession, which caused the point of the vernal equinox to move out of Aries - The Ram into Pisces - the Fishes, about 100 years before the birth of Christ.  Serious astrologers of the time were just beginning to come to terms with this.  Molnar chose a very narow thread through this minefield of ancient astrology to produce a set of arguments that supported his thesis of an occultation which cannot be verified mathematically with any degree of certainty.	2000-12-20

I read the book with the anticipation that it would present new and authentic information having a scientific and verifiable background. I found the book to be largely erroneous based on all standards of nutrition that have a scientific basis verified by population studies, university research or clinical methods that I am familiar with. In my view, statements are made in the book which would not be acceptable in a freshman biology paper. As an example, a bedrock assumption of the book is that the food value of food types is &quot;the vibratory rate that can be measured in terms of its rotting ability.&quot;  The underpinnings of much of the book rests on the simplistic, gratuitous statements that the vibratory rate (undefined in any technical or scientific sense) of foods, and hence, the food value is &quot;reflected in amount of time it takes for a substance to decay.&quot; A significant section of the book is devoted to refuting the food value of soy, which is a restatement of a previously published one-sided view of soy products (Every health newsletter presents the pros and cons of soy products and every one has &quot;pros&quot; for tofu and soy products). It is not that every aspect of the book is wrong: certainly fresh, live food is better than food that is highly processed and filled with additives and preservatives. I didn't buy a book with this title to read that type of information. I found the significant and controversial &quot;points&quot; of the book to be unsubstantiated, vague, and unscientifically presented--and largely at odds with any viewpoint that I am familiar with that has data lending credibility and a scientific basis.	2000-12-17

Belief is first defined in the book as the regarding of something as true on the testimony of someone else. To believe is equivalent to taking a position on the truth of a statement and on the actuality of the matter stated. Before getting to this definition, the author addresses the \\"true\\" meaning of root words: how it's defined in advance based on other opinions versus the version that a person has in the back of his/her mind based on personal experience and how it's applied to the situational context.<br />Actually belief is one of the \\"classical\\" modes of possible attitudes: doubting, supposing, knowing and believing. These attitudes as the insight into a subject matter will make the distinction between knower and believer. The latter is able to regard a subject as true and real even without knowing the subject at all. It seems essential that two elements are presented when someone acts as a believer: unfamiliarity (lack of knowledge) with the subject matter and unconditional conviction of the truth. In other words, content cannot be verified but it's accepted. Also believing involving a person on whom the believer relies on.<br />The author discusses the importance of other two elements: to believe in something and to believe someone. The condition of believing in someone gives to belief a meaningful human act. Besides the fact of believing in something or someone, the author states that belief is driven by willing and love, it can't be demanded or be-stowed. The believer is placed in a condition of seeing something that would never be attainable by his/her own unaided sight, of seeing with the eyes of whom he/she believes.<br />Another idea shared by the author is seeing and knowing takes precedence over belief. Before someone accepts the testimony of another person, normally called witness, he/she must be sure that this person has authentic knowledge of those things, which are accepted in faith. In this sense, people's credibility and knowledge are judged as part of the believing process.<br />The author relates belief to freedom. No one who believes must believe, it's naturally a free act. The believer has an alternative of choice, believe or not believe, that is based on a set of processes that the author defines as \\"mental unrest\\". These processes are searching investigation, probing consideration, conferencing with oneself before deciding and being on the track of.<br />As a climax of the discussions presented, the author presents belief in two concepts: \\"acceptance of the principles of a religion\\" and Karl Jasper's concept of belief as a modern thought. In the former concept, the witness is God Himself. There is a revelation from God to man where He is conceived as a personal being capable of speech and the man is conceived as a being by nature receptive to God. In the latter concept, the author criticizes the arguments used by Karl Jaspers that leads to the questioning of the traditional religion belief. The author explores in more details how the belief assumes the actuality of revelation and how the modern experience of the \\"absence\\" of God leads to the \\"troubled atheism\\".<br />After discussing all the concepts above, the author digs into the principles of the Christianity believes: Trinity and Incarnation. He finishes the book with the question: Is it good to believe? The answer is based in the following: If God has really spoken, it is not only good to believe Him; rather the act of believing generates those things which in fact are goodness and perfection for man.<br />I think the book is well organized covering the topic from different angles and the author mentions opinions of people with different thoughts. At the end, the author biases the conclusion telling his believes in Christianity.<br />The book is easy to read because the author explains the ideas and \\"tries\\" to prove them in a logical way. Definitively this is not a scientific book. It deals with a controversial theme giving different thoughts based on religion and philosophical principles.	2000-12-13

I heard the author read an excerpt at the book's launch party, and I was hooked. The premise had quite an attention-getter (a dying man sends a coded message even as he sees his death approaching) and I loved the author's word-play.<br />The author tells his story in such a captivating fashion that, when the six-legged aligators start speaking telepathically with our heroes, I totally bought it. My disbelief was willfully suspended.<br />However, while the author could make me believe that a gator could talk and quote the Bible and such, he couldn't make me believe that a woman who knows people are out to kill her drinks from a bottle of wine that she finds at her doorstep simply because she thinks she knows who left it there for her. Similarly random behavior from the main characters (the board of directors of a major corporation voting in a new CEO on the basis of one unverified claim by one conflict-of-interest lawyer -- this is the action upon which the entire novel hangs, and I didn't buy it for a second) poke holes that not even a scripture-quoting gator can ignore. <br />This is an interesting case of good language but not-so-good writing. Jeffrey gets many bonus points for writing a first novel that's readable and even gripping, but loses some points for the believability of his human characters. I like the world he's created and the native inhabitants with which it is peopled. I'd be interested in returning to Rozner's World, should there ever be a sequel, but only if the human tour guides are a little more natural.	2000-12-12

When he resigned from the Clinton White House I was one of those eagerly awaiting his book.  I wasn't disappointed.  Certainly some of my impressions of the Clinton style of governing were verified.  I'd always felt that this was an administration that governed through reaction rather than an organized agenda.  This appeared to be a function of not only Bill Clinton's personality but also of Hillary's.  There was no doubt that Pres. Clinton used (and uses) an unusual personal magnetism to substitute for a coherent set of objectives.<br />I found this book refreshing because Stephanopoulos refrains from being overly self-serving.  So many of these tell-all White House memoirs have appeared to serve as an ego-booster for the author.  I don't sense this slant at all.  Mr. Stephanopoulos has been honest about his own ambitions, lending a qualifying air to his writing.<br />This book further illustrates that taking a White House job of significance can consume a worker's entire lifestyle.  One expects the President to live his job, but what of the inner circle staffers who are quickly forgotten to history, and to us? As with other books, this volume once again testifies to the seductiveness of power, and access to that power.<br />In the end, it remains a very enjoyable and readable book, being sufficiently gossipy without being bitchy.  It will make good reading regardless of the reader's political persuasion.	2000-12-10

The Phish Companion takes on a task that has never been taken on before: a truly comprehensive to the musical side of the Phish experience.  If you enjoyed Dean Budnick's book, you will floored by this one.  Perhaps the most important aspect of this is the fact that over 1,400 fans contributed work to the title in the form of essays, photos, song histories, setlists, reviews and statistics.  Interested in which version of David Bowie is the longest ever?  Check the Bowie table.  Looking for killer versions of Antelope?  A look over the table will give you an idea which is right for you.  Consider that for the first time, all the setlists in the book have been checked and re-verified for accuracy by a group of dedicated individuals.  Dig the newly un-earthed information about the &quot;first&quot; show for the ROTC kids, when did &quot;Blackwood Convention&quot; really kick off their career?  There's a TON of material in this book.  Much of it you may already know, but I'd lay good money that there are a few things in the book that even the biggest Phish trivia junkie wouldn't have learned otherwise.

Having read the \\"Sword and the Shield\\" thoroughly, I feel that it begs as many questions as it seeks to answer.  The book is a worthy undertaking at the outset, but it's poorly edited and far too long to hold the interest of anyone other than the avid student of Kremlinology or espionage fanatics looking for an encyclopedic chronology series of events in Soviet history.<br />There are many problems and oversights within the book's content.  Nowhere does Mitrokhin even explain what the acronym \\"KGB\\" actually stands for!  The same phrase \\"one of the most successful (il)legals ... X\\" keeps cropping up repeatedly.  There is no analysis of why, immediately after the war, defections suddenly (if Mitrokhin is right) started on a grand scale.  Why were there no defections up to this point given that the NKVD (forerunner to the MGB/KGB) knew the reality of Stalinist USSR long before the war?<br />The credibility of some of the information is clearly suspect.  Mitrokhin constantly refers to Soviet conspiracy theory and paranoia about Western countries' (especially the UK's) intentions towards the USSR coloring the judgment of the Centre and Politburo's decisions.  If this is the case, and it was as widespread as he claims, then surely it is reasonable to suggest that his own views and interpretations, drawn from official archives, must be colored by this ideological \\"fog\\" too.  There is no corroboration of a lot of his claims, made even more worrying by snide remarks about the failings of \\"communism\\", Soviet ideology and their frequently \\"absurd\\" claims.  Frankly,  Mitrokhin can hardly be taken as completely subjective in this regard and does not come to the argument with clean hands. He is, after all, a traitor in some people's eyes, with a political and personal ax to grind, and some of his arguments do not follow through.  For example, on the Soviet dissident's trials, he dismisses the Centre's paranoia of a Zionist plot and Western agitprop being behind much of the refusniks motives - yet fails to note that key refusnik, Sharanksy, once emigrated to Israel, subsequently became of the leading Zionist propagandists with very harsh views on the Palestinians.<br />In all, it's an interesting read, but buy the paperback and read it within the context of a possibly embittered man making claims than cannot be verified completely.  Given the developments in post-Perestroika CIS/Russia, whether a lot of what he claimed is now really nothing more than speculation hardly matters.	2000-12-03

Ironically, the epithet could apply to Barzun's own book.  Carelessly written and sloppily edited throughout, the book is rife with grammatical errors: missing words, commas where there should be semicolons and vice-versa, and clumsily worded sentences that seem to be a holdover from the author's native French syntax.<br />Even though this book was slow going at times, I persevered until the end.  Doing so changed the way I saw the rest of the book.  It became clear to me that Barzun didn't really write this book as a history lesson; his aim is not to teach, but to decry.  The first 679 pages are really a prologue to Part IV, which contains the chapters &quot;The Great Illusion&quot;, &quot;The Artist Prophet and Jester&quot;, &quot;Embracing the Absurd&quot;, and &quot;Demotic Life and Times&quot;.  In this fourth part of the book, which deals with the 20th century, his writing becomes more passionate--it is an invective, a diatribe.<br />For Barzun, Yeats is the last great poet, and Cubism the last real art movement.  Western civilization since the end of World War I is a welter of confusion.  To be fair, he does offer a plausible explanation for this &quot;decadence&quot; that doesn't blame that favorite scapegoat of conservatives everywhere, the Sixties (in fact, he says that the social justice movements of the sixties were continuations of movements that began in the Twenties and Thirties and were interrupted by WWII).  Instead, he traces the roots of our supposed current breakdown to the carnage of WWI and its aftermath.  At the turn of the century, he says, people were proclaiming what a joy it was to be alive, and art, literature, and music were bursting with new ideas.  All of that came to an abrupt halt when scores of young artists, writers and musicians were either killed in the war or kept away from their work.  When the war was over, there was a schism between past and present; people were forced to start from scratch: &quot;The reckless expenditure of lives was bound to make a postwar world deficient in talents as well as deprived of needful links to the prewar culture.&quot;  According to Barzun, we have never recovered.<br />Throughout the book Barzun highlights ideas that are key to Western civilization.  The forces of Abstraction and Emancipation, Self-Consciousness and Scientism, Analysis and Reductivism, coupled with the ravages of the world wars, culminate in the cultural anarchy he sees today.  The last chapter is a peculiarity.  Even though it takes current events as its subject, it is wholly written in the past tense, as in: &quot;In the last years of the era of nations, violence returned....Assault in the home, the office, and on city streets was commonplace and particularly vicious.&quot; or &quot;From their early teens, pupils carried guns, assaulted each other, and on occasion committed little massacres by shooting into a group at random with a rapid-fire weapon&quot;.  Why does he write about present-day conditions in the past tense?  Is it to give these final pages an authority he knows is lacking?  Is it to make this book not seem dated to those who may read it ten, twenty, fifty years from now?  Whatever the reason is, it's absurd.  Imagine reading sentences in this vein on every topic from recent and still-unfolding scientific developments (cloning) to current entertainment, and you get the idea of how bombastic this chapter gets.<br />Barzun says, of our time, &quot;No one is on record as exclaiming with Erasmus or Wordsworth 'Oh, what a joy to be alive!'&quot;  Maybe nobody he knows.  But there certainly must be someone out there, today, whose life has a sense of coherence and purpose, who isn't the bewildered, sloppily-dressed, self-hating dependent of the welfare state that Barzun paints as the typical turn-of-this-century Westerner.  Anyone?this-century Westerner.  Anyone?	2000-12-03

I verified it in my Bartlett's Familiar Quotations - which is a really handy book to have around - Who knew his name was Lawrence Peter? - but, unfortunately, that's not what I'm reviewing right now.<br />As I said in a recent review of another book, my quandary with serials is that, unless one is more patient than I - and can therefore wait for all the books to be available to read in one continuous marathon, one must recall who was whom, and who did what with/to whom etc. etc. from the last installment(s.) Waiting for an entire series to be complete is inconsistent with my philosophy that life is uncertain: eat dessert first! - that is, if one is allowed dessert - which I am not - see my review of Dr. Atkins' &quot;New Diet Revolution.&quot; But, I intentionally digress again. (When one is reviewing this newest Cornwell, procrastination and digression are a good thing and perhaps the better part of valor.)<br />Patricia Cornwell's latest installment in the saga of Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta, family, friends, and various evil-doers is merely OK. I have done other things since reading the previous installment (including reading some of Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan and therefore getting my &quot; female Quincy&quot; sagas mixed up.) So, I was frequently left foundering on this heavy, self-introspective and self-indulgent trip.<br />There's more trouble in sight at the end of this book (like the irksome notice on the screen of a TV show that says &quot;To Be Continued&quot;) and by the time it comes out I will be equally adrift (sigh.) Gee, I don't remember having this much confusion years ago with the Nancy Drew books!	2000-11-30

Surprised I liked it so much	Seems to me that the people who would read this book are white, middle-class conservative men with some link to the military--sorry about the generalization if it seems unfair. Moreover, the book is written in that unsophisticated prose style that I usually associate with popular consumer fiction, not &quot;real&quot; literature. But I thoroughly enjoyed this work and was surprised at Webb's historical accuracy and addressing of themes in US-Japan relationships--unpleasant facts that have only been written about in recent scholarly books about collusive ties between the US and post-War Japan (cf. Dower's &quot;Embracing Defeat&quot; and the new Hirohito biography).  Well, seems like Webb and others in the US military are well aware of MacArthur's personal and political faults as well (or maybe just the Marines). Happened to run across an obituary in the New York Times of one of the US defense attorneys of the wrongfully indicted Japanese general, which verified every one of Webb's narrative details! Gen. MacArthur's character comes to life and his arrogance is inextricably linked to the way he established US military policy toward East Asia's Pacific Crescent, a restructuring of Japan's own WWII Economic Co-Prosperity Sphere imperialism, but this time American style. The prose is smoothly-paced and highly readable; I whipped through this book in no time. As someone who has no connection to the world of men like Webb (whom I assumed represents the military elite who served in Vietnam and came to public attention in the Reagan-era Iran-Contra scandal), I was not only pleasantly surprised, but extremely impressed. I think this is an engaging, intriguing piece of work. Webb should be commended for producing a fascinating narrative that will stimulate and satisfy the minds of both lay reader and history buff alike.	2000-11-29

In this book, the authors do much more than just rehash some much pondered over points about the implications of the Gisin and Aspect experiments that verified Bell's Theorem. For those of you who haven't checked out what's happening in modern physics in the last 50 years or so, &quot;The mathematical statement derived by Bell in his theorem is known as Bell's inequality, and it is predicated on two major assumptions in local realistic theories-locality and realism.&quot; (p. 69) Aspect and then Gisin figured out a way to measure paired subatomic particles which refuted the locality assumption. Although Nadeau and Kafatos never make this exact point, one way to understand the refutation of localism is that in their wave structure, subatomic particles are extended infinitely throughout space and time (highly improbable, but nevertheless finitely probable). Hence in this sense, every particle/wave overlaps every other particle/wave and therefore, &quot;We are all connected.&quot;<br />Nadeau and Kafatos are at great (sometimes, too great) pains to show how slowly and laboriously many physicists have given up the assumption that mathematical models of external reality can have a one-to-one correspondence with that reality. They even imagine Einstein still living and contemplating the Aspect experiments, agreeing that he was wrong and Bohr was right. They spend a comparable amount of effort in painting a non-picture of our non-local universe, as their book title might imply. The reason I say &quot;non-picture&quot; is the fact that a central point of theirs is that we can not adequately visualize a more than three-dimensional universe. While the &quot;non-picture&quot; that they paint is at times fuzzy and not well worked out, a mere blueprint for further investigations, they propose that it is free of metaphysical assumptions (including the one-to-one correspondence theory).<br />In other chapters in their expansive book of modest size (240 pp.), they trace literature that rejects the narrow Darwinian interpretation of evolution and replaces it with an ecological view of the earth's biota as a self-regulating organinism (Ch. 6), trace the evolution of humans as symbol-using creatures and the emergence of self-consciousness, not as isolated in a separate mental realm, but rather as &quot;[deriving] its existence from embedded relations to [the larger whole of biological life]. (Ch. 7,.p. 144) and offer a critique of classical economic theories, showing how building an economic theory using the emerging ecological paradigm can account for and ameliorate overproduction based on a solely competitive model. (Ch. 10) <br />One of the threads of insight woven through each of these chapters is what Nadeau and Kafatos call the &quot;logic of complementarity.&quot; They are building on Bohr's conception of the complementarity of wave and particle. One of the implications of Quantum Theory is that a complete view of subatomic structure must rely on its being viewed as both wave-like and particle-like. When subatomic structure is not being observed it is wave-like, when it is being observed, it is particle-like. We also see in Einstein's general theory of relativity the complementary nature of time and space. They suggest &quot;that the logic of complementarity could be the logic of nature and that the use of this logic as a heuristic could serve to better explain the character of other profound oppositions in the natural process.&quot; (p. 103)<br />In various places in their book, they also trace the history of Western philosophical and scientific thought leading up to, through, and beyond Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory, and they trace the development of the Postmodernist movement as a reaction to the Classical Realist metaphysics implicit in much of earlier math and physics. In doing so, they are really trying to solve a communication problem for academics in C. P. Snow's two camps: &quot;Another of our large ambitions here is to demonstrate that our new understanding of the relationship between parts and wholes in physical reality can serve as the basis for a renewed dialog between the two cultures of humanist-social scientists and scientists-engineers.&quot; (p. 13) <br />In tracing the Postmodernist literature from roots in Nietsche and Husserl to more contemporary writers like Lacan and Foucault, they identify three major assumptions of Postmodernist metatheory and assert that &quot;the resulting view of human consciousness is an extension of Cartesian dualism and not in accord with our current scientific world view.&quot; (p. 165) Nadeau and Kafatos in no way intend to denigrate the work of the postmodernists, which they say &quot;has, in general, made us a more humane society and served as a source of liberation for large numbers of individuals.&quot; (p. 164) Their point is rather that &quot;since the postmodern view of the relationship between mind and world is one of the primary sources of our contemporary dispair and angst, the prospect that it could be displaced by an alternate and much more positive view is certainly worth considering.&quot; <br />Toward the end of the book, they sketch Capra's &quot;ecological world view,&quot; which is distinguishable in terms of five related shifts of emphasis, and &quot;which is entirely consistent with the understanding of physical reality revealed in modern physics.&quot; (p. 213) Here is a sketch of the core of this idea: 1) properties of parts must be understood as dynamics of the whole, 2) every structure manifests a fundamentally dynamic web of relationships, 3) human observers and their processes of knowledge must be embedded in knowledge descriptions, 4) phenomena exist as mutually consistent relationships; knowledge is an interconnected network of relationships founded on self-consistency and agreement withfact, and 5) the whole constituting webs of relationships cannot be represented by our necessarily approximate descriptions.<br />I can tell you this much about &quot;The Non-Local Universe.&quot; Even though I had a passing acquaintance with the writings of visionary physicists, before I read this book, I felt like a body trapped in a time sequence. Now I have a different view of myself, connected to other beings and to the Universe, past, present and future....	2000-11-28
US	50393530	R3SZFNZC7IGCV9	1565634861	905965845	Beyond Resurrection	Books	4	14	17	N	N	Why seek the living among the dead?	Wedderburn raises some questions few Christians dare raise, that Christians need to raise.  Can the physical resurrection of Jesus be historically verified?  If it were to be historically verified, would it be meaningful and important to our Christian faith?  If resurrection is not a part of our theology, what can we believe in?  The author states his purpose as &quot;to move beyond 'resurrection' and a faith bewitched by that concept to a faith that is thoroughly this-worldly.&quot;  I think he did a marvelous job raising the issues, but his attempt to move one toward anything new was weak.<br /> Part 1 examined the historical evidence for a physical resurrection.  There is circumstantial evidence, and the author concludes that something definitely occurred that first Easter morning in Jerusalem.  However, we do not know what that something was, so we are compelled to either believe it was physical resurrection because of our &quot;need to believe&quot; it, or take a non-committal, agnostic position.  Actually, I was impressed with how much circumstantial evidence there is.  Wedderburn concludes that belief based on our &quot;need to believe&quot; is not justified, that in fact we do not need to believe it, and the lack of knowing what took place calls for the agnostic position.  I am skeptical of the importance Wedderburn assigns to the possibility of &quot;knowing what happened.&quot;  Suppose we did have enough evidence that we knew, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Jesus physically rose that morning.  Could we then say we &quot;knew what happened?&quot;  We would know that once there was a dead body, then there was no body but a live human, who was the same human who once lived in the dead body.  But Christian tradition says that through this event, God acted to reconcile sinful mankind back to himself and make it possible to live in eternity with Him.  If we knew that there was a resurrection, would that mean we &quot;knew what happened?&quot;  I think not.<br/> Part 2 was on coming to terms with the demythologizing of the gospel, growing a faith that is not dependent on the physical resurrection of Jesus.  Wedderburn makes a very good start at this.  He made me think very seriously about my own religious faith, especially about whether it is essential to believe in individual survival after death.  I believe the author raises some very good questions, but he leaves little room for the Christian to claim there is anything unique or advantageous about his religion.  There is still the opportunity to focus on Jesus' death, that he suffered and died for us, for our sins.  Wedderburn touches on this, the belief that while God is not omnipotent in the way we might like him to be, he suffers with us.  However, this is not developed in this work.  I am not convinced that a theology of Jesus' suffering for us (without a resurrection) adds anything that the &quot;suffering servant&quot; writings in the Old Testament don't give us already.  In short, I could find everything I need for a strong religious faith in Judaism, and still hold to traditions and myths that are already familiar and meaningful to me.  Wedderburn seems to want to lead me to a resurrection-less faith within Christianity, but even if he had convinced me to abandon my belief in the resurrection, I would not follow.  Why would I want to be an odd Christian, when I could be a good Jew?<br /> Nevertheless, this work is very valuable and should be the subject of good discussion among open-minded Christians.  Unfortunately, it is not accessible to Christians who do not have some familiarity with scholarly biblical criticism.  It is written for theologians, and Wedderburn offers little help to the theologians who have congregations, who might want to evoke some discussion among their flock about these issues.  Most of what Christians hear second- or third-hand about this book will be negative, and that is unfortunate.  Most of us could use the close self-examination of our faith that Wedderburn challenges us to make.	2000-11-24

Some of the presentations are classics -- those of Horne, Mantik, and Palamara, for example.  Many areas are covered with considerable depth and intelligence.  One area, however, remains a mystery -- what really happened to the Presidential Limousine after the assassination?<br />For some reason, there is a dearth of limo information in this book, other than an unverified account of a mystery lone witness that the author calls a &quot;Man from the Ford Motor Company&quot; but who is, in truth, &quot;The Man from the Rouge&quot;.  This apocryphal story, that takes places outside of the critical timeline of the limousine, does little to further our knowledge of what actually happened, why, and by whom.  Instead, it functions as little more than a red herring -- we know nothing more after finishing the limo chapter than we did when we started.  If there were to be any agenda, it would be to draw responsibility away from the Secret Service and place it with the Ford Motor Company.  <br />Ironically, both the &quot;Smoking Gun&quot; chapter and the otherwise valuable &quot;Timeline&quot; chapter further the mystery -- the &quot;Smoking Gun&quot; chapter contains a reference to the Man From the Rouge's Story that is contradicted by all known information -- namely that 100x was 'stripped to metal' by 11/25/63.  And the Timeline, which gives considerable information about the limo prior to the assassination, gives almost no information subsequent to it; so we are left with the impression that the 8,000 pound SS-100-X sat in a time warp for three days, at which time it was then, magically, beamed to the Rouge!  <br />However, if and when you start asking questions about what really happened to 100X and are not finding answers in MIDP,there is a great deal of information available.  You might consider starting with my website on the JFK Assassination Presidential Limousine SS-100-X at [...]<br />Pamela McElwain-Brown	2000-11-22

Though no new ground is covered in this treatise, it is very well written and translated and would be an excellent read before embarking on a report or essay on the battle of Rome.<br />Understandable and enlightening, this book covers the life of the general as well as most other books currently in print though not as well as some that are difficult to find today. Without question factual, this book was meticulously researched and verified. Still, since we have little evidence from a historical standpoint other than what has alrady been offered, there is nothing new to glean from the pages of this book.<br />One of the best attibutes of this book is the lack of embellishment or dramatic affectation of the battles Hannibal fought. The facts are credible and thoroughly investigated.<br />Because of the interesting pitch and composition of the writing, this would be an ideal book for teachers to require students from high school onwards to read. It is compelling enough to hold their interest and edcuational enough to impart some knowledge of the antiquities.	2000-11-22

Upon returning home I couldn't put the book down!  Having read almost the entire thing in one sitting, I must say it was an enjoyable piece of literature.  I have read many books on past lives, but this one was different.  The author's focus is on how events in our past lives influence our behaviors (even mental health!) in THIS lifetime.  It was fascinating to learn of real cases of people being overly affected by traumas in an entirely other lifetime... and thouroughly different from the usual focus of books on reincarnation.  <br />There isn't much exploration of the afterlife, but only of the effects of past events on our present lifetimes.  That is what makes this book unique... to view the metaphysical world through its influence of the world of psychology.<br />Dr. Fiore's writing style is very casual, making the reader feel as if she is TELLING the stories, and logically arranged.  She even renders the transcripts of her hypnotic regression sessions easy to follow... that's no small feat, as all to often such material can leave a reader confused.  In all, it is not a challenging book, but one that is easily understood, yet thought- provoking.<br />The cases were obviously well researched, seeing as she personally obtained the material from her patients... and verified it through the effects upon their lives and mental states.  Therefore, there is no need to bog down the readers with tireless historical data, as some authors do, since the focus is on verification through the psychological effects on her patient.	2000-11-21

Due to his dual subjects, his chronology largely limits itself to the last two decades of Callas' life (she became seriously involved with Onassis in 1959), but within this time frame he has come up with some startling new revelations, including the astonishing assertion (supported by convincing evidence) that Callas gave birth to a son by Onassis in 1960. The baby died the same day it was born, and this tragic event affected the entire rest of their relationship. There is a reverent, almost mystical tone in Gage's writing about the pair, a feeling that their romance was fated to happen and should have turned out much more happily than it did. This is backed up by the opinions of numerous people close to the couple that Onassis' impulsive pursuit of and marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy was the greatest mistake of his life.<br />Undoubtedly Onassis and Callas come vividly to life in these pages as people, warts and all. About Callas the musician Gage is less convincing. Although he speaks denigratingly about the false stories of the diva that have been uncritically perpetuated by biographers copying from each other, Gage himself does the same on occasion. For example, he repeats the standard tale of the January 1958 Rome Opera &quot;walkout,&quot; that Callas was voiceless and struggling against hecklers from the very start of the performance. In fact, as Michael Scott has pointed out, a broadcast tape is readily available of the performance which belies both these contentions. Overall, too, Callas, even with her voice in decline, remained much more interested in singing after she met Onassis than the rather indolent portrait that emerges from these pages would indicate.

A better title would be: &quot;A skeptic's philosophical answer to recent proposals of Intelligent Design as the probable cause of life and our universe&quot;!    The modern search for origins is an essential search for truth, truth which can be verified by reason (mathematics), models of systematic logic (the sequential organization of DNA), and the astounding correlation of laws of the universe.    To keep it simple (and it is not), consider the permutations of the possible combinations of the number of nucleotides in a single living cell, such as a bacteria.  We are talking about 7 million DNA nucleotides. To get an idea of the startling numbers of permutations of these 7 million, consider the permutation of just the number 14.  This would be: 14! = 14x13x12x11x10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 = more than 87 billion combinations.  Think of the possible combinations of not just 14, but of 7,000,000!  This is for the chance of &quot;self-organization&quot; of the correct sequence of DNA nucleotides to form a functioning single cell. Would you like to try it on your PC? Don't bother, it's much too big...something like 10 to the 56th power! One chance out of 10 to the 56th power???     To get an idea of this comparison, imagine two scientists standing in front of Mt. Rushmore National Monument.  One of them says, &quot;What a wonderful likeness of our presidents!&quot; The other says, &quot;Isn't if amazing that these faces were carved out of the solid rock by the chance natural action of wind, rain, snow and lightning!&quot;  Foolish?  Not really, since the actual chance for these faces to occur by natural forces are actually BETTER than the 1 to 10 to the 56th power chance of the correct sequence of DNA nucleotides to form a single cell.    Proof of Intelligent Design?  Most mathematicians would think so, but not a Skeptic Magazine editor!  For those searching for the the truth of our origins, perhaps it would be better for them to study Stephen Hawking or Nobel Laureate, Steven Weinberg, rather than the caustic comment of Skeptic Magazine editor, Michael Shermer.	2000-11-19

I have been fascinated with this period since I was a little girl, and I could hardly put the book down the first time I read it. <br />Pauline Gedge knows Egyptian daily life very well, and her strength is in recreating it. As far as the historical events and personalities go, sometimes I agreed with her interpretation, sometimes not. <br />The idea that Tiye married Akhenaton is not historically verified, though it does weave together some facts in an intriguing way. I first discovered that interpretation in a book called Oedipus and Akhenaten, which theorized that Akhenaten was the historical Oedipus, and Gedge has certainly gone with this interpretation. It is intriguing for the novel, and she makes a good case, especially in details like the role of the seer, Amenhotep son of Hapu. I have to say, though, I don't really believe that it happened this way. I also disagreed with her view of Akhenaten as a weak dreamer. He was many things, possibly mad, but anyone looking at sculptures of him can see that, whatever he was, he wasn't weak. <br />I have the same feeling about Nefertiti and her &quot;viper heartedness.&quot; To suit certain interpretations of the facts, Nefertiti had to be made vain and power hungry. I'm sure she wasn't perfect, but I just couldn't see her as the hollow, shallow character she was made to be.<br />Other interpretations were spot on, or at least interesting. I liked the relationship of Mutnodgeme and Horemheb, and the tragic love story that weaves delicately through the major part of the novel. Ankhesenamun and Tutankhamun's brief, sad story felt real to me, as well Horemheb's eventual motive for murder. <br />One thing this book did leave me wanting: The story of Amunhotep and Tiye in their youth.	2000-11-17
US	50941921	R3QBG7XKHYO1NG	096670360X	281307387	Stolen Valor : How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History	Books	1	76	129	N	N	Revenge of the Pogues (REMFs)	It is no accident that the negative reviews herein are all from grunts and others who actually fought the war--most former pogues (REMF in the army, rear area commando, etc..) think that this is a wonderful book.  Let me offer the view of one Marine Corps infantryman who served in both the Vietnam and Gulf Wars and knows when his \\"valor\\" is being \\"stolen\\" and by whom. <br /> The most useful sections of this book, and the issues that most readers have gotten caught up with,  is the coverage of individuals masquerading as Vietnam veterans, almost all of this material we have seen before in the newspapers and on TV.  Had the author stayed with that topic he would have had a coherent and logical book study.  Alas the coverage of pseudo veterans is simply a warm-up for longwinded attacks on victims of agent orange, PSPD, bad dreams, or even more inexplicably, Gulf War victims of Gulf illness, individuals who sue big companies, etc.   <br /> Stolen Valor  does a grave disservice to those who endured as grunts. After decrying the stereotyping of Vietnam veterans, the authors engaged in a more vicious stereotyping than returning grunts ever had to endure from the most fervent anti-war type.  No matter how you cut it the overall impact of this book is to bring under suspicion all Vietnam veterans, especially those who are having difficulties and who need help the most.  The benefits of  \\"outing\\" a number of misguided frauds who think they were in Vietnam,  is far outweighed by the damage done to those suffering from  a variety of maladies which the author believes do not exist, particularly PSPD and illnesses from exposure to agent orange. <br /> The two biggest enemies of the grunt in Vietnam, after the VC and the NVN,  was the pogue and the administrative system.  Pogues of all ranks  grabbed R&amp;R's especially to favored locations like Australia, made decisions that many grunts never recovered from in supply etc.... and wrote each other up for medals.  (It is no accident that the primary author of this  book got his bronze star with combat V deep in the rear with the gear)   The admin system repeatedly lost a grunt's SRB (service record book), lost his pay record, lost his medical record, often provided him with an erroneous DD 214 as he left the service,--some died before their records were straightened out, others went home without medical records or without pay for months, many got out of the service with invalid DD 214's.  At times throughout 1967 and 1968 the Marine Corps Morgue at DaNang had to call in an FBI team from the states to assist in identifying a backlog of unidentified bodies, lacking dog tags and/or their records,  that took up so much space they prevented  \\"normal\\" operations.  For the writers of Stolen Valor however  the wasted bodies in the Da Nang Marine Corps Morgue never died because their records did not show it.  <br /> Most tragic is the range of errors or omissions in this book.  There is valid and reliable evidence to show the impact of Agent Orange, which is on the same level of reliability as the evidence that smoking causes lung cancer. (Lost in the coverage is the fact that any  Veterans Administration association between agent orange and a narrow range of diseases have all been verified by the National Academy of Sciences which probably explains why only 8,500 veterans out of 2.6 million Vietnam veterans have so far successfully pursued VA benefits for Agent Orange).   There is such a thing as PSPD, which is particularly widespread among former grunts. Colin Powell never served as a company commander or any other combat command.   Indeed, like the author of Stolen Valor, General Powell assiduously avoided combat duty over his time in Vietnam, quite an achievement for a ground officer.  After 1966 the military had a very active program, dictated by politics and the Pentagon, to keep down the number of black and minority casualties and it worked.  The claim that no Marine ever went into North Vietnam ignores the significant number of Marines who served with Z patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin beginning in 1964, those who served in air rescue, those who served in elite recon and patrolling units often under CIA guidance.  Much of this misinformation is used to besmirch the reputation of a number of veterans who have written books, including One Tough Marine, who had the misfortune of not having their records in order to the satisfaction of these authors.  <br /> In sum, this book is characterized by scattered organization, poor writing, fuzzy thinking and unreliable use of sources.  Nowhere do we find any coverage of the validity of relying on a DD 214 as the sole source of evidence.  Even more troubling is the complete avoidance of any examination of the relationship between the DD 214, reality and memory.  Any infantryman knows that if you get ten men who served in the same firefight to describe their experiences you will get ten different wars. And none of those ten accounts will ever appear on a DD 214, or in any \\"official history\\" for that matter. That is the infantryman's war.  Such realities have never troubled the pogue who compiled this book.   What infantryman thought as he left Vietnam and the military that he would be pursued in later life by a pogue waving a DD 214 that he regarded as the word of God!	2000-11-12

US	48249512	R3W2EPHBSM0Q3F	0802805728	24132673	012: Pluralism (Louvain Theological & Pastoral Monographs)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An intelligent treatment of the question of salvations	In the contemporary religious situation, it is no longer possible for Christianity to regard itself in the insular manner which has characterized so much of its historical relationships with other traditions.  Rather, with the technology's breakdown of cultural and geographical boundaries, Christians cannot consider themselves exclusively within their own community, but must also position themselves responsibly with respect to the world's other major religious traditions and adopt a philosophical stance toward these other faiths.  These stances have taken three principal forms: exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism.  Exclusivism and pluralism are problematic for a Christian approach to the contemporary situation because they do not address the fact that all of the major faith traditions make faith claims and have notions of eschatological fulfillment which, in the grounds of public verifiability and coherence in discourse, are equally valid.  Thus, to publicly adopt a philosophical stance which privileges the faith claims of Christianity over those of other religions is ot raise internal, confessional faith convictions ot the level of absolute public truth.  Gillis argues convincingly in his book that with pluralism, the paradigm that is most sensitive to the fact of diverse religious claims worldwide, the truth claims of any one faith are relativized in the light of the parity between the faiths' competing claims. The conflict in terms of matters of religion, Gillis argues, is that there are no grounds upon which one can philosophically base religious claims in an absolute manner.  Absolute claims that use philosophical language, such as &quot;it is the case that...,&quot; appeal to an objective ontological truth which simply cannot be verified in matters of religious faith.  In issues of God or whatever name one gives to the Absolute, such objective claims simply cannot coherently be made and supported publicly in inter-faith discourse.<br />Exclusivism, as Gillis defines it, arrogantly elevates Christianity's claims avove those of other faiths and denies salvation to anyone who does not share these claims.  It implies an objective quality to its claims by maintaining that Christianity is the only path to salvation.  Inclusivism attempts to pull other faiths in under the &quot;umbrella&quot; of Christian salvation.  It asserts that other faiths lead one to salvation in Christ by virtue of the fact that through these traditions, one implicitly seeks to affirm Christian grace and Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.  Thus, inclusivism also does not allow for other salvations as the other traditions might choose to define them, but rather re-defines their salvation on their Christian terms. Gillis' book is outstanding in that in it, he considers these issues of inter-faith relations in a global community with a sensitivity not found in the exclusivist and inclusivist positions.  Rather, he opts for pluralism, through which he states that in the contemporary, globally-interrelated state of religious affairs, it is no longer logical for any one faith to maintain that it can make claims upon absolute ultimate reality.  Gillis' more circumspect position allows the various world faiths to exist on an equal ground, without the triumphalism which can at times infect religions' perspectives on other faiths.  Pluralism affirms the equality of the major faith traditions' truth claims, and the equal possibility each holds for its particular vision of salvation or liberation.  Pluralism, as Gillis defines and discusses it, remains the most tenable perspective from which to regard the relationship of &quot;salvific parity&quot; between faiths, as with the expansion of our knowledge of the diverse and complex religious universe, one no longer needs to believe that Christ is exclusively the sole way to any form of salvation or liberation.	2000-11-11

Although on the one hand, it's ultimately a barrier to further growth if you try to make something into a philosophy with certain dogmatic strictures, on the other hand, I found Castaneda's books hard to apply to my own life, until I started reading books by other Toltec writers. <br />I believe Ken Eagle Feather has a superb handle on these concepts and he does a good job in conveying what they mean.<br />On a side note, I don't believe book reviews should descend into personal name-calling.  Frankly, a lot of Castaneda's stuff could be labeled New Age crap too, and has been done so by various anthropologists and others who have investigated his life.  It depends on your point of view, and what you find valuable.  What is real?  The point is, even if don Juan was not real, how valuable was Castaneda's portrayal of him?  How much could you learn from him?  Ask Native cultures about the value of stories that cannot be independently verified or seem \\"unreal.\\"  The same, then, applies to Eagle Feather: Even if you don't believe that he has been taught by \\"the man\\" don Juan, how much can you learn from what he's written?<br />Now, in other books Eagle Feather does delve into things like chakras and out-of-body experiences and chanelling, based on his experiences with the Monroe Institute.  Depending on how much credibility the author his built with you, and how much stock you put into those phenomena, that will bias you one way or the other.  Personally, I feel that his corroboration of various Toltec concepts through diverse explorations only adds to the validity of this material. <br />Put simply: \\"A Toltec Path\\" is an excellent handbook for learning about the way of the warrior. It is not, as Eagle Feather himself says, a replacement for Castaneda's works.  Instead, it's a complement, a sort of Cliff Notes, and a very comprehensive one at that.  Indeed, I appreciate having all of the major concepts in one place.<br />Moreover, I'd have to say that I'm not actually a huge Castaneda fan, I've read less than half of his books.  But through neo-Toltec writers like Sanchez and Eagle Feather, I feel that I've taken advantage of the available information and used it in my own way to help craft my own path.  And that is invaluable.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2000-11-09

In fact, this has to be the best book ever written about stupid ways to die and lose fertility.  Anyone will feel smarter and better about themselves after reading these stories!<br />This book is about &quot;celebrating self-removal of incompetent genetic material for the human race.&quot;  In essence, the book proves that &quot;common sense is not so common.&quot;<br />The book's premise is very well framed to put you in a humorous mood.  The idea is that when people do stupid things that get them killed or keep them from having children, they thus perform a service by improving the gene pool for the remaining humans.  Ms. Northcutt uses many witty quotes to emphasize this point, and establishes the mood well.<br />She has rules for these awards.  To win the Darwin Award, you must (1) die or be unable to procreate, (2) show really bad judgment, (3) cause your own downfall, (4) have the ability to use sound judgment (are not permanently mentally impaired) and (5) have the incident verified by someone else.  If you don't meet all these tests, you can still get an honorable mention, or be described as an urban legend or a personal account.  I thought these distinctions made good sense, because the story's focus and credibility weighs heavily on the interest it creates for the reader drawn to this subject.<br />The stories are grouped around themes:  comeuppances with animals, problems with relatives, criminal misadventures, problems with fire and explosives, fatal falls, military goofs, macho errors, unsafe sex, watery deaths, and genital-related stories.  Some stories could have fit into four or more categories, so it must have been a challenge to fit everything into a group.<br />Here are a few of my favorite stories:<br />The couple who crashed their car driving at 80 miles an hour while having sex totally nude at the same time.<br />The chicken that fell down a well and was saved after six people drowned in the process.<br />The man who crushed out his cigarette in a pail of explosives, blowing them and him up.<br />The ex-firefighter arsonist who died while starting the fire that was designed to make him a hero so he could get his old job  back.<br />The couple who left their car and went for a stroll amidst the tigers in an wild animal park, and served as tiger meat.<br />The man who threw his wife out the window where she stuck in some wires.  He then jumped after her, missed the wires, and died.  She was saved.<br />Three guys to stole a large pig, and strapped it in their truck.  The pig's thrashing caused the truck to crash, and the three men died because they hadn't attached their own seat belts.  The pig survived.<br />The man found nude, dead of hypothermia, in a killer whale pool at an amusement park.<br />The thief who had tilted a Coke machine to shake a free bottle out, and was crushed when the machine fell on him.<br />The woman who died of hypothermia and dehydration in a tent after starting a 21 day spiritual cleansing diet intended to free her from needing to eat food or drink liquids.  She would get all of her nutrition from the atmosphere instead.  You start with no food or water for 7 days, then go 14 days with only sips of water, then take nothing.  Hmmm.<br />I rated the book down one star, though, because a lot of the seeming stupidity was probably related to partial accidents in stupid circumstances rather than complete intention.  I found many of the stories possibly mischaracterized in this way.  For example, one story has a man using electric current to kill fish.  He then ends up in the pond (described as going in to get the fish) and dies from the current.  Now, you can read that as not realizing that electric current could kill him, or you can read that as he accidentally fell overboard before turning the current off.  Now, in either case, I don't recommend this as a way to fish, but the story doesn't ring true as the &quot;funny&quot; story it is portrayed to be.<br />I also suspect that a lot of these stories have an unreported connection to alcohol or substance abuse.  The verification in many cases is after the fact or is in a publication (which may have an incentive to &quot;improve&quot; the stories to make them better, and sell more issues), which probably adds to the tendency for &quot;stupidity&quot; bias in the interpretations.<br />After you finish having a good laugh, I suggest that you consider how you may put yourself into a dangerous situation that could make you a candidate for this award.  For example, do you ever drive or pilot a plane while under the influence?  Do you ever go near open windows in high places when you are unsteady?<br />I suspect that most of us have some foolishness that we need to eliminate if we want to avoid these awards.  In my case, I think I need to be more careful when using equipment.  I tend to go the fast route, rather than the safest one.  I'm going to slow down and be safer in the future.<br />May all of your &quot;hang man&quot; experiences be on paper!before turning the current off.  Now, in either case, I don't recommend this as a way to fish, but the story doesn't ring true as the &quot;funny&quot; story it is portrayed to be.  <br />I also suspect that a lot of these stories have an unreported connection to alcohol or substance abuse.

No matter how you cut it the overall impact of this book is to bring under suspicion all Vietnam veterans, especially those who are having difficulties and who need help the most--that is the field infantryman.   <br /> Stolen Valor is written (or moreaccurately compiled) by a pogue  and is based narrowly on the administrative record--nothing else matters to the author in his frenzied search to support his version of the truth except the record, especially the DD 214.  The author is described as holding the record for requesting records under the freedom of information (FOI) act.  If that is so, and it is possibly true, it is indeed troubling that the FOI act can be misused in such a way.  Indeed, such misuse of the FOI may threaten the entire future of the act for researchers who use it responsibly.<br /> The two biggest enemies of the grunt in Vietnam, after the VC and the NVN,  was the pogue and the administrative system.  Pogues of all ranks  grabbed R&amp;R's especially to favored locations like Australia, made decisions that many grunts never recovered from, and wrote each other up for medals.

He strongly refutes the traditionally accepted belief that the monument was constructed by 17th century Mughal emperor Shah Jehan as a mausoleum to his deceased wife Mumtaz Mahal, by attempting to prove that it was in fact a 12th century temple-palace seized from Raja Jaisingh of Jaipur and converted to accommodate Mumtaz's tomb.  Mr Oak forcefully argues his case on several fronts, his first point being that the only original source of  the claim for the Taj Mahal to be Shah Jehan's creation is an inaccurate and misinterpreted journal written by 17th century French jewel merchant and sometime India traveller, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, and that all other subsequent accounts were either based on Tavernier's unverified statements or were sycophantic additions after Shah Jehan's time. Mr Oak quotes firstly from Mullah Abdul Hamid Lahori, Shah Jehan's own official chronicler, that Mumtaz's body was laid to rest in a &quot;lofty sky-high palace with a majestic dome&quot; procured from Raja Jaisingh. He further quotes from the journals of Tamerlane (1336-1405) and Babur (1483-1530) to show that this palace pre-dates Shah Jehan and also points to the notable absence of any claim by Shah Jehan himself for its construction. He particularly refutes Tavernier's claim of having seen the beginning and end of the entire construction work being carried out during his sojourn at Agra by pointing out the enormous discrepancies between the three periods during which Tavernier stayed at Agra, between 1641 and 1663, and the period over which it is clamed to have been constructed (1631-1653). He also disputes the latter part of the presumed construction period as being implausible as they coincide with Shah Jehan's incarceration, according to all accounts, and he conjectures that what Tavernier saw was actually the work to reconvert it to a mausoleum and not the original construction itself, and advances convincing details on construction costs and  labour requirements to support his theory. Mr Oak further ridicules the widely conflicting other existing accounts, which appear to differ on everything from the year of Mumtaz's death to the time and cost spent in building the Taj Mahal.  His second point is etymological. Mumtaz's real name was Arjumand Banu Begum, and she was conferred the honorific title Mumtaz-ul-Zamani by her father-in-law Jehangir, but never Mumtaz Mahal, and he contends that she acquired the addition &quot;Mahal&quot; posthumously by virtue of being entombed in a palace, and that on the contrary it was not the monument which acquired her name, as latter-day historians would have us believe. He points out that the term &quot;Mahal&quot; is exclusively used in India, is not of Arabic or Persian origin therefore not of the Mughal period, and contends that it is instead of Sanskrit origin. One can easily identify &quot;Mahal&quot; as a contraction of  the Sanskrit &quot;Mahalaya&quot; or &quot;Maha-alaya&quot; meaning &quot;Grand Residence&quot; and when &quot;Taj  or Tej&quot; meaning a crown is the qualifying adjective, the term takes on a whole new meaning, i.e. Grand Residence of the Crown, or Grand Royal Palace. &quot;Tejas&quot; is also the Sanskrit term for &quot;resplendence&quot; and &quot;Teja Mahalaya&quot; also means &quot;Resplendent Shrine&quot;. The latter contentions would seem to be borne out by the immensity and opulence of the Taj Mahal and its environs, which are more consistent with the structure of a palace complex than that of a mausoleum and Mr Oak elaborates sufficiently on this point. The author also supports his assertions to the Taj Mahal's pre-Shah Jehan Hindu origins with a wealth of corroborative detail, from the &quot;Trishul&quot; present on its dome to specific details on its decor. He is also able to relate several of the terms in current use to Sanskrit origins. It is a pity though, that relevant photographs are not also included in his book..  Mr Oak's reasoning is methodical and his method of drawing conclusions is reminescent of the incisive and logical cross-examination methods of the courtroom. His arguments up to this point can however be considered to be circumstantial. His continual harping on Mughal tyranny and perfidy also detract from his otherwise brilliant analysis, and constitute a digression from the central point, i.e. who built the Taj Mahal. For instance the negative character traits of Shah Jehan and Mumtaz Mahal and their incongruency with the building of a monument of love from one to the other, while being paradoxical, are not necessarily proofs of  Shah Jehan's not building the Taj Mahal.  It is therefore highly commendable to find that Mr Oak has supplemented his excellent literary research with scientific methods. Radiocarbon dating was performed on some door samples taken from the Taj Mahal by Prof Marvin Mills of  the Pratt Institute Archaeological History Department, New York, who with Dr. Evan Williams of the Brooklyn College radiocarbon laboratory, thereby determined that the monument pre-dates Shah Jehan by at least three centuries. Prof Mills has already presented his findings at an annual meeting of the Archaeological Society and it might be interesting to include a reference of one of his relevant publications, in this already well-referenced book. Archaeometric methods are indubitably of great value in determining the true ages of buildings like the Taj Mahal and the fact of their inclusion considerably adds to the strength of Mr Oak's theory.  Radiocarbon dating is based on the measurement of the constant decay of C-14 radioactivity in organic materials and is a relatively well-established technique, limited however to materials such as wood and fibres. Thermoluminescence is another recent technique applicable among others, to pottery sherds, baked brick and sediments and is also fairly precise for dates up to the last 3000 years, but its application requires careful sampling which is not easily handled by the non-specialist. Other relevant absolute radioactive dating techniques are the relatively new Optically Stimulated Luminescence method and Uranium-Thorium or Potassium-Argon dosage methods. Any or several of these techniques, properly applied to the study of the Taj Mahal, would unambiguously reveal her true age. It would indeed be in the interest of science, history and posterity, to have a complete study undertaken by competent scientists. The famous Shroud of Turin was proved by C-14 dating to be a medieval era fabrication instead of its acclaimed status as the Shroud which wrapped the body of the Christ. Similarly, scientific dating is the only honest, truly objective means of  determining when the Taj Mahal was first built, if and when alterations were carried out, and to what extent. The Taj Mahal complex is also a rich archaeological treasure house that needs to be explored to better understand Indian history and to put all the various myths of whatever origin, to rest. This has nothing to do with belittling the achievements of one community or another. For all we know every one of the stories surrounding the Taj Mahal could be a myth and the truth be elsewhere. This book is an excellent treatise on the Taj Mahal and its origins. In spite of the author's obvious prejudices, it is on the whole, objective, excellently researched, well-referenced and logically presented, and should prove to be a valuable aid to all persons who are interested in obtaining an honest perspective of Indian history.	2000-10-26

William R. Uttal provides an excellent outline for a new behaviorism that is not only modern but also purely scientific. Cognitive psychology is nothing but theoretical pseudoscientific junk. The author proves that there is a real need for a scientific psychology, something that is based upon the scientific method. There to many theories of mind out there, none of which can be verified empirically and scientifically and the result is worthless garbage that helps no one.  A psychophysical behaviorism is certainly the way to go, to bring science and not conjecture into modern psychology. Scientists can not observe cognitive process; such processes are not accessible. So why should we rely on introspection to lead us astray? I do disagree that neuroreductionistic methods are of no help. Science will eventually be able to identify neural processes involved with behavior, maybe not at this point in time but with new technology evolving scientists may be able to accurately pinpoint all neural mechanisms of behavior.	2000-10-25

Dear Readers,<br />I urge you to read this book if you are truly concerned about this issue and then get the Senate Committee book indicated at the end of this review.  I grew up in Ohio as well as the other reviewer and I can tell you and especially him that he is wrong.  I spent 17 months hospitalized after being &quot;gassed in the gulf&quot; and medevacced out unconscious to Germany following a total body seizure and over 6 hours of loss of consciousness.  The 12 eyewitness written accounts of what had happened to me were gathered by my Brigade Commander and he included a personal statement that accompanied my medevac file.  That portion of the file was sealed and CLASSIFIED was written over its outer jacket. I personally saw over 300 seriously wounded long term nerve gas related patients come in and out of the research ward of one of the military's largest hospitals for over one year.  I didn't even recognize my own wife at 2 months after the medevac and could barely speak.  Mr. Clueless from Columbus may believe whatever bull Schwarzkopf or any General wants to feed him, but it will never dispute the true eyewitness facts of that war that have rarely been told.  In fact many of us now retired army and marine disabled veterans from the Gulf question whether he even received the reports of chemical contamination or whether he wanted greater confirmation due to the relatively low number of serious nerve agent injuries.  Columbus should know how the military works and how reporting up the chain of command sometimes gets turned around right on top of you because most careerists are too worried about their ratings to report anything negative to, for example, a Brigade level commander.  YOU MUST REMEMBER, the Media was under complete military control during the Gulf War.  Had they been with the Saudi unit I was with they would have seen a number of serious injuries in verified areas of chemical detection--that were verified by the Select Senate Committee in eyewitness testimony from Americans and Foriegn Coalition NCO's and Officers--just like the book indicates.  If Mr. Columbus wants to keep on believing his own version due to his prior service visits to the local N.B.C. chemical training chamber he can do so without remorse and continue on with his merry life.  If Mr. Columbus cares about the truth and wants the real facts and not just from this book, he should write his Senator and get the following factual 160 page testimony and then he can repeal his bogus words and review: <br />U.S. Chemical and Biological Warfare-Related Dual Use Exports to Iraq and Their Possible Impact on the Health Consequences of the Persian Gulf War.  A report of Chairman Donald Riegle, and Ranking Member Alfonse D'Amato, United States Senate, May 25, 1994.<br />In fact, please send me another copy for one of my disabled friends so that I can give it to him for his pending lawsuit.<br />By the way, if any of you are concerned, the Veteran's Administration and their hospitals have done a lot of really excellent work with sick veterans and does not believe the released Army and CIA reports from the war.  Go see them if you need any help and don't take no for an answer.<br />By the way Mr. Columbus, the Army is paying me one hell of a lot of money for the rest of my life for what happened.  Unfortunately that is the only Admission they will ever make of what really happened over there and YOU end up paying for it.	2000-10-21

What emerges from this discussion is that this hypothesis is unlikely, based on counterproofs from different angles and disciplines:<br />1. There was no evidence that chimpanzee kidneys were used for preparation of the vaccine. 'Eyewitness proof' put forward by Hooper is subjective and can easily be dismissed as interview bias. Having invested so much time in preparing this book, it is easy to suspect that Hooper has a vested interest in protecting this hypothesis. In any case, several lots of these vaccines were tested to be NEGATIVE for SIV contamination, and were shown to be made from monkey, not chimpanzee, cells.<br />2. The ecological association purported in this book, suggesting that early AIDS cases came from sites where vaccinations were done, is misleading. One village turned out to be misspelled. Moreover, these areas are alongside major routes of trade, and hence could facilitate the spread of the early epidemic. The epidemiologic correlations cannot be verified statistically due to the lack of a control population, and the very low number of cases. The cohort presented by Hooper is weak to conclude any epidemiologic causality.<br />3. Chimpanzees used for testing the vaccine came from an area where the schweinfurthii subspecies abound. HIV-1 Group M, N and O are most closely related to SIV from the troglodytes subspecies, found in west-central Africa. The earliest case of HIV-1 documented in 1959 was in Kinshasa, which is close to the troglodytes range via operative ferry routes from Brazzaville.  To date, Kinshasa has the highest diversity of HIV-1 Group M viruses ever documented, with all the subtypes present (except B), suggesting that it is the site of the early epidemic.<br />4. Phylogenetic analyses using supercomputers extrapolate that HIV-1 Group M began to diversify around the 1930s. A key element here is the 1959 sample which Hooper ironically helped identify.  Sequences from this sample branch before the split of subtypes B, D and F, suggesting that the ancestor of all the subtypes (10 in all) was present far before 1959. The diversity of HIV-1 isolates in Kinshasa also reveal a less subtype structure, suggesting that the diversification occurred there, and that evolution from a single common ancestor, rather than multiple introductions of the different strains, have occurred.<br />5. Reconstruction of the method for poliovaccine preparation (washing, trypnization and freeze/thawing) using infected kidneys from SIV-infected macaques revealed that the infectivity of viruses is reduced 10^13 (e.g., 10-trillion)-fold. Hence, no virus could have survived the vaccine manufacturing process.<br />Combining all these arguments, the chain-of-evidence presented in this book is severely weakened. Overall, Hooper has presented a spectacular hypothesis fit for a media frenzy. Unfortunately, this may affect efforts to control polio eradication in the globe. Based on the presented evidence, this hypothesis NEEDS to be put to rest. Much work has to be done. The origin of AIDS remains to be solved.hat it is the site of the early epidemic. <br />4.

Its primary weakness is the lack of data to duplicate the ample examples provided in the book.  The book directs the reader to a web site for download of data.  However, the data sets at the web site have changed and the results presented in the book cannot be verified or used for practice (e.g., the &quot;bodyfat&quot; data set is now &quot;fat&quot; and the data has changed).

During the last ice age, the fall in global sea levels cut the Black Sea off from the Mediterranean. With evaporation exceeding inflows, the level of the lake fell by perhaps as much as 500 feet. Fed by glacial melt water, overtime the Black Sea became a fresh water lake. Then some 7,500 years ago as global sea levels rose following the end of the ice age, the Mediterranean again breached the Bosporus Strait, and salt water poured into the fresh water lake, killing all life and raising the sea level to its current mark. The bulk of the flooding took place in a matter of weeks. If this were the whole story, it would be interesting enough, but Ryan and Pitman push it further. They argue that 7,500 years ago Neolithic farming communities that spoke the proto Indo-European language inhabited the Black Sea region. The rapid flood triggered mass migrations of early Indo-European farmers out of the region and gave birth to the flood myths found not only in the Bible, but also in many other cultures where flood myths pre-date the Old Testament version such as the Gilgamesh epic. If Ryan and Pitman are correct, the Black Sea may turn out to be the long sort for homeland of the Indo-European language <br />The first part of this story is now well-verified scientific fact. The second part is much more speculative, but it is speculation that is consistent not only with the flood mythology, but also significant archeological, linguistic, and genetic evidence. Ryan and Pitman do a wonderful job of documenting the mass of evidence is a manner that is engaging and accessible to the lay reader. The book opens with the discovery of pre-Biblical flood myths in the 1830s and proceeds in a temporal fashion through the gradual accumulation of evidence that ultimately, provides overwhelming support for the Black Sea flood hypothesis. At the end of the book, which was written in 1997, Ryan and Pitman state that their more speculative migration and myth hypotheses would be strengthened if evidence could be found of Neolithic farming communities on the sea floor of the Black Sea. That evidence is now at hand. In September 2000, Robert Ballard, famed as the discoverer of the Titanic, found the first evidence of well-preserved structures 300 feet below the current level of the Black Sea. With more evidence likely to follow, this book is a must read for anyone interested in the history of the ancient world and its relevance to our civilization.	2000-10-06

As far as the editorial errors go, well, I'll just assume that was the publisher's fault, but the rest? <br />But the truth is, I do believe they're onto something. I've successfully incorporated many of their suggestions into my own lifestyle after long years of low-fat, high carb eating. And although I do try, at this point in my life its VERY difficult for me to get nine hours of uninterrupted pitch-dark sleep from September to April.<br />I bought and read this book shortly after it came out earlier this year. I've tried a number of times to find out anything else about these authors, but have come up with almost nothing. While a fair number of people are reading the book, it appears to have gotten almost no attention past initial reviews shortly after it was published. This is frustrating since I would like nothing better than to see their ideas verified--or at least challenged. ...	2000-09-28

But why? It is not particularly well-written, contains some poor English and doesn't answer questions it poses early on. As a popular science book, it compares unfavourably with those of Paul Davies and, as far as the subject matter is concerned, &quot;The Primeval Universe&quot; by Jayant Narlikar covers the material much more lucidly. So what is special about this book? For some reason, which is not identifiable immediately, Hawking has become almost a cult figure. This is surprising since he works in a highly abstract area of physics which is not readily understandable to the layperson, except, possibly, as science fiction. It is also true that Hawking has been portrayed as the greatest British scientist since Newton. But is this true? Unlike the theories of Newton, those of Hawking have not been verified as yet. However, criticism of these theories is, on occasion, stifled. A case in point is provided by the Bekenstein-Hawking expression for the entropy of a black hole. A major objection to this is that it violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Papers raising this have appeared in the scientific literature and none has been challenged. However, articles have been rejected for publication purely on the grounds that the end result disagreed with Hawking. This is puzzling but it may lead some to feel that Hawking has achieved a status in popular culture which has influenced his scientific standing. If this is so, it is certainly not his fault but it is not a healthy position for science. In the end, though, the fact remains that this book is a real publishing phenomenon but not one which is justified by its contents.	2000-09-27
US	52767127	RG0GGKOH8NL8E	0521640180	280807786	Genius Explained	Books	1	8	29	N	Y	Scientistic psychobabble	The project of Michael J.A. Howe's 1999 Genius Explained is an extremely worthy one: to explicate the origins and characteristics of that special class of persons commonly denoted genius through the significance of their intellectual achievements and the lasting impression which they make on our lives and civilisation. Unfortunately, in this aggregation of logical non sequiturs, Howe brings us no closer to an understanding of the nature of genius. Howe's methodology is examined in the introduction, in which he asserts that rather than having to rely on magical or miraculous explanations for genius, we can see the explication of the phenomenon of genius as a problem which can be solved. Specifically, the solution to explaining the seemingly astonishing capabilities of some people is directly attributable to circumstances which nurtured them (home environments, learning opportunities, etc). He goes on to point out that through extraordinary diligence and application over a period of years, generally though not exclusively in the formative years of their early childhoods, these geniuses became exceptionally proficient in their areas of study. Due to this, Howe suggests, geniuses need not be born but can be readily explained as products of a certain set of environmental factors. His thesis further suggests that an exploration of the well-documented childhood of certain geniuses will reveal that they did indeed enter into protracted periods of training before contributing in the ways which would later mark them as geniuses, rather than emerging as full armed intellectual giants. Chapters 2-5 examine the childhoods of Charles Darwin, George Stephenson and Michael Faraday. Chapters 5 and 6 broadly explore the phenomenon of the child prodigy. Chapter 7 leaves the world of scientist and shows that the Bront? children and Mary Evans experienced similar and lengthy periods of experimentation with fiction as children before 'arriving' at their first major novels, many of which contain threads of thought from their juvenilia. Chapter 8 examines the person of the inventor and Chapter 9 casts an eye over the idea that talent is inborn. The theme of scientific 'explanation' is a heavy and destructive one in this book and at no time does Howe countenance any other explanation of genius than a 'scientific' one. Howe naively relies on the limited conception that 'science explains everything'. A passage in the introduction reveals how perilous this position is: Howe offers it is more reasonable to believe the skilled conjurors who can imitate his feats rather than Uri Geller's explanation that he uses his mind to bend spoons. This is of course the more reasonable explanation if you believe the pat explanations of scientific 'observation'; but I do not, as a matter of course, happen to believe them myself and nor do I necessarily suppose that Geller's explanation is invalidated because of the existence of the scientific explanation. It would take more that this flimsy argument to show that. The scientific explanation only shows that the action is replicable by means other than the powers of one's mind. A far more serious problem besets Howe's project: nowhere does he explain what a genius is or even what it might be, problems that might have been addressed had he investigated the existing philosophical standpoints on this issue. I for one do not believe in the concept of human genius (although I do not rule out divine genius) and neither do I believe that any of Darwin, Mozart, Faraday, Elliott, Stephenson, or any of the other examined in this book are geniuses. I further think that all Howe does is to demonstrate how facile or capable (a topic never canvassed by Howe) certain individuals were in certain areas of expertise: are human calculators like George Bidder geniuses for being able to multiply six-digit numbers rapidly; or is Mozart a genius for being able to notate the incredibly repetitive Allegri Miserere, an unverified achievement? The suggestion is offensive. A genius, if it existed, would simultaneously be the most excellent in all fields of endeavour; the suggestions offered by Howe merely touch genius or reflect a fraction of its total. Richard Burton's considerable achievements in several fields are dismissed early in the book for being so diffuse as not to attract the title of genius, and yet as far as I am concerned, Burton is the most genius-like case offered in this book. With a true genius, there would be no question of facility. A genius would not be good at any thing, but merely unsurpassed in all things. All variations of this all-encompassing position merely indicate varying levels of facility. Finally, a word on the historical perspective which dominates this book. I see genius as a outgrowth of the late eighteenth century which received considerable exposure particularly in musical circles in the nineteenth century and which unfortunately continues to plague us today. Howe's book is firmly in the thrall of nineteenth century polemics. It is not surprising that he must rely on nineteenth century accounts of the childhoods of his heroes; earlier centuries did not seem to credit childhood with the significance we are now accustomed to giving it. His claim that Bach and Handel were regarded as prodigies is anachronistic and unsupportable to a large extent. Tales of Handel's amazing the court of Saxe-Weissenfels with his organ playing date from Mainwaring's attempts after the composer's death to canonize him and stand firmly in the nascent tradition of the genius. Darwin, Stephenson and Faraday's contemporary biographies stand either in the tradition of the hagiography or the self-improvement story (this is the age that produced The Improvement of the Mind, after all). Everything in this book is necessarily read backwards. A history suggests nothing of itself: we suggest to it. Biography in fact may or may not show something with regard to facility in a certain area, but if offers nothing in terms of being a genius. A disappointing book. It is time for a serious study to enter this field and put to rest the psuedo-scientific musings and comfortable certain explanations which the scientific establishment offers.uggestion is offensive.

Like everything else about Gore, this reality clashes with the public myth of the hard-working, pig shit-shoveling, mule team-plowing farm boy from Carthage, Tennessee.<br />Authors Cockburn and St. Clair's excellent dissection of Gore's public myth is a must read for any progressive - especially those who continue to bleat the fear-inflating nonsense that the wagons must be circled around Gore as George W. Bush is an oil-drenched, military thrall out to roll back worker's rights, environmental protections and a woman's right to choose.  This, the first thorough examination of Gore's 25-year public career from a Left (or any for that matter) perspective shows that those very feared rollbacks have been the bases of the chameleon Gore's slimy rise.<br />In Al Gore: A User's Manual, we learn that Gore, himself, has been a major Defense department sycophant. After a politically-motivated short tour of Vietnam as an Army reporter complete with constant bodyguard (note to Creedence: he was a Senator's son), Gore, once in Congress (how he got there another great story) became one of the Pentagon's most trusted water carriers. The hawk Gore virtually invented the Midgetman missile, midwifed the MX missile, voted against every effort to cut the Defense budget, backed the invasion of Grenada, supported the contras and, then in what he called his &quot;finest hour,&quot; voted for the Gulf War  - only after shopping his vote on the very day of the debate to each side in order to secure the most favorable TV slot during the debate.<br />While in Congress, Al Gore was not only a hawk, but also a voice against homosexuals, whom he called &quot;deviants.&quot; Gore also preposterously claims to have always &quot;supported a woman's right to choose&quot; when, in fact, he has an 84% pro-life rating from National Right to Life, even stating that he believes in &quot;the fetus' right to life&quot; and voting for the Hyde amendment AND Rep. Mark Siljander's effort to undercut Roe v Wade.<br />The authors relate tale after tale of Gore's use of personal epiphanies to explain his beliefs.  The book exposes how Gore used the death of his sister, Nancy, from smoking-related cancer as a prop, saying in 1996, &quot;that is why until I draw my last breath, I will pour my heart and soul into the cause of protecting our children from the dangers of smoking.&quot; Seven years after her death, Gore was still on the Big Tobacco dole - accepting tobacco money and accepting government subsidies for the tobacco he still grew on his Tennessee farm. Though Al and Tipper once smoked a lot of pot, Gore now opposes its use, even for medical purposes, ignoring how his sister got relief from chemo primarily from the beneficial effects of smoking marijuana!<br />Other family events become similar props. A pedestrian/auto accident where his son, Al III, was hit on the streets of Baltimore was similarly milked for political use. After lying that his son (who fully recovered) was down in the street unconscious on the verge of death (two nurses who happened by say Al III never lost consciousness), Gore claims that it became yet another of his epiphanies and dedicated himself to being a more present dad. In the end, however, he soon sequestered himself away from Tipper and kids in his family's old hotel suite to pen &quot;Earth on the Balance.&quot;<br />It is here, in Gore's supposed reputation as an environmentalist, that his penchant for lying and double-dealing is most obvious. The man, who wrote that protection of the environment should be the &quot;organizing principle&quot; of government, in his political career, has done nothing of the sort. The authors point out that it was Green Al who first used opened the door to weakening the Nixon-signed Endangered Species Act by creating the &quot;god squad&quot; to in order to advance the Tellico Dam in his home state over concerns about the dam's effect on the Snail Darter. At the same time he was a foremost, even fanatical, proponent of the Clinch River breeder reactor.<br />In 1992, candidate Gore promised to oppose the WTI hazardous waste burner in East Liverpool, Ohio. Once elected, it became the first environmental promise, written at that, broken by the Clinton/Gore administration. Soon thereafter, Clinton and Gore came to the Pacific Northwest and forced the supine Big Greens, over the objections of local grassroots environmentalists, to drop an injunction against old growth logging that was issued by Reagan-appointee, Judge William Dwyer. Once Green Al left town, the ancient trees were again rolling down to the mills and the Northern spotted owl, the species the injunction was out to protect have now on the brink of extinction. The Gore-brokered Northwest Forest Plan calls for 50 years of continued cutting of the Ancient Forests. Not satisfied, Clinton, at Gore's urging, then, in 1995, signed the so-called &quot;Salvage Rider&quot; which delivered millions of acres to the chainsaws unfettered by any ability for citizens to challenge the destruction in court.<br />On and on it goes. Al Gore is a man of political expediency. The man who famously &quot;reinvented&quot; government, has been constantly reinventing himself. The rap that Gore is a man who will say anything to get elected is verified time after time by the authors. He has said famously that he &quot;invented the Internet.&quot; He claims that he and Tipper (who comes off quite sympathetically in the book despite her censorship efforts) were the models for Erich Segal's book, &quot;Love Story.&quot; He claims falsely to have &quot;got a bunch of people indicted and sent to jail&quot; when he unethically became part of a police sting while a reporter for the Tennessean. He claimed to have authored the earned income tax credit, which was enacted two years, before he was elected to Congress. He even claimed he did not know he was even &quot;in a Buddhist temple&quot; much less there to collect campaign cash. <br />Cockburn and St. Clair have done a service by exposing the Al Gore myth and providing the background information we'll all be looking for once the rhetoric and actions of a Gore administration, like those of the Clinton/Gore one, begin to not add up.<br />One can hope that the oily (yes, they delve deeply into the Gore family ties to Occidental petroleum and its shady head, Armand Hammer) Gore history will be looked at seriously BEFORE any vote casting, but, in the end, the fear inflation and collusion of the rudderless Democrat special interests will likely win out. Cockburn and St. Clair have earned the right to be first in line when it comes time to say, &quot;I told you so.&quot;	2000-09-27

In addition, the author's friends, in positively reviewing his work, consider fact-based and logical criticisms of it &quot;a sniping contest&quot;. So much for amateur historians and their flatterers.<br />     The FACTS about Robert Rogers and Rogers Rock exist.  The author did not touch upon the following FACTS of the battle and its aftermath, because they conflicted with his theory that tired men, after a battle on snowshoes, could not have, and would not have, retreated up Bald Mountain.  These FACTS are:<br />     1.) Rogers himself offered a sergeant to Captain Pringle and Lieutenant Roche &quot;to conduct us THRU THE MOUNTAIN&quot;, in Pringle's words. (So much for the 9/15 reviewer's contention that Rangers did not climb over mountains in wintertime &quot;during or after battles&quot;).Clearly Rogers expected his men, and himself, to escape OVER the mountain range at their backs, by whatever route offered itself.  The saddle route was the most obvious, and easiest, way; but even Pringle noted that the pursuing Indians were running in different directions to &quot;intercept&quot; those Rangers who had already begun their retreat. Do the author and his reviewer friends have any contemporary evidence that disputes this, or that can point to the ACTUAL escape routes of the survivors?<br />     2.) Cochrane's testimoy, as published by Timothy Dwight in 1802, is NOT &quot;third-hand testimony&quot;.  The reviewer of September 15 mixes up two SEPARATE pieces of information supplied to Timothy Dwight, two SEPARATE oral accounts that place both Rogers AND some of his men on the summit of Bald Mountain on the night of March 13, 1758.  The first account is related by the guide escorting Dwight on a voyage up Lake George.  The anecdote that immediately follows it was heard by Dwight from an unidentifed secondparty who, in fact, might have been &quot;Colonel Cochrane&quot; himself, considering the way it is worded.  The reviewer of 9/15 also makes the erroneous assumption that the man relating the first of these accounts &quot;was far from unbiased&quot;, forgetting that the &quot;bias&quot; in Dwight's relation of it was no doubt Dwight's own perspective on Rogers.<br />     3.) In 1760--a mere two years after the battle, what we know today as Rogers' Slide was being referred to as &quot;Rogers' Leap&quot; in the diary of a British officer.<br />     4.)  In 1766 a land patent in the area also refers to Bald Mountain itself as &quot;Rodgers' Leap&quot;.  Oddly, that same year, another petition calls it &quot;Rogers' Rock&quot;.<br />     5.)  By 1777 one American soldier travelling up the lake noted Rogers' feat of &quot;descending a part of {Bald Mt} with his Detachment&quot;, and that &quot;one would doubt the fact IF NOT SO WELL AUTHENTICATED.&quot;<br />     6.)  The reviewer of 9/15 says that the route up Bald Mt. from the saddle is &quot;neither a logical route nor an easy way to get home&quot;.  It certainly IS logical, and more attractive than the alternative, if there is no other way to &quot;get home&quot;.  The Rangers fled by individuals, or in very small parties of twos and threes, in typical Ranger fashion after such a bad defeat.  Rogers clearly mentions Indians both pursuing AND capturing some of his men---a fact verified in Pringle's contemporary account.  Can the author and his reviewer friends say with any preciseness just HOW FAR those Indians actually kept up their pursuit?  That the saddle path was already being travelled by Indians in pursuit of Rangers would indeed suggest why some Rangers, including Rogers, veered instead to the top of the mountain to find another way to escape.<br />     7.)  The reviewer of 9/15 talks about how snow deterred some 18th century travellers, but again fails to recognize that it rarely made a difference to Rangers.While the snow was indeed deep during the Battle on Sbnowshoes, conditions for Rogers and his men were much worse during Rogers' scout of March 7, 1759, in which he and his men fought a two-mile running battle with French and Indians out of Fort Carillon, across the ice of Lake Champlain, then over the deeply-snowed mountains between the south arm of the lake and the northern end of Lake George; and after repelling the enemy Rogers led his men down the ice of Lake George to warm campfires at Sabbath Day Point. It was the most excruciating of all of Rogers' winter treks---a total of fifteen miles of hard fighting, of climbing up and over snow-clad mountains, and over wind-swept lake.  Thus it dwarfed, for sheer endurance, the retreat after the Battle on Snowshoes; and in fact many Rangers, including Rogers, came down with frostbite after the agonizing experience.<br />     So much for historical facts decided around the campfires of modern reenactors.<br />     The saddest fact of all is that, with all the errors, poor research, and unsupportable contentions made in this book, it is still being defended by some as &quot;a good book...done very well&quot;. Robert Rogers indeed deseves better.	2000-09-24

I found this book to be the most complete history of Mike Hailwood's racing career I have read. The author's knowledge of his subject is encyclopedic and yet manages to be lively and interesting. Mr. Woolett illustrated his book lavishly with many photos that had not been published before. The listings of Mike's motorcycle racing career results in the back of the book will no doubt be used to settle many an argument among Mike's fans about what happened, when and where. My only criticism of the book is about this section. I was at the Canadian Motorcycle Grand Prix with Mike in 1967. It was on September 30th not September 24th as stated in the book. Memories can become confused. But,I have verified those dates with other sources. At the end of the racing on Sunday some of the factory team riders flew in a helicopter to the Toronto airport where BOAC (as it was in those days ) was holding its overnight flight to London. They flew all night and raced the next morning in the Race of the South at Brands Hatch on October 1 - not September 25th as stated in the book. As further confirmation I have Mike's trophy with the date engraved on it. These are the only dates on which I can give an opinion. I have no idea how accurate the other dates are. But, this is a minor flaw in an outstanding book. This is a wonderful tribute to a great man and his racing career. It is the perfect complement to Christopher Hilton's very personal portrait of Mike, A Man Called Mike. I am glad to see renewed interest in Mike coming just before what will be the 20th anniversary of his death, March 23, 1981 at the age of 40. But the legend lives on.	2000-09-24

Recently, Swearingen and Bluejacket descendants were subjected to DNA  testing. The conclusions: the Bluejackets and the Swearingens are NOT  genetically linked and that Marmaduke Von Swearingen once and for all was  NOT Chief Blue Jacket.

The simplicity and power of Dr. Vaughan-Lee's  writing made a deep impression on me, and I looked forward to reading more  of his writings on the subject.   In THE BOND WITH THE BELOVED, Dr.  Vaughan-Lee continues and elaborates on this Sufi tradition brought to the  West by his teacher, Irina Tweedie. This book focuses on the stages of  spiritual transformation, what the seeker can expect to encounter at each  stage, and the practices that aid the seeker in the journey. He draws from  both Sufi and Christian sources to illustrate that the mystical journey in  any tradition is basically the same. In fact, he uses the four stages of  prayer identified by St. Tereasa of Avila to illustrate what the seeker can  expect to encounter.  The practices Vaughan-Lee describes that put the  seeker into the arena of transformation are very simple. He writes,  &quot;In our Naqshbandi group meetings we meditate, drink tea and discuss  dreams. The lack of outer form or collective ritual (music or the chanting  of the dhikr) emphasizes the individual inner journey.&quot; But he also  stresses the powerful transformative effect of these simple practices -  especially the stillness of meditation. &quot;In deep states of meditation  there is absolute stillness, darkness and nothingness. . . . We Leave the  mind completely behind in order to enter the uncreated, dark light of  God.&quot; He writes like someone who has been there.  Though the  methods Dr. Vaughan-Lee describes seem so simple, they were verified for me  by the work of the renowned Jungian analyst, Marie-Louise von Franz, in her  book, THE WAY OF THE DREAM. Her description of dreamwork, which she says  she used almost exclusively with her patients, echoes the dreamwork and  transformation that Vaughan-Lee describes in THE BOND WITH THE BELOVED.  Another book that corroborates Jungian theory and Sufism is J. Marvin  Spiegelman's SUFISM, ISLAM, AND JUNGIAN PSYCHOLOGY. All three books are  excellent material on the inner dynamics of spiritual/psychological  transformation.  BOND WITH THE BELOVED. TABLE OF CONTENTS.

The breath of her vocabulary  impresses me a lot and her style recalls in me the fascination I  encountered reading exotic adventure fictions in my youth.<br /> The story  develops on a background of contemporary events that concern us all.   Protagonists and dialogs are superbly painted.<br /> &quot;The Key to  Paradise&quot;, that makes us travel all over the world, is the occasion  for Christiane des Sagettes and through the character of Diana, the  heroine, to present her very own platform as she actually, herself, entered  the 1981 presidential campaign in France, as a pacifist and defender of  women's equal rights.<br /> Her platform reveals, on the one hand, an  infinitely touching plea against the destructive and murderous insanity of  men and, on the other, an urgent prayer for the union of women beyond  borders --the name of the association she created in France in real life;  women who, according to her views, are the only ones to be able to offer  the children of the world peace and happiness, that men have been unable to  accomplish in the course of centuries. With much humour and realism, the  account  of her electoral campaign shows us the hardship and opposition  that women face in the political world.<br /> Christiane des Sagettes is  very well-acquainted with the Middle East and its customs and gives us a  lively account of its exotic sites, full of passion and accuracy.

US	49431700	R34X8OK09IE1D5	0375503994	196227364	Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush	Books	4	35	37	N	N	A book that could be better can still be good	Having read these reviews well after I read the book, I have had a chance to look at some of the claims. <br />To the criticism that the book makes  challenging or verifying their facts difficult, this is somewhat true. I  checked out several statistics, especially the ones on the environment.  Most I found easily verified. I took the anonymous sources with a grain of  salt. However, to say this book is without facts, without support, is  willful misreading. <br />Living in Dallas, I've watched the corporate media  at work, and it's hardly a myth. The Belo Corporation is unabashedly  pro-Bush:<br />+ Reports on Bush are extremely favorable. (In one week of  watching channel 8 evening news, I counted 8 Bush stories to 1 Gary Mauro  story during the recent governor's race.)<br />+ For many months, the Dallas  News website had links to the Bush campaign site. They did not provide  links to opponents' sites. <br />Sometimes, contrary opinions do make their  way out of the Belo media outlets. But the overwhelming presentation from  Belo (which owns several Texas newspapers--including the Dallas Morning  News--, the Texas Cable News network, and television stations) is that Bush  should be president. Consider too the Center for Media &amp; Public Affairs  analysis: Bush has been treated more often and more favorably by the news  media than Gore. <br />It's in this environment that this book is refreshing.  It's an approachable examination of recorded actions and outcomes, not  &quot;talking head&quot; summaries of sound bites and propaganda that pass  for political analysis. It should also make voters, particularly  conservatives who have criticized Clinton and who favor smaller government,  realize that this man's actions rarely support his promises and claims and  often resemble what these voters dislike. <br />Could the book have better  considered opposing arguments? Most certainly. Is it as amusing other  Ivins's books? No. However, it clearly establishes its purposeand method:  to judge a politician by his/her actions. This idea is reminiscent of  Theodore White's _Making of a President_, that one could see in   candidate's mundane behavior a forecast of presidential activity. And given  the paucity of public service from Bush, the authors are sometimes forced  to inspect less than weighty matters, but they do so to provide an insight  into Bush's character. More than anything else, Bush has been a champion  for unbridled business: <br />+ Use city government--not the free market--to  get what you want at the price you want.<br />+ Allow companies to pollute and  minimize their accountability.<br />+ Reduce the threat of lawsuits against  companies by limiting the legal abilities of citizens and consumers.<br />It  is a compelling, informative read.	2000-08-25

You need a book like &quot;guerilla credit&quot; exactly because of people like DFC (a banker -  little wonder) who believes that everyone with bad credit is a loser who  simply needs to pay his/her bills.  Well, I have news for you DFC, this  book is extremely helpful for those of us who are the victims of credit  reporting agencies who couldn't care less about the accuracy of the  information they are reporting. <br />I am one of the many people who, at 30  years old, had never requested copies of my credit reports, and who thought  I had perfect credit prior to inexplicably being turned down for a loan.   Much to my horror, I found out that there were more than 40 errors in my  credit reports.  Dozens of accounts that had been closed for many years  were still reflecting as open, students loans erroneously reflecting  defaults, credit card accounts erroneously reflecting 30 and 60 day late  payments.  All false information.  Using Todd's book, ALL of this false  information has now been removed from my reports.  Moreover, this book will  teach you how to get results when the reporting agencies play their little  games of &quot;verifying&quot; erroneous information.  I can't tell you how  many times my reports came back with &quot;information verified&quot; even  though I had enclosed written documentation that the information being  reported was not correct (it really is unbelievable isn't it!)  Berman  explained how to be persistent, get aggressive, and fight these unethical  reporting companies and their shoddy work practices.  <br />Even if you  legitimately have creditors knocking on your door, this book will give you  some very helpful advise as to negotiating a partial payment in return for  a promise not to report the negative information to a credit bureau (DFC  doesn't want you to know that).  And the book will also tell you how you  MAY be able to get some accurate (but old) information removed from your  report.<br />Finally, the credit reporting agencies try very hard to make your  report as cryptic as possible in an effort to prevent you from  understanding exactly what they are reporting about you.  Todd's book shows  you how to read your report - a very important first step.  However, I must  add that because the book is now 6 years old, and because the agencies keep  changing the form of their reports (gee, I wonder why?), this is the book's  biggest downfall right now (and the ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars).   PLEASE Todd if you're reading this, revise your book and publish a new  edition!   <br />Notwithstanding this one downfall, I still HIGHLY recommend  this book.	2000-08-25

Covers the collective history of France, the German kingdoms,  Britain, Spain, Syria, and Italy.<br />Although the author points out that it  is a history of &quot;feudal&quot; Europe, he seems to focus on how much  wasn't feudal in the period.  It seems as if not one chapter goes by where  he doesn't mention the fact that the system in place was similar to  feudalism, but was in fact not it.<br />There is also constant mention of how  many of the facts of the period can go unverified, and how it is impossible  to determine the exact numbers in battles, seiges, etc.  I understand the  fact and it's valid, but brining it up every dozen pages does get a bit  old.<br />All in all, I think it was a good book for someone interested in a  general history of the different feudal and pseudo-feudal systems on Europe  during 700-1200AD.  It also contains interesting bits of military and  political history alongside it, which is very appealing.	2000-08-23

This review compares the Rough Guides Portugal (9th ed.) with Lonely Planet Portugal (2nd ed.).<br />We just returned from 2.5 weeks in Portugal. This was our  first trip to Portugal and we took and used extensively the Portugal books  from Lonely Planet and Rough Guide. We didn't visit the Algarve or  Alentejo, concentrating on Lisbon and north.<br />Both books were good, but  overall we preferred the Rough Guide book. It was better organized and more  up to date. It's writing was more incisive, lively, and witty.<br />Here are  some details as I saw them:<br />LP maps often covered a wider area and had  more detail than the RG maps, but they were in smaller type and often  difficult to read. On more than one occassion a cab driver pulled out his  spectacles to read the LP map.<br />Rough Guide had more up to date phone  numbers. LP did not have the up to date area codes (the leading 0 has been  changed to a 2). In addition, for many properties in the north they had a 5  digit phone number, when now they are all six. More disturbingly, they have  no update on their website for either the corrected area code or phone  numbers. In fact, there was no Portugal update to the guide at all. (I'm  not talking of the 'unverified travelers' reports.)<br />LP provided more  detailed information about the nitty-gritty details of traveling, e.g.,  money, trains, internet access, etc.<br />RG presented the towns around Aveiro  better. It was through it that we learned of Sao Jacinto, Torreira, and so  on. These were not indexed in LP. We didn't discover that LP had some  information on them until much later because it was more hidden in the  Aveiro section. Since we had already decided to not stay in Aveiro we  didn't think to look there. Although they were also in the Aveiro section  of RG, they had their own headings and were also indexed.<br />Similarly, RG  highlighted Belmonte in the mountains. This town was interesting in itself  and also in that it now holds one of Portugal's largest remaining Jewish  communities and its new synogogue. Jews had previously worshipped secretly  in a town house until 1974, now replaced by the new building. (I'm writing  this using a mouse pad I purchased at the Belmonte castle for $1.50 with  images of columns from the Mosteiro da Batalha!)<br />I also preferred RG's  treatment of Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela and of Parque Natural de  Montesinho.<br />We used several recommendations for restaurants and  accommodations from the books. Their batting averages were about the same:  good but not great. One African dance club listed in both books was now a  female stip place, as my wife discovered when seeing if the cab had taken  us to the right address. (I was waiting in the cab.) I felt they were  generally too generous in their evaluation of hotels and  restaurants.<br />Both books had several failings common to them and to other  guide books that we've used.<br />Nearly all the accommodations and  restaurants are in tourist areas. We were fortunate to stay in Lisbon in a  residential district. It was comforting to leave in the morning and not be  surrounded by hordes of fellow tourists. Similarly, we were the only  obvious tourists in the local restaurants, some of which were excellent.  Nor were we out in the sticks where a car was required. We were right off  the #28 tram line, recommended as the best tram to ride simply for riding  it in both books.<br />Several other times during the trip we stayed and ate  outside the centro area. In some cases a car would have been needed, but we  were only several km out of center. In any case, I think both books should  offer more 'out of centro' possibilities, especially when transportation is  available.<br />LP is out front in saying that its reviewers do not stay at  all the hotels or eat at all the restaurants they list.  I would like it if  the reviews would be initialized with the reviewers initials for the ones  that they personally tried.  This would also allow us to see and evaluate  each reviewer's tastes and standards as our trip progressed, not to mention  to see which places they really tried.  One LP writer (not an author of this book) in discussing  restaurants wrote: &quot;As one of those LP writers I can tell you that it  is not physically possible to eat even a 'little bit of a meal' in each of  those restaurants :-) What we all tend to do is eat at a broad  cross-section within the norms of natural eating times and visit the other  restaurants and talk to the owner or even the diners if it can be done  discretely. In the same vein we don't sleep at every hotel!&quot;<br />Talk to  the owners!  Now there's something for an unbiased, disinterested  evaluation! <br />Both books are oriented to train travelers, but they should  have some more info on driving too, which is not expensive. For example,  neither had a mileage chart between major cities and, more importantly,  neither had a chart of expected driving times. Using the 'N' roads which  look like major highways can take quite a bit of time because they are  mostly two lane roads, often twisty and hilly, and can have a lot of SLOW  truck traffic. You'd probably be better off driving on the back roads, both  for time and scenery, and for that small village, local feel. But you'd  never know it from these books. This complaint isn't restricted to just LP  and RG, of course.<br />In addition, both books were quite short on history,  culture and demographics. How religious are the Portuguese? (We were asked  on several occassions whether we were 'religioso'.) What is the median and  mean income of each of the areas (even of Portugal as a whole) and how does  this compare to the rest of western Europe. What are contemporary  middle-class Portuguese characteristics?<br />It wouldn't have taken more than  an additional 10 or 15 pages for such information, and it would have made  our trip more meaningful.<br />In sum, again, both guides were good withroom  for improvement, with our preferring the Rough Guide overall.	2000-08-23
US	43567428	R2WKZW5BGN9BHC	0312450109	301591247	Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason	Books	5	11	18	N	N	The Pinnacle. A Do or Die for any Philosopher .	You can evidently tell from the title of my review that I liked the book. The Critique of Pure reason is a pretty important work screaming to be read by any curious person. The reason I like the book is because it is one of, if not the 1st book, to address the concept of human cognition. In this context, Kant discusses the possible, the necessary, time, and a few other very significant details of our human, corporeal existence. Yes the book is long and tedious but shows Kant's genius in developing a framework of human cognition (previously called 'the understanding' by some classical writers). If Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason' doesn't begin to demonstrate, objectively, how the clever cognitve apparatus known as the brain weaves its fantastical web, then you were reading it upside down.<br />Among the many ideas put forward in this opus what stood out as the main thesis to me was the distinction between a real idea and a transcendental one; hence Kant's transcendental idealism. Humans have ideas of course, we have experiences, this is how we live in this world, by our ideas and experiences. Other thinkers, like Locke, would have our ideas be the results of our experiences. Not quite sayeth Kant. Some ideas are completely exclusive of experience. These are the tranascendental ideas, ideas that transcend experience. They're really not worth much, they might be, you can't (no pun intended) tell. Although transcendental ideas can arise independently of experience, they can only be verified by experience. Such an idea, the distinction between ideas proper and transcendental ones is the key idea here. The ultimate verification of either type of idea by some experience is why Kant is known as the father of the scientific method. Verifying ideas by experience is another term for what we now call experimentation. Not that Kant invented experimentation, but that he codified it (well really others did too, like Francis Bacon, but Kant gets the laurel).<br />Ideas help us to interpret the world, transcendental ones are apt to lead us off on paths we don't really want to go down, and for good reason. Cognitively, we might deduce far into the future and conclude that events meet somehwere up there on the horizon. Or we could reverse this process, looking back into the past, like we do with the 'big bang' concept. From where we are in the present, looking far into the future or far into the past, what we appear to see may look like a unity. Well maybe and maybe not. The meeting of events way off up or back there are simply impossible to confirm by experience. In such a case we are left to rely on circumstantial evidence, as with the big bang. For example, there is no overwhelming evidence that what astronomers call the universe actually represents the universe as it is. There are bits of evidence, like ubiquitous microwave background radiation and predominant red-shifting, but the idea of what the universe is in actuality is a transcendental idea; there is simply no empirical way to confirm the existence of such a thing as the universe. Within such cognitive phenomena Kant is our sage.<br />What is really true or false in this world? If you still think the idea of objective reality is feasible then this treatise by the father of the scientific method must not be missed. Don't be fooled by the ethical implorings of Kant's 'The Critique of Practical Reason.' That's an entirely different book. 'The Critique of Pure Reason' is an atheist's dream. After Kant thoroughly exposes the idea of the absolute being as transcendental pish-posh, he does attempt to backpedal some by imploring the faithful to remain vigilant, but too late; he has already pounded the stake into the withering heart of a deity who Nietzsche [my paraphrase] would later lament the passing of. One can never hope to aspire to even a modicum of philosophical being, indeed it's hard to imagine even beginning to think critically, til they've read this work. Buy it, suffer through it(then read Schopenhauer), and maybe, just maybe, you'll have a chance.	2000-08-19

PERFECT, is better than SON OF THE MORNING, NOW YOU SEE HER, and KILL  AND TELL, but it definitely isn't worth the price of one movie ticket, much  less three (roughly $25)!<br />It was extremely easy to spot the killer.  This  wasn't simply a lucky guess.  I had the killer pegged to a tee,  second-guessing everything that made him tick.  What made this so easy was  the extensive development of the killer's public identity, an otherwise  negligible secondary character.  Two or three other possible suspects were  mentioned, but no more than mentioned.  There wasn't a credible motive  among the red herrings.<br />The only questions I had concerning the identity  of the killer were questions of credibility.  Is it likely that this person  received a high school and college education despite a complete psychiatric  breakdown during the formative years?  Is it likely that a mere telephone  call to the killer's psychiatrist to inform her of the killer's death would  have yielded Sam everything he ever wanted to know about the killer's  psychiatric background and the therapeutic treatment he received? (Come on!   Sam should have at least had to present a death certificate and wait for  it to be verified.)<br />There were some genuinely entertaining moments in  this novel, but not nearly enough exploration of the relationship between  the hero and heroine.  Everything was rushed, and the protagonists were  kept apart for a good part of the book (such as when Sam takes off for an  out-of-town business trip right after the first romantic encounter, with  not even a fare-thee-well to Jaine).<br />This novel was more of an exercise  in female-bonding between the four friends, and not a romance between the  hero and heroine, and definitely not a compelling &quot;whodunnit.&quot;   If you want a great romance and a compelling piece of suspense (albeit not  a &quot;whodunnit&quot;), go check out DREAM MAN.  In the meantime, if you  must read MR. PERFECT, sign up on your local library's wait-list.	2000-08-16

It was called back  then &quot;States Rights&quot; and &quot;Constitutional Rights&quot;. Since  then I have read many period newspaper accounts, diaries, reports, and  books covering 1850-1870. Some years back I had already come to the  conclusion that the war was over Constitution and taxes. Mister Adams's  book condenses much of what I have read over the years into 1 or 2 evenings  reading. Though missing some documentation as in local newspaper articles  to show the South's frustration over the taxes before the war. Most points  raised and documentation are certainly adequate. If one wants to tear apart  his work I suppose he can try. However, most references are easily  verified.<br />A must read for anyone truly interested in history, and  Constitution. Captain Ashe's book would be another early account drawing  much the same conclusions as Mister Adams. Some nice illustrations from  around the world in Mister Adams book as well.	2000-08-08

Nor was it like working at a quiet  community college.<br />&quot;Long periods of research and tedium, punctuated  by occasional moments of stark terror.&quot;<br />That's how Quentin T. Wells,  director of program innovation at Salt Lake Community College, describes  his brief career with the CIA.<br />Three decades after his four-year-stint as  a covert officer assigned to Soviet Bloc Operations, Wells has written a  novel. &quot;Final Payment&quot; is a story of international intrigue and  romance set in the early 1970s in Israel and Paraguay.<br />&quot;It's based  on two cases I knew of in the agency,&quot; Wells said. &quot;It's  information that, to my knowledge, has never appeared in the media  before.&quot;<br />Wells, who oversees the production of Web classes and  telecourses for SLCC, is a bookish man who speaks without bravado -- or  much detail -- about his life as a spy.<br />&quot;It's a dog's life for a  family,&quot; he said.<br />A Utah native, Wells joined the CIA while he was a  student at the University of Utah.<br />At the height of the Cold War,  &quot;the CIA maintained contact on many university campuses,&quot; he  said, looking for suitable recruits.<br />&quot;To work in Soviet Bloc  Operations, you had to be married,&quot; Wells said. &quot;They wanted you  to have somebody you could trust -- and they didn't want her to be  Russian.&quot;<br />Wells and his wife had no children at the time, and the  job in Washington, D.C., seemed inviting. &quot;It looked like a great  adventure,&quot; he said.<br />Wells had a standard CIA cover. To friends and  neighbors, he was a civilian employee of the U.S. Army, working in  personnel research and assessment.<br />&quot;There was an office on 2nd and R  Street, not far from where the Roosevelt Memorial is now, a fenced complex  where those of us with covers said we worked,&quot; Wells explained. There,  a CIA employee answered the phone and verified Wells' cover story to  whoever inquired.<br />Wells said the toughest part of his job was learning to  lie. &quot;Wherever I went, whether it was applying for a loan or buying  life insurance, I had to tell this story about what I did for a  living,&quot; he said. &quot;You just wrote down the information and hoped  it would always check out.&quot;<br />It always did -- although there were a  few close calls. &quot;I remember bumping into a professor I'd had at the  U. once,&quot; Wells said. &quot;He was in Washington, and I saw him at  this meeting and didn't have a chance to say anything to him alone.&quot;  In front of a group of people, he leaned over the table and asked Wells how  things were going at &quot;that secret agency.&quot; Wells didn't miss a  beat. &quot;A lot of folks think . . . (the Army) is pretty secretive, but  we're much more open than that,&quot; he said.<br />It seemed to work. Wells  said his professor got the hint, and no one else at the gathering seemed  suspicious.<br />Wells won't say what countries he visited as an employee of  the CIA.<br />&quot;None, officially,&quot; he said. &quot;If you checked, I  never had a passport in those years.&quot;<br />He did rub shoulders with  Aldrich Ames, the CIA officer turned Soviet spy who was arrested in  1994.<br />&quot;We roomed together and trained together. He was my  partner,&quot; Wells said.<br />Ames' arrest &quot;stunned&quot; Wells at  first. &quot;But thinking back on it, it was really only surprising that he  got away with it for so long,&quot; he said.<br />There were plenty of reasons  to be suspicious, Wells said. &quot;I was in his home about a year before  he was picked up, and I remember looking at his (car) and his big home in  Arlington and thinking (the CIA) must be paying a lot better than when I  was here.&quot;<br />After he'd spent four years as a CIA officer, Wells' wife  gave birth to their first child, and it seemed like time to come back to  Utah.<br />&quot;I knew the hardest thing I'd have to do would be to lie to my  children,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd either have to lie or teach them to lie.  I understand why it has to be done, and I have respect for the families who  make that choice. But it's something I didn't want to do.&quot;<br />Wells  found a job as an advertising executive (&quot;There's not much call for  spies in Utah&quot;), and became familiar with film processing.<br />He worked  in film production for 20 years before being hired by SLCC.<br />&quot; 'Final  Payment' was actually a screenplay I wrote in the early 1970s,&quot; Wells  said. &quot;I've been writing throughout almost my entire career. But  fiction is quite different. You make your own world -- within the  constraints of reality, of course.&quot;<br />And so far, Wells said, the CIA  doesn't seem to care about his writing endeavors.<br />&quot;I'm not worried,  not after this long,&quot; he said. &quot;My information is dated enough,  it wouldn't do any harm.&quot;<br />Wells is already working on another spy  novel as well as a historical biography.<br />E-MAIL: mtitze@desnews.com<br />©  2000 Deseret News Publishing Co.	2000-08-08

In the sales pitch made by the publishers of &quot;The Buchenwald Report&quot; on that book's jacket, a big deal is made out of the fact that most of the contents of that publicaton are &quot;eyewitness accounts&quot;  given by some of the survivors shortly after their liberation at which time  &quot;they were still behind the barbed wire that had held them for so many  years&quot;.<br />However, instead of being a plus, that particular aspect of  &quot;The Buchenwald Report&quot; is its greatest flaw considering that it  has been my experience, during my 31 years of research about Buchenwald,  that the accuracy of any report based too soon after the fact is seldom  reliable since, at that time, most of the official documentation is not yet  available and, by the same token, many of the details have not yet been  verified and authenticated.<br />Furthermore, personal accounts should always  be considered as being at least somewhat suspicious and concentration camp  survivors' statements should be found particularly questionable since,  several days or even months after their liberation, these former inmates  had not yet regained all the mental faculties of normal and healthy human  beings and many of them suffered from hallucinations, delusions and at  least partial memory loss.<br />Except for David A. Hackett's introduction...  which, incidentally, is loaded with errors and inaccuracies starting with  four of them on Page 1... &quot;The Buchenwald Report&quot; is exclusively  based on personal accounts made 50 years prior to the book's publication  and, after the original report was dug up from wherever it had been buried  for half-a-century, it was translated and, without any further research or  at least some verification of the facts, dates, numbers, etc.,was published  with warts and all.<br />The number of discrepancies which I have found is  unbelievable... not only in the &quot;Main Report&quot; (Pages 27 through  104) and the &quot;Individual Reports&quot; (Pages 109 through 374) but  also in David A. Hackett's &quot;Introduction&quot; (Pages 1 through 24)  and in his footnotes which, in fact, contain a proportionally greater  number of inaccuracies than the rest of the book... a situation which  clearly indicates that the research made by David A. Hackett was rather  cursory and shallow.<br />There are also several contradictions such as, for  instance, Hackett's statement which appears on Page 5 and according to  which &quot;the courageous actions of the prisoner militia on the afternoon  of April 11 would eventually lead to the postwar myth of the prisoners'  'self-liberation of Buchenwald&quot; and his additional comment... in the  very same paragraph... that &quot;there is of course some truth to this  legend; the prisoners' actions are well documented&quot;.<br />In  contradicting himself in the same paragraph, David A. Hackett does not seem  to know if he is coming or going and, needless to say, his readers must  have been utterly confused when they read the above gibberish.<br />The  self-liberation of Buchenwald is indeed &quot;well documented&quot; and, if  Hackett had taken the trouble of going through the G-2 and G-3 journals of  the units of the U.S. Army which were in the Buchenwald area on April 11  and 12, 1945, he would have found numerous confirmations to the effect that  Buchenwald was indeed liberated by the 900 members of the camp's  underground organization.<br />&quot;The Buchenwald Report&quot; is therefore,  under the guise of a serious publication, a misleading book loaded with  inaccuracies, distortions and even fabrications.<br />Pierre C.T.

In the intervening years it has become a classic of its kind,a philippic, to use M.E. Bradford's term, tracing the illegitimate rise to power of Lyndon Baines Johnson. If you're politically naive, this book will grown hair on your chest. It's an unblinking, fearless portrait of Johnson's wheeling dealing and underhanded methods to achieve the power, prestige, and money he craved all his life. Haley names all the names and lays out facts and figures for the reader to make up his mind. And the reader winds up shaking his head in utter astonishment. The best part of the book is that detailing Johnson's eventual election to the U.S. Senate in a contest with former Gov. Coke Stevenson. The election was clearly Stevenson's, but through the machinations of George Parr, the notorious Duke of Duval County, the results were turned around in LBJ's favor. Investigators later found that among those voting in the primary were people who didn't live in the county anymore and people who weren't alive at all. But the results stood.(An interesting and amusing aside: when Haley ran for Texas governor in 1956, he approached Parr and said, &quot;I'm Evetts Haley. I'm running for governor, and if I win, it will be my privilege to put you in jail.&quot; Parr's reply: &quot;I believe you will.&quot; Parr, the Artful Dodger of Texas politics for years, eventually killed himself.)<br />At times the book grows tiresome, especially in the Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes scandals, where Haley turns a virtual torrent of names and numbers on the reader as to be sometimes confusing. But slog through those sections to get to the excellent chapter where LBJ wields an iron hand as Senate Majority Leader and maneuvers himself into the Vice Presidency. It is chilling.<br />Haley suffered considerable damage to his reputation as a result of this book, but he never backed down, and now time seems to be bearing out the truth of his claims, which have also been verified in such later works as the Robert Caro books. This is an indispensable lesson in this Presidential election year. Read it and weep.e bearing out the truth of his claims, which have also been verified in such later works as the Robert Caro books.

Nolan's just published book, Ripcord.  There are many perceptions of the Vietnam War and probably even more misperceptions.   Nolan gives it to you straight.  After writing nine books about the Vietnam  War, Nolan said, &quot;I have never encountered a Vietnam battle as  dramatic, tragic, convoluted, and bewildering as Ripcord.&quot;  Over a  three year period of intense research, Nolan conducted hundreds of  interviews via mail, email, telephone and in person.  Thousands of  doucments were checked in the National Archives.<br />As the brigade commander  during the seige of Ripcord, Keith and I had dozens of interchanges.  It is  common knowledge that retired general officers can recall with precise  clarity the details of events that never happened.  Nolan's rule that  &quot;facts&quot; must be verified by at least three sources probably  explains why some of my input to an early draft did not make the final  publication.  My long-winded point is that you do not have the &quot;whole  story&quot; of Ripcord, but what you do have in this superb book is true  and accurate.<br />What gives me the most genuine gratification with this book  is Keith Nolan's telling the individual  stories of 356 real soldiers!   Shocking, heartbreaking, inspiring; these stories help you to understand  the outrage of General Eisenhower when he blasted a war correspondent  saying, &quot;I get so eternally tired of the lack of understanding of what  the infantry soldier endures.....I get so fighting mad because of the  general lack of appreciation of real Heroism which is the uncomplaining  acceptance of unendurable conditions....&quot;<br />This book is not about the  Vietnam War.  It is about but one battle of four and a half months in a ten  year war by one brigade of the twenty four American brigades who fought in  Vietnam.  It is about conventional, not guerilla-conterinsurgency war.  The  enemy at Ripcord were uniformed regulars from North Vietnam that  outnumbered us at least six to one; well supported with heavy mortars,  heavy machine guns, recoiless rifles and rocket propelled grenades.<br />You  will be saddened by this book, as was I.  But you will also be filled with  absolute and total pride in the young Americans who answered their  country's call to duty and fought and bled and some died, but most  persevered in the finest traditions of the American military forces.	2000-07-31

While most historians who choose to write about one of history's great generals (Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, etc.) take a definite stance on their view of the general as a person, Fuller manages to be unbiased and  purely analytical in his description of Alexander the Great.  Instead of  being influenced in his interpretations of ancient sources by the images of  either &quot;Alexander the tyrant&quot; or &quot;Alexander the Great,&quot;  Fuller analyzes all of the major campaigns of Alexander's career and draws  conclusions based only on facts (often discounting facts which are not  verified across several ancient primary sources).  I found this book  enlightening and more than worthwhile to read.	2000-07-31

So kudos for anyone in this day and age of SUVs and cosmetic  surgery who would be a voice in the wilderness for such a wise old  idea.<br />Supported by the three-legged stool of Compassion, Attention and  Gratitude, we have hope of wiggling out from under our insatiable desires  and for once being happy and at peace.  It's a little difficult to get some  of these concepts across on tape at any reasonable depth of understanding  and I several times had the urge to grab pen and paper at the start of one  of the various enumerations.  This is one case where the audio medium may  fall short of the written word, but I found listening to the tape a second  time filled in the gaps pretty well.  Besides, it's hard to drive and  read.<br />I think someone interested in this subject will find several other  works very worthwile reading.  The first is &quot;The Miracle Of  Mindfulness&quot; by Thich Nhat Hanh, which addresses  &quot;Attentiveness&quot; as described on the tape - the art of living in  the present moment.  This concept is so important that &quot;A Course In  Miracles&quot; devotes a great deal of attention to it, referred to as the  &quot;Holy Instant&quot;.  It's hard to be unhappy when the regrets of the  past and anxiety about the future are both &quot;out of the  picture&quot;!<br />A second worthwhile investment might be  &quot;Lovingkindness - The Revolutionary Art Of Happiness&quot; by Sharon  Salzberg.  The word &quot;Lovingkindness&quot; is perhaps more appropriate  than &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; or &quot;Charity&quot; or  &quot;Compassion&quot;. In our society, we're not schooled in these  concepts and our language reflects this. Lovingkindness can be a great  source of happiness.<br />Gratitude is simply Thankfulness - something we  frequently forget makes us happy as well!<br />Despite the rather amusing  connotations that ancient spiritual concepts have been &quot;verified&quot;  by the modern sciences, this is intrinsically powerful material.	2000-07-30

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	5	31	32	N	N	helped me better understand my French friends	Full disclosure:  I myself haven't been to France.  I speak French and have close French friends, though, and have invested a good deal of reading and discussion in comprehending French ways of thought and action.<br />This  said, what I really liked about this book was that it cut to the heart of  some of the areas where my own people (United States) and the French often  don't communicate well.  Taylor, who has lived a long time in France,  explains quite credibly why it is some people find the French to be rude.  How shocking to find out that they consider *us* rude.  In any event, what  makes this book attractive is that it offers sound behavioural tips and  suggestions to break these boundaries and have a good time, always bearing  in mind that in any place some people will be rude no matter what you  do.<br />A simple example, without spoiling the book for you.  In my homeland,  the American West, a limp handshake with no eye contact (especially between  males) often causes distrust or gives actual offense.  In France, we are  told (and I have verified), to fail to greet the shopkeeper, waiter or  whomever ranks at the same level:  a slap in the face.  This is what I mean  about the book:  having read it, you would enter the little knickknack shop  and politely say 'bonjour, madame' to the proprietrix, and give her the  time of day, avoiding a pitfall you'd otherwise maybe not have known  existed.<br />I think this book should be read with an open mind.  Everything  in it that I could test on French people tested accurately.  I think it  would be a significant help for anyone who plans travel to France or who  regularly interacts with French people.	2000-07-30

Its all about taking a leap  of faith and understanding that our past is much more complex and wonderful  than we have been tought.The fact that he has a talent for Mathematics goes  a long way in both ,rationalizing his book and at the same time making it  all the more incredible.

I appreciate a concise source with as much information as possible as close as possible to the section I am studying.  The companion bible offers word  corrections in the side column, marking the alternate translations with a  small circle above the word in question.  This is barely noticable in the  king james column and does not distract from reading the unaltered king  james text.<br />I've noticed in reviews here that some of these corrections  are controversial, but they can easily be verified by looking up the  original language.  I haven't found any inaccuracies, and have not found  the occasional opinion included by Bullinger to be offensive, although I  find him a bit too &quot;religious&quot; for my taste.   That's  understandable, because only someone very motivated would have worked so  hard to produce such an extensive work.<br />All in all I'd rate this as a  good bible for people who don't want to be influenced by other people's or  churches opinions and feel capable to come to their own conclusion based on  knowing all of the possible translations for specific words contained in a  passage being studied.  This bible might be confusing for a beginner, but  for a beginner anything but a gifted teacher will be confusing, and it's  better to stick with some technical help than to risk falling into the  hands of a particular church's doctrine, which you will do with most modern  translations.<br />When using this bible, don't be lazy, or else you probably  won't get much value out of it.  If you see a small mark over a word, go to  the side column to see the alternate translations.  Most of the time this  will pay off well.	2000-07-27

This guy talks like he's just such an expert, when I would be very interested to see if he's really accomplished much along the lines of true alchemy.  Nevertheless, everyone has different inspirations, and I did get the sense that he offered some true inspirations, so the book doesn't seem to me totally useless. Unfortunately, a lot of it sounds like the typical new age drivel that one can read in a hundred thousand other books on occult or obscure subjects, and he repeats a lot of the same ideas over and over.  Since I am new, it did offer me some insight into the actual stages of alchemy; calcination and coagulation and such because it was basically about those stages in a psychological point of view. It did offer a unique insight into those stages I'm sure, but still seems like the ideas could have been condensed a bit. He talks a lot about his and other's (famous people such as william shatner, cat steven's, etc.) personal life experiences and relates them to the stages of alchemy, ufo's (which although I don't at all disregard such subjects exactly, a lot of ufo stuff is exagerrated and made up and/or delusional which makes me question his credibility a bit and stick him a little in with the fanatical, new age types), and just seems to have a lot of exposition in his writing style that I might have been happier without. The book has a very psychological/self-helpish aura about it rather than having the aura of a tome of wisdom. Another insight of the author's that ringed true to me somehow, though, was something he wrote about the one thing and a meditation one can do where the energy is often perceived like a color in the upper color spectrum... an ultraviolet light. That struck me as having truth because I've experienced something like it in my own meditation before I read the book. So, this book is not entirely useless. It's more like you have to weed out the substance from the clutter... starting to sound alchemical?  hehe Well, that's kind of ironic. The author also resorts to drugs at times it seems, which I've personally learnt are rather useless and delusional although such methods might seem like a way to attain real truth. I think the ultimate way to attain universal truths are by using one's natural abilities such as meditation and dreams and not such crutches as drugs because crutches like that often backfire in some way.  The problem with books about these kinds of subjects is that people talk like they know so much when really their knowledge is extremely superficial or unverified/delusional. I mean, how many of them can actually show me that they know anything? It seems to me a really useful book about alchemy might be very difficult to find. So this one has some stuff to offer. I guess it depends what you're looking for. Inside the book it gives the author's webpage, so if you want to know more, I suppose you could check it out. I haven't been there, but have been meaning to visit...	2000-07-25

While this book does not explain the nuts-and-bolts of programming quantum computers, it is  nevertheless an eminently practical guide for problem solving in general,  and is curiously comforting in the process in that it rationally confirms  our deepest intuitions held from childhood.  It also reveals much about the  `sociological' aspects of doing science, from the egalitarian mode of the  symposia, to the political elitism of much of the rest of it.  This book  (while yet coy) does not ultimately shy away from the dirty-little-secrets  of scientific methodology.  I heartily endorse The Fabric of Reality as `a  must read' for anyone embarking on a career of thinking.<br />Having read this  book, I feel I am now prepared to ace my Philosophical Implications of  Science class exams (but alas, I am fifteen years too late).  Deutsch takes  us from realms of pedestrian problem solving up the heights of the Eiffel  tower where we survey the breadth of the terrain of scientific problem  solving and we learn that the two modes are the same.  All of the principal  players that were there in my philosophical science class are here again in  the Fabric of Reality, Karl Popper, Richard Feynman, Kurt Gödel, Thomas  Kuhn, Niels Bohr, to name just a few.  Deutsch explores every domain of  explanation I can imagine, quantum mechanics, final cosmology, morality,  esthetics, reasoning, all interwoven into one continuous tapestry.  Yet  this is not a new orthodoxy.  Indeed, this is finally a scathing reputation  of all orthodoxies (including by implication, postmodernism) unless  progressivism be labeled orthodoxy.<br />Deutsch's style is professorial (i.e.  often overbearing and repetitive--although he is self-effacing when  relating his own contributions).  There are plenty of rhetorical questions  that probe the reader's understanding and reveal wider and deeper  implications.  Every chapter (except the last) ends with a glossary and a  summary, which reinforces the entire tapestry and affirms Deutsch's  commitment to the reader, that they be given every opportunity to  understand the overarching argument.<br />The Fabric of Reality waxes  passionately about embracing always the best available explanations in  science.  This made the book read like a preamble to the final chapter The  Ends of the Universe which is a discussion of Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point  Theory.  Apparently the Omega Point Theory is still off limits to `serious'  science.  While it lacks the mathematical precision physics has come to  expect from new theories, the omega point theory is nevertheless a bona  fide theory with testable predictions the first of which has been verified,  the mass of the top quark, the measurement of which was eminent, hence the  necessity of Tipler publishing when he did.  While dutifully introducing  many caveats to Tipler's assertions (many of which caveats are dubious or  wrong-such as, mass and energy are limiting on the omega point trajectory),  Deutsch declares that the Omega Point Theory is the best available  explanation of the end of the universe and that escalating imperatives,  controversies, and delights should continue to engage people (subjectively)  forever.	2000-07-25

This is one of the most convincing reincarnation cases I've come across in a long time.

This  story was featured on a number of U.S. TV programs when the book first came  out, featuring both Jenny and the children from that life.  Her  still-living children, being devout Roman Catholics, do not believe in  reincarnation per se, but went on record as saying that somehow, their  mother &quot;speaks through&quot; Jenny, and they verified details of her  memories.<br /> I met Jenny Cockell at a conference in Oslo, Norway, in  1994 and found her to be totally sincere and quite credible.

Like the Transpersonal Psychologists Gary Zurkov, in his book \\"Seat of the Soul,\\" challenges psychology to  include the language of the spirit. Psychology and spirituality are  integrated in Transpersonal Psychology but the American Psychological  Association, APA, does not recognize Transpersonal Psychology because the  \\"soul\\" cannot be verified scientifically. However, many of Gary's  descriptions of the human psyche ring true for me. That we are evolving  from a five-sensory to multi-sensory beings; that we have non-physical  teachers; that our purpose in life is to align the personality with the  soul; that mental illness is a shattered spirit; that we are reincarnated;  that our choices result in positive or negative karma; that evil is an  absence of light and that the universe is alive, intelligent and  compassionate.  It's sad when a physicist presents a more comprehensive  theory of personality than a psychologist. But I'm also glad that \\"Seat of  the Soul\\" had touched and helped so many people.	2000-07-25

The idea of writing history is to inform and educate and enlighten---and especially to expand on previous attempts to tell the same story.  Unfortuately, depsite the enthusiasm of the author and his fellow trekkers  in the winter woods, this book is almost worthless as &quot;history&quot;.   Its main failing is that it invents so much of the history that needed no  invention, history that is otherwise clearly documented and that should  have been carefully consulted and analyzed before any writing began.<br />      Footnotes, which one myopic reviewer considers a sign of an  &quot;armchair&quot; historian, often supply the only evidence to prove an  historical point, and verify the truth.  But that serious study and  documentation should be dismissed so cavalierly by the author's friends is,  perhaps, in light of the book itself, not so surprising.<br />    A modern day  hunter is not necessarily the best equipped person to write a HISTORY of  hunting; and modern-day Ranger reenactors, no matter how extensively they  have reenacted, are not necessarily the best equipped to write a HISTORY of  Rangers.<br />     The evidence from the account of Captain Pringle clearly  notes that the pursuing Indians attempted to &quot;intercept&quot; the  fleeing Rangers after the battle, and in some cases succeeded.  That Rogers  and a number of Rangers were forced to turn to escape by climbing the  mountain suggests such an interception, and one quite far from the  battlefield, too. Both pursued and pursuers traveled far afield, and in  many directions. Even Montcalm noted that those Rangers who had escaped the  Indians would &quot;perish of want&quot; in the wilderness.  Rogers' own  servant was separated from him as the Rangers fled; and survivors kept  trickling into Fort Edward days after Rogers himself returned to it.<br />      There is absolutely NO contemporary source that states that the companies  of captains Hobbs and Speakman ever wore grey duffle coats or jackets, asthe author implies.<br />     The author's other reviewers forgive him for  putting buckskin hunting shirts on the early Ranger companies; but are  uninformed readers allowed this charitable luxury? <br />     Rogers implies  that the battle started after 3 PM; but the accounts of the battle received  at Fort Edward, from the mouths of other survivors, and subsequently  recorded in diaries of soldiers there as well as in reports sent to  newspapers, clearly agree on the 3:00-4:30 PM timeframe.<br />     Rogers'  Leap was the name applied to &quot;Rogers' Slide&quot;---as we know it  today--- as early as October 1760 by a British officer travelling up Lake  George: just two and a half years after the battle.  In 1766 &quot;Rogers'  Rock&quot; was noted in a land petition. Why?  Mountains are not named  after men merely because they happened to have hiked in their vicinity. <br />      The author of the book insists that climbing to the top of the Rock in  wintertime would have been foolish.  This is clearly a case of the author  not having done his homework--or fieldwork. That some Rangers DID make  their way to the top of the Rock after the battle is indeed verified in the  testimony of survivor Robert Cochran.  <br />     As for Rogers himself---and  his Rangers in general---crossing and climbing the mountains around Lake  George in wintertime was not the challenge that aging modern reenactors  evidently feel it to be.  In March of 1759, for instance, Rogers and his  men engaged pursuing French and Indians in a running battle from the south  arm of Lake Champlain several miles westward through the mountains leading  to Lake George, and in weather much more severe than they had encountered  on March 13, 1758.  Rogers climbed &quot;a very steep mountain&quot; west  of Fort St. Frederic in the winter of 1756, possibly today's Bulwagga  Mountain or Coot's Hill, to make observations; and took a British Engineer  to the top of today's Mount Defiance, in the winter of 1759, to observe  Fort Carillon.  In February of 1758, Rogers rushed a party across the  snowbound mountains east of Lake George in an attempt to cut off a French  and Indian raiding party that was heading home via South Bay.  <br />      Meanwhile, other Rangers and even Provincial soldiers were ROUTINELY  cimbing the mountains around Lake George in the dead of winter, AND on  snowshoes; and no one ever wrote that it had been such an impossible or  daunting thing, as modern reenactors seem to believe it was.  <br />     It is  regrettable that the friends of any author should be so partisan as to  defend him even when he errs so flagrantly and fabricates so much that he  is presenting as &quot;truth&quot;.  This is a disservice to everyone  involved, including the author; but the biggest loser here is neither  author nor friend, reader nor reviewer.  Rather, history itself becomes the  ultimate victim.	2000-07-23

Therefore, it is primarily with behavior of the former and latter  that a behavioral understanding of what you are doing and saying is  profited.      <br />Dr. Skinner's approach to verbal behavior is derived from  countless experiments in the analysis of behavior, experiments in which the  principles of behavior have been rigorously studied, demonstrated, and  verified.  It is consequently not unnatural that finding it practicable and  convenient, as undoubtedly it is, to verbal behavior is justifiable.  Such  a view obviously renders it easy to welcome behavior as an appropriate  subject matter in its own right.  Moreover, it is downright profitable to  welcome behavior, which its first implication is the fact of objective and  successful action!	2000-07-23

I bought the book based on these glowing 5 star reviews.  At  first glance, I thought the book was complete phantasy and the authors must be just mad...yet curiously the book contains some down-to-earth examples.   For example:<br />&quot;[Tom Peters] initially made his name and fame in 1982  by preaching the virtue in 'pursuing excellence' and of MBWA -'...by  walking ...' A decade later he seemed to recant a bit, deciding the who  'excellence' theme was 'about wacky idea' and the companies he selected as  'excellent' were not that, after all. They just did some 'excellent' (does  that also mean 'wacky'?) things. [The text continues with 8 more  high-quality paragraphs of this Tom Peters argument/analysis...see  pp.24-25]  &quot;<br />Such depth is not consistent with a Snake Oil  business/psychology book.<br />Nevertheless, I must warn you that I cannot  fully endorse this &quot;vMEMES&quot; concept as it seems analogous to an  only-in-Alice-in-Wonderland &quot;cross-breading&quot;: 1/4 respected  Freud's psychodynamics, 1/4 Eastern Philosophy bio-energy fields (eg Chi  from Taoism), 1/4 semiotics, 1/4 molecular biology.<br />In fact, this  &quot;cross-breading&quot; is built into the very spelling of the word  &quot;Memes.&quot;  The book calls a &quot;vMEMES&quot; a  &quot;PsychoSocial DNA&quot;; &quot;MEMEs&quot; conveniently rhyming with  genes.  Also of note is &quot;MEMEs&quot; conceptual and etymological  similarity to the semiotic terms: morphemes and phonemes.  (From Schaum's  Outline on Psychology:  Morphemes--&quot;the smallest meaningful units of a  language&quot;; Phonemes--&quot;the basic sound or inflection components of  a spoken language&quot;) <br />Conclusion:  I haven't decided if the good and  insightful business examples are just facades covering over the sweetest  snake oil I've yet seen in a junk business/psychology textbook or if the  originator of Spiral Dynamics and the authors of this book have discovered  a useful, yet unverified, dynamic component of the human being's  bioelectric personality pattern (ie, the energy that moves around the  neurons of our brains' when we think).<br />About my Rating:  First, this book  is currently in my &quot;X-files&quot; category.  Second, it has no index.  So I've given it 2 stars out 5.  (I could change my mind in a few months if  these &quot;vMEMEs&quot; explain any phenomena I experience in the areas of  &quot;mastering values, leadership, or change.&quot;  I have yet  too...still why no index, professors Beck and Cowan?)	2000-07-22
US	52785032	R35M94PHFXPYFF	038549341X	277823768	Actual Innocence: Five Days to Execution, and Other Dispatches From the Wrongly Convicted	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Actual Innocence Avoids the PROBLEM	The reader should first go through Appendix 1 and 2 of this book, in order to understand what the authors are driving at.  Appendix 1 has a list of reforms, which they claim will cut down greatly on convictions of innocent  people.  Appendix 2 has a number of pie and bar charts that give details  concerning 62 exonerations, via DNA testing, of people convicted in the US  for crimes like rape and murder. The twelve chapters are devoted to  explanations of particular cases, most drawn from the 62, that bolster the  arguments they make for reforms.<br />One main theme throughout the book is  the unreliability of eyewitness testimony, even when the eyewitness is very  positive about the identification.  Scheck and Neufeld found it to be, by  far, the most common cause (52 out of 62 cases) of innocents being  convicted.  Some of the suggestions for improvement have to do with how  lineups and photo spreads are shown to witnesses.  For example, sequential  rather than parallel presentation is to be preferred.  Several times, in  Actual Innocence, the authors cite cases of &quot;classic cross-racial  misidentifications&quot;.  However their own data refutes that race is a  big factor in these witnessing mistakes.  A pie chart in Appendix 2 shows  that in 52 cases, 55% had people of the same race making a mistake, while  36% were cross racial and in 9% the race of one of the parties is unknown.   <br />Another issue, whose treatment bothered me, was microscopic hair  analysis.  Scheck and Neufeld insist that it is a scientific fraud, not  good for inclusion or exclusion, that has played a part in 18 out of the 62  false convictions.  They claim that mitochondrial DNA analysis can be used  instead and is much more accurate.  If I am not mistaken, mitochondrial DNA  analysis might not be able to distinguish between siblings or cousins whose  maternal line back to Eve becomes identical after a few generations.  They  give examples to show that there are many incompetents doingmicroscopic  hair analysis and testifying about the results in court, but no references  to scientific studies that refute the entire subject.  But in Chapter 10  they are very upset when a prosecutor deprecated a Negroid pubic hair,  found in a white rape victim's bed.  A hair analyst had testified that its  microscopic characteristics were not that of the defendant's pubic hairs.  The prosecutor had come up with some explanations like, perhaps the victim  had transported it to her bed by using a public rest room, or the sheet was  laundered at a public laundry, or blacks had lived in the apartment 6  months before.  In other words, the same kind of nonsense used by defense  lawyers to explain away trace evidence when it implicates their client.  As  a matter of fact, there were three such pubic hairs to explain.  However,  the prosecution had implied that there was only one and the defense seems  not to have known that fact.  But who cares, if such hair analysis can't be  trusted?  In this case it was later verified by DNA testing.<br />Actual  Innocence scores its best points on the remedies for problems caused by  false identification, false confessions and jailhouse snitches.  I find it  less convincing on the structural and procedural problems in the US legal  system.  Its solution to inadequate legal representation for indigent  defendants is to pay public defenders as much as prosecutors.  Concerning  the perverse verdicts of juries, they only offer this naive utterance from  one of their unjustly convicted clients:<br />&quot;Jurors should get  innocence training&quot;.  &lt;They need to be told&gt; &quot;'You're doing  this because we have to find the truth.  The police haven't found the  truth.  The district attorney hasn't found the truth.  Only you  can.'&quot;<br />After the Louise Woodward trial, Scheck suggested that a jury  of experts should judge such a complicated scientific case.  Nothing that  politically incorrect, is uttered in Actual Innocence.  (By the way, there  is no mention of either Woodward or OJ Simpson in the book, even on the  dust jacket).  The distinguished American judge and law professor, Richard  Posner, wrote about the truth finding capabilities of the American criminal  justice system (Times of London Literary Supplement, Feb. 7, 1999),  &quot;It has become commonplace that an innocent person has a better chance  of acquittal in a European than in an American court, and a guilty person,  a better chance of acquittal in an American than in a European  court&quot;.<br />The reader of Scheck, Neufeld and Dwyer would be well served  by reading the book, Posner was reviewing, &quot;Trials Without Truth&quot;  by William T. Pizzi, ISBN 0814766498.  It addresses the general problem of  truth finding in the American criminal justice system, a problem that  Actual Innocence hardly confronts.	2000-07-21

Extremely readable and not couched in overly academic language,  the book is useful for anyone who needs solid, reasonable information on  the subject--the lay public, academics, the clergy, or police officers will  all benefit from reading this work and keeping an open mind.<br />Victor  follows the panic from a number of angles; religious, sociologic,  folkloric, and so on.  For each he presents a balanced case that seeks not  to  ridicule anyone who &quot;bought into&quot; the stories of widespread  Satanism, but simply to understand why they did so.  He also shows how some  people (psychologists, police, and so on) actually thrived on the notoriety  they achieved in their capacity as &quot;witch hunter&quot; and sought to  keep the panic alive in order to further their own agendas.<br />Excellent  reading, and a book that shows the danger of blindly believing rumors and  unverified conspiracy tales.	2000-07-15

We followed the very detailed trail directions for a hike labeled as &quot;Easy for Children&quot;. The trail was reasonably easy to follow at first, but led  us through over a mile of land that was regularly posted as private  property / no trespassing. But much worse, at the end, the trail simply  disappeared. The book mentions that you may have to bushwhack for 100 feet  at the end, but we were up to our waists in thorns, unable to see our  destination and at least several hundred YARDS from where we needed to go.  Definitely not easy to do when you are carrying a three-year-old. In  retrospect, we should have verified the trail with the park rangers who  would have told us that no such trail exists on park land. In the future,  we will not trust this book.	2000-07-15

It is always easy  to point out maniacal campaigns for fiscal &quot;rewards&quot; of the  world's multi-national companies and whinge in rather general ways.  &quot;McLibel&quot; makes some general comments about globalisation, but  uses the courageous courtcase involving Steel and Morris against McDonald's  to illustrate these concerns. I feel that the London Greenpeace movement  probably should have verified factual evidence BEFORE putting out a  &quot;fact sheet&quot; that has taken five years to do this  retrospectively. I have so much admiration for Steel and Morris and wish  that it was possible to just phone them and thank them personally for their  efforts and sacrifice of time, lifestyle and relationships. It is  encouraging to read, after so much bad news presented by Vidal, that there  are thousands of dissident groups speaking back to the corporate world. I  am moved to become involved. I think Vidal's style of writing was more  convincing in the presentation of factual information, than in his  proselytising sections and his presentations of character. Some  characterisations were as Dickensian as his Chapter introductory  quotations. However, I think this is an essential read and I plan on using  this text in the class room as a companion read to the Australian  documentary about the same events.	2000-07-09

I do not wish to dispute this gem of wisdom when it comes to  everyday dealings with people.  I do, however, think his application of  this on the international political level is misguided, wrong, and quite  frankly, none of His Holiness' business.<br />He does not seem to recognize  that war is not a manifestation of a lack of compassion in people.  Rather  it is the only means ever known to man for oppressed peoples to gain  dignity and to ensure the conditions for their continued prosperity.   Americans who pride themselves as such would certainly be hypocritical to  disagree with this viewpoint since it is only with past successes in war  that America is what it is today and it is only with the worlds largest  nuclear arsenal can it ensure its position going forward.  This is as much  a fact of the human condition as our vital organs and biological functions.   Remove any of these and we cease to be human.  Even the Dalai Lama admits  that this is an unsolvable paradox.<br />The view that everything and everyone  is interconnected is a truly inspiring perspective, as is the recognition  that we all want to be happy and avoid suffering, but sometimes short term  suffering needs to be endured in order to achieve longer term lasting  happiness.  War is one example.  Another is NOT providing aid to  impoverished nations.  By giving bits and pieces of food and medicine to  poor countries we are alleviating suffering for a few people for a few  moments but are prolonging the suffering of entire populations for  generations to come.  This perspective is almost purposely ignored in the  book, giving the impression that the true purpose of the book is akin to  thatof any major religion -- ie to instill guilt on the masses to keep  them focused on themselves so they don't consider threatening the world's  power centers --taking care, however, to leave out the hocus pocus not  because of any new revelation, but because the falsehood of any hocus pocus  can be easily verified by schoolchildren with the advent of modern  telecommunications.<br />If you, the prospective reader, can sympathize with  my comments, save your time and money and watch about an hour of CNN  International.  The message is exactly the same.	2000-06-30

Again and again he professes to be bowled over by the brilliant insights of the experts he's  interviewing, though their insights often seemed pretty shallow and dubious  to me. For instance, he asks the question of whether the Resurrection story  could be a hoax, only to be told that significant historical movements  &quot;never&quot; originate in hoaxes. Yet at another point in the book, he  clearly insinuates that The Book of Mormon was a hoax (because its  historical claims have not been verified by archaeology). Well, if so, then  how does Strobel account for the considerable success of the Mormon Church  -- certainly a significant historical movement? Can a hoax generate a large  religious movement, or not? He can't have it both ways -- but he does, over  and over again. Obvious follow-up questions are not asked; alternative  points of view are not sought; &quot;friendly&quot; witnesses are tracked  down even over a distance of thousands of miles, while potentially  &quot;hostile&quot; witnesses are not interviewed at all. On the plus side,  the book is readable, and some of the interviews are at least  thought-provoking. For a more sophisticated, but equally pious, defense of  the New Testament, look at Donald Spoto's &quot;The Hidden Jesus: A New  Life.&quot; For a rationalist alternative to Strobel's book, read  &quot;Asimov's Guide to the Bible (the New Testament).&quot;	2000-06-20

There is also some information about old  kobujutsu masters like Aragaki, Matsumura, Sakugawa and  others.<br />Unfortunately, except for the cover, there isn't one old  photograph of Shinken Taira himself. Why not? What possible reason could  there be to not have ONE?<br />The writing is a little stiff, almost like a  transliteration rather than a translation and much of the information  included is just lists of members of Taira's organizations at various  points and their teaching ranks.<br />The old history of past masters is  limited, un-verified anecdotes mostly, and all very cursory  information,  not much useful detail with any sort of verification of where the  information may have come from. The translator certainly didn't add any of  this to the mix, which would have been nice.<br />Overall, the more I think  about it, even as I write this review, I realize that there's more bad than  good, which is why I give it a 2 star rating rather than a 3.<br />I would  only buy this book if you are a big kobudo practitioner or you are a die  hard karate and kobudo history nut.

My first edition has a stunning brown and white photo on the cover showing Collins in his Free State uniform, and even the unusual weight and dimensions of the book suggests the emotionally  moving experience within. This is a complete biography which begins with  Collins' childhood, and it follows him all the way to where he is  ruthlessly assassinated in Cork by political opponents. They were mostly  liberals and communists who were not supported by the people when they  advocated another more radical revolution. There's an especially generous  collection of photographs to enhance the text here as well. Until this book  was published, there just wasn't a complete or accurate biography on  Collins available anywhere, though he is certainly one of the most  interesting people in Irish history. This injustice was eventually  corrected when the Irish book industry revitalized after many years of  repression from Irish politicians such as Eamon de Valera. Such opponents  knew their own deeds were shallow in comparison to those of Collins and his  supporters. They preferred the public not to read the inside story of how  they abandoned Collins when he negotiated the treaty with the British  government that formed today's Irish Republic, and they are widely  suspected of contributing to his assassination in Cork (de Valera was in  the immediate area). Then came this landmark book in 1992 by Coogan,  followed by the 1996 film by Neil Jordan, and Irish-Americans suddenly  realized what they had been cheated of. In one of the supreme ironies of  history, however, Collins is occasionally hijacked by the Marxists of Sinn  Fein when they shake down the Irish in America. They claim that they have  the moral authority to finish what Collins could not. Unfortunately, from  so far away, some Irish Americans have difficulty discerning the difference  between Collins' ideas about uniting the Irish - by developing trust  between the Irish Nationalistcommunity and the Irish of British descent  community - and his opponents ideas which advocate class warfare and fuel  sectarian tensions. There's an unrelated television commercial in the US  which could provide a good one liner to fit this unlikely situation  perfectly: &quot;How is that possible?&quot; Yes, it can be verified that  the Collins people greatly appreciated the contribution that James Connolly  made to military tactics, but they are also on record as being Ireland's  most popular opposition to the Marxism that Connolly and others advocated.  Collins and those close to him believed firmly in a free enterprise system  shaped by a more traditional and gentle Irish socialism. In Ireland the  average political enthusiast knows who's who. This is the reason there is  no mention of Gerry Adams when Coogan finishes with his chapter  &quot;Honoring the Dead?&quot; During the Irish Civil War Collins' people  risked their lives to stop left wing subversion. In today's Irish Republic  the party which Collins' supporters formed after his death lives on; that's  Fine Gael, and its opposition to Marxism is still very much alive. For  anyone who is still confused or doubtful, one of the following books can  fill you in on the aggressively anti-Communist nature of the Collins camp:  First there's The Blueshirts and Irish Politics by Michael Cronin, printed  in Dublin, Ireland by Four Courts Press 1997; then there's an older but  better book, The Blueshirts by Maurice Manning which was printed in Dublin,  Ireland by Gill and Macmillan in 1970; and even Yeats, Ireland and Fascism  by Elizabeth Cullingford which was published in New York, New York by N.Y.

It's not Quod Erat Demonstrandum; no, it's not even Quickly Ends Dandruff. Then, what is it? Quantum ElectroDynamics. Now, if you're ignorant of physics, you're probably still thinking, \\"That says a whole  lot. What is it?\\" By this rather formidable name, you might not be able to  tell if you want to read the book or not, so I'll synopsize. Over three  quarters (75%, if you prefer--ooh, I can do math!) of this book explains  movements and interactions of electrons and photons expressed as  probabilities. The last section discusses a variation of QED, quantum  chromodynamics (i.e. quarks). Unlike some abstruse conjectures (most  notably, string theory), quantum electrodynamics can be and has been  experimentally verified. In fact, it is the most accurate theory ever  devised! This does not mean that QED is totally compliant with common sense  (fortunately; physics addicts often find common sense to be rather  dull--and incorrect!). The reader learns to accept that light does not  always travel in straight paths, that light reflects from all parts of a  mirror, and that electrons can travel backward in time. Richard Feynman,  who (along with Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger) was awarded the  1965 Nobel Prize for his work on this theory, elucidates QED so that even  those who have never before studied physics can understand it. (To be more  accurate, they can understand *how* QED works; Feynman admits that no one,  himself included, truly understands *why* QED works.) If you already are  familiar with the theory, you are likely to become bored with this book. On  the other hand, I'm not sure that this book is the best for physics  neophytes, since it is specific in explaining this one given area (even  skipping the historical background present in most popular accounts of  physics). You might want to first obtain more general knowledge of modern  physics. If you find optics interesting, definitely read this book. For  anyone who wants a deeper knowledge ofmodern physics or chemistry, an  understanding of quantum electrodynamics is a sine qua non, and this book  is probably the most explicit introduction on the market.<br />~pythia~	2000-06-08
US	53032188	R2JPMJOW2YMCDU	0271017511	622880076	Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer’s Manual of the Fifteenth Century (Magic in History)	Books	5	67	70	N	Y	Truly the Best of the Series	I consistently maintain an up to date collection of the Magic in History series, which I consider to be top notch for the occultist wishing to peruse past traditions. The series is as important for one's bookshelf and  reading as Agrippa's Occult Philosophy series, in my opinion, or the Key of  Solomon.  However, unlike the two mentioned, most books in the series are  historical suveys of theory and less practical (aka: grimoires). This  particular text, however, is the exception, and is therefore by far my  favorite. The book begins with summaries, in english, of various key  experiments and practices outlined in the ritual handbook, followed by a  full text, in Latin, of the manuscript. At the very end of the book are  copies of the pages of the text itself. The manuscript is a bit of an  enigma, in that the first two sections of it are missing, its authorship  and ownership is uncertain, and even its date of origin cannot be verified.  However, given the overlap between Agrippa's masterwork, one can see  variations on magickal theory of the 15th and 16th centuries. While Agrippa  dealt mostly with high magick, this manual, mislabeled necromancy, tends to  stray into what is truly black arts. What is truly fascinating is that the  fundamental theory and, indeed, basic practice of both the  &quot;divine&quot; and &quot;infernal&quot; arts remain relatively  constant, despite supposedly different sources of influence. To the modern  occultist, this is a given. However, in the context of the period at which  this text was supposedly written, this insight is profound and surprising.  It strongly supports my personal belief that the concept of &quot;God&quot;  and &quot;Devil&quot; are literally two perceptions of the same entity, and  are only divided in the fragile and limited human psyche.	2000-06-05
US	52505911	R37KJR6BIYGWKF	0844615714	256812943	Language, Truth and Logic	Books	5	58	59	N	N	A clear presentation of an important philosophical viewpoint	If you are tired of reading summaries and general introductions to philosophy and would like to start reading original works, &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; is a great place to start.  The book is clear and  concise, and is the classic presentation of logical positivism in English.<br />The concept underlying Ayer's discussion is the &quot;principle of  verifiability,&quot; which defines a statement as being &quot;literally  meaningful&quot; only if it either is logically necessary  (&quot;analytical&quot;) or can be empirically verified as being either  true or false.  Under this definition, metaphysical statements are not  literally meaningful, and so are properly part of theology rather than  philosophy.<br />Ayer believes that many philosophical debates (such as those  about ethics or about the nature of the soul) stem from arguing about  metaphysical statements as if they were literally meaningful.  He believes  that once metaphysics has been eliminated from philosophy, these debates  will seem silly and the questions that underlie them will be recognized as  theological rather than philosophical.  So once he has established the  principle of verifiability and explained how he identifies statements as  either verifiable or analytical, Ayer spends the rest of the book applying  this principle to various &quot;philosophical&quot; questions.<br />Of  course, the place of metaphysics in philosophy is itself debatable.  Ayer's  conception of philosophy is relatively narrow, and many readers will prefer  a wider definition of philosophy that includes some (or all) of the  metaphysical statements that he banishes.  Others will be thrilled to  finally read a philosophical work that cuts through the mystical goo spread  so liberally and destructively by other thinkers.  Whether or not one  agrees with Ayer's approach and conclusions, one has to appreciate his  clear presentation of an important philosophical viewpoint.	2000-06-05

I am the mother of the nun who broke her vows as written in the book, &quot;The Buddha from Brooklyn.&quot;  The author, Martha Sherril, had spent some time interviewing me and had promised a balanced and fair  account.  Much to my amazement, most of the quotes attributed to me are  incorrect, even after the author spent additional time questioning me as to  key events in the story!  Only one quote is even close to accurate,  although it is taken out of context in order to slant the story to a  particular point of view.<br />I was further stunned that the author has me as  a single unmarried mother in 1984 since I have been happily married to Ed  Meurer since 1977.  The author had verified this fact, but then perhaps she  did not want to tell my daughter's story correctly.  I also see the author  has my daughter sprouting stitches and my going to the hospital because I  am told to, not out of a mother's natural concern for her child, even  though I am identified as a loving woman.  How logical is this?<br />This  story is a journey into the author's doubts and fears of spirituality,  groups and devotion to a teacher.  However, labeling this story as  investigative is an extreme misnomer.  Make no mistake, this is just  another example of expose' journalism.<br />On the positive side, this book  is an excellent place for me to practice equanimity between fame and  infamy. How else would I get such an opportunity as I am just another  mother. With the recent death of my father I am reminded of the  preciousness of life and that life is too short to worry about what anyone  has to say about me or anyone else. If love is what I want in the world, I  will have to start by loving this author. May we all raise ourselves above  our doubts and fears and see each other purely.<br />Love,<br />Ayla Meurer	2000-06-04
US	49463225	R1BAJJADRGK49D	0816028559	148121807	The Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land	Books	4	13	15	N	N	A Survey of Archæological Evidence Reaching Far in the Past	Archæology constitutes a meticulous study of ancient artifacts and residues from periods in human history remote to the modern world.  This field of anthropology is marked by differences in emphasis, depending on  the region under excavation.  In the southern Levant, such focus generally  accentuates what has been termed &quot;biblical archæology&quot;, designed  to augment historical understanding of the scriptures, both the Hebrew  Canon and the New Testament.  Aside from difficulties inherent in  synthsizing descriptions written or edited centuries after the events  narrated, often with religious revelations overriding historical  &quot;accuracy&quot; (a concept whose importance has been presumed only  relatively recently), archæology--being predominantly a material  discipline--can interpret only what is physically observable in the  present.<br />Recent decades have witnessed profound changes in archæology,  expanding beyond the evidence of technological advancement--from  Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to Neolithic agriculturists to the Bronze and  Iron ages--as well as political demarcations--Canaanite city states,  Isrælite monarchies, hegemonies under Persian, Roman or Ottoman rule.  Social archæology--intended to examine the culture of the region in  question--is the theme in _The_Archæology_of_Society_in_the_Holy_Land_,  edited by Thomas E. Levy, professor of Judaic Studies at the University of  California, San Diego.  The articles cover a wide chronology from the early  Paleolithic age to the modern era in terms of material culture, as well as  flora, fauna, climate, economy, and manufacture.  To preclude an overly  narrow focus on Biblical periods, the thirty authors devote over a third of  the book to the premetal times.  Most of the dates are given in BCE and CE  (which I do not appreciate, preferring the more traditional BC and AD),  except the prehistoric periods which are rendered BP [before present].  The  text is profusely illustrated, not only with photographs of pottery and  plaques, but replete with detailed diagrams of excavated sites and shaded  relief maps depicting these locations.  This collective endeavor has been  dedicated to the spirit of Fernand Braudel, the French historian who  developed the theory of longue dur&eacute;e or long duration undercurrents which  (allegedly) act independently of individual activities for any given span.  Although this suggests a somewhat Tolstoyan conceit, the analysis presented  renders support to people being influenced by the conditions in which they  live.<br />_The_Archæology_of_Society_ begins with a preface describing its  interdisciplinary approach weaving anthropology (the study of culture),  history (textual criticism of ancient records), geoscience (including  climatology and geology), archeometry (artifacts dating, materials  identification), and environmental archæology (encompassing botany and  zoology).  The six parts that follow are further subdivided chronologically  into 32 chapters.  The climate in this constrained territory ranges from  Mediterranean to arid.  Many areas have limited or uncertain rainfall, and  thus subsistence agriculture becomes precarious on such marginal land  during drought without supplementing harvests by herding goats, sheep  and/or cattle.  On the eastern side of the Jordan River, Moab and Edom  showed greater reliance on animal husbandry than the wetter regions further  north.  The variation in the land's topological environment is exhibited by  the diversity of flora:  2682 plant species in 29,600 square kilometers as  compared to a slightly lesser number on the California coastal region  within more than double the area.  Also, since the southern Levant stands  at the crossroads between Egypt and Mesopotamia, the region serves as a  convenient invasion route, with the inhabitants and political systems  frequently becoming collateral casualties.  These episodes serve to  amalgamate societies with cultural cross-fertilization, in the aftermath of  the initial destruction.<br />While many archæological publications on the  holy land have concentrated on political and/or religious history of  Israel, _The_Archæology_of_Society_ discusses the culture and demographics  of the inhabitants.  One of the most notable observations in this volume is  the catastrophic decline in material living conditions with corresponding  population reductions and health deterioration (based on tooth wear and  skeletal hypoplastia), particularly in the desert borders at the end of  particular eras, either due to dramatic changes in climate or sociological  factors such as military incursion.  The impact of these conditions appears  to be especially pronounced at the collapse of the Chalcolithic (~3500  BCE), the end of the middle Bronze Age (~1500 BCE), the beginning of the  Iron Age (~1200 BCE), and the end of the Byzantine period (638  CE)--followed by very gradual and intermittent recovery.  And while no  explicit means of invasion for the Israelites has been discovered--unlike  the Philistines who apparently came by sea and left pottery--the  archæological impression from these tribes is implied by a rapid decrease  in the percentage of swine bones found in the highlands through the middle  to late Bronze Ages.<br />Many chapters report social stratification, for  different societies are often characterizable by the different quality and  type of items associated with various members in the community.  Although  such economic differentiation arose in the grave-goods monopoly of the  middle Bronze Age &eacute;lite (who were buried with ceremonial daggers and axes,  in contrast to spears for the common man), the political dimension of this  stratification developed later as a defensive measure from the need by a  central state (such as the Davidic suzerainty) for professional armies and  economic specialization.  Despite this, tribalism con-tinued in areas of  marginal interest to the capitals.  The excavated remains from the Iron Age  suggest that the regimes had little direct impact on inhabitants outside  the court, but probably received their principal revenue from maintaining  protection against banditry for passage across the highways--a neglected  function during the Roman occupation which contributed to the poverty and  unrest during their administration.  While the prophet Jeremiah condemned  the extravagance of the wealthy, archæology reveals less material  distinction between households towards the end of Judah's autonomy than  from subsequent periods of foreign oppression.  Agrarian cultures, valuing  continuity, frequently oppose incursion by disruptive economic influence  from alien invaders.  In the case of the Israelites, this resistance was  brought against the Greeks during the Macdonian rule.  Such attitudes can  be exacerbated if natives are forced into the corv&eacute;e by their masters as  unwilling contributors to the new order, as with Herod's construction at  Cæsaria, or from the income-redistributionist taxation imposed by the  Romans.<br />Unlike other related books that cover ancient Israel,  _The_Archæology_of_Society_ eschews quoting the historical or prophetic  books in the scriptures, even in chapters where the Isrælite and Judaic  kingdoms are discussed.  This partially reflects a current perception that  the scriptures represent a redacted account of the past interpreted in the  light of ethical or religious precepts.  The few exceptions which cite the  Old Testament include references to Jeroboam's temple at Dan in 1 Kn  12:29-30, Sheshak's invasion to identify the earliest verified biblical  date of 925 BCE in 1 Kn 14:25-26, Omri's purchase of Samaria in 1 Kn 16:24,  and Mesha's raids commemorated by the Moab stele in 2 Kn 3:4-27.  Josephus  is cited more often, at least with regard to his accounts from the Roman  pe-riod of the first century CE in which he wrote.<br />While  _The_Archæology_of_Society_ is not intended for casual reading at the  beach, the book is a valuable contribution to the historical and cultural  background in the region where Judaism and Christianity were founded..

This volume interweaves two main themes--the technical difficulties in  designing and fabricating nuclear weapons, and the political motivations  commanding these efforts along with their strategic implications.  <br />Many  of the major participants are familiar to readers of Soviet history, such  as Stalin, Beria, Molotov and Khrushchev.  However, the important actors in  this drama were the technical experts who created these engines of  destruction on behalf of their masters.  Many prominent scientists labored  to provide the theoretical and experimental support demanded by Stalin for  rapid industrialization, laying the groundwork for the tremendous  infrastructure needed to duplicate the achievements of the Manhattan  Project years later.  Research in radioactivity eventually led to the first  spontaneous fission experiment in 1940, but this did not attract attention  in the West, where restrictions began for publication on nuclear physics.   <br />Work on fission continued during the war, but the lack of uranium  prevented much advancement.  Holloway, in examining the directives during  this period, found priorities unchanged following the Potsdam meeting, in  contrast to the subsequent demand for uranium production after Hiroshima.   He attributes Stalin's casual reaction to Truman's mention of a new weapon  to skepticism regarding its importance.  But the bomb as a colossal  reality, not merely as an intelligence phantom, presented Stalin with a new  strategic contention.  His response was to show resolve in the face of  anticipated intimidation coupled with orders to develop this technology  independently.  However, he only recognized the bomb as an instrument of  Anglo-American policy, and refused to consider it militarily decisive in  any potential conflict.  When challenging US policy over Berlin, for  example, Stalin carefully applied pressure while keeping his options open  and took care not to escalate tensions beyond retraction.  <br />The  achievement of creating an atomic bomb, given the devastating post-war  depravation of the Soviet Union can be credited primarily to Igor  Kurchatov, the scientific director of the nuclear project from 1942 until  his death in 1960.  Kurchatov was a well respected figure in Soviet  physics, but he also provided a methodical and systematic orchestration to  a project with many difficult sundry en-gineering obstacles to overcome,  not to mention the menacing oversight by Beria, head of the NKVD.  Although  awarded privileged status in the post-war Soviet Union, the scientists  recognized their position as predicated on successful completion of this  task.  <br />The primary obstacle remained the inadequate supply of uranium  metal until 1948 when the first production reactor was built.  Uranium  isotope separation and plutonium precipitation were tackled with  indus-trial vigor.  The gaseous diffusion facility, modeled on the Oak  Ridge plant involved particular engineering difficulties to be solved  before uranium enrichment could proceed.  Yulii Khariton, director of the  secret nu-clear research laboratory Arzamas-16, led the study on the  physics of detonation.  Implosion was needed to compress the plutonium a  few microseconds in order to start the chain reaction.  Their first atom  bomb was exploded August 1949 at Semipalatinsk with a yield of 20 kilotons  of TNT.  Thus the Soviet Union joined the nuclear club.  <br />While espionage  yielded useful information at the West's expense, Holloway argues that  Klaus Fuchs saved the Soviets only about a year or two by giving dimensions  of the plutonium implosion design.  He compares the first Soviet atom bomb  explosion in 1949 with the first British demonstration in 1952 despite much  closer collaboration with the Americans than anything obtained  clandestinely by their Soviet counterparts.  Holloway also contends that  the contribution by captured Germans was comparatively minor and sped the  project by only a few weeks or months--principally in the area of  processing uranium.  <br />While the bomb was being developed, Stalin  initiated orders on delivery systems--bombers by Vladimir Myasishchev and  rockets by Sergei Korolev.  In Stalin's view, another war was inevitable  within two decades, and the atomic bomb would serve as merely another  policy instrument.  After he died in March 1953, his successors embarked on  a less confrontational rapproachement with the West.  <br />After the Soviets  demonstrated their ability to create weapons based on nuclear fission,  Truman decided to pursue the hydrogen bomb, because there was no indication  that Stalin would reciprocate a policy of restraint.  After some false  starts, a method to use X-ray compression from fission to implode the  thermonuclear charge was discovered, enabling a yield limited only by the  quantity of nuclear fuel.  The Mike test in November 1952 verified this  concept with an ungainly 60-ton refrigerated assembly.  Meanwhile, the  Russians embarked on fusion independently.  A young physicist, Andrei  Sakarov began work in 1948 and joined the Arzamas-16 facility, developing  the &quot;Layer Cake&quot; which resembled the boosted fission weapon,  before advancing on the two-stage Super.  The first thermonuclear bomb was  exploded in August 1953, and apparently alarmed Kurchatov, being 20 times  more power-ful than the first Soviet fission bomb four years earlier.  In  November 1955, the first two-stage thermonuclear bomb with a yield of 1.6  megatons was exploded.  <br />The first Soviet fusion explosion produced a  profound change in the attitudes of politburo members about the same time  that Americans realized that this new weapon represented a far more potent  destructive force than the fission variety.  In the aftermath of this  revelation, a more conciliatory &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; doctrine  began to develop.  Khrushchev's increased dialog with western leaders also  facilitated long dormant communication between Soviet physicists and their  colleagues beyond the Iron Curtain.  Kurchatov's visit in 1956 was well  received at Harwell, the British power station.  From this small privileged  enclave, a civilizing influence was nurtured within a totalitarian society.   Eventually, Sakarov went beyond the usual misgivings of Soviet society to  become a dissident and human rights advocate.  <br />_Stalin_ concludes that  the arms race between the two blocks was contingent solely on Stalin's  intentions.  Holloway believes that in the post-war years the bomb probably  restrained the use of force but also made Stalin less cooperative to avoid  seeming weak.  <br />The book is not without flaws--some identifications to  the KGB presumably belong to NKVD, the American arsenal in June 1946 lists  a grossly exces-sive nine atom bombs taken from the _Bulletin  of_Atomic_Scientists_ compared to _The Winning_Weapon_ by Gregg Herken  which identified a single partially disassembled weapon in the inventory in  January 1947, and an annoying transliteration of two Cyrillic characters as  &quot;ia&quot; and &quot;iu&quot; instead of &quot;ya&quot; and  &quot;yu&quot; as more conventionally employed.  Otherwise, _Stalin_ is a  tremendous addition to our knowledge of Russian capabilities in physics  instigated by a repressive regime at the dawn of the nuclear age.	2000-06-03

I would give it 10 Stars if that were possible!<br />As a management consultant, I always begin assignments by asking our clients  what has worked well and what has not worked well with past assignments  that consultants have done for them.  Almost all of the problems are  associated with so-called experts who espoused a theory, had a few examples  of where the theory seemed to fit, and left the client with no idea of how  to use the advice.<br />Recently, I had a chance to read Simplicity, which  points out that most employees would love to implement new directions, but  they almost never receive the information, learning opportunities, or tools  to make it possible.  As you can imagine, this can lead to a lot of  frustration.  One of my hypotheses about why this occurs is because the  executives espousing the change don't know how to provide the information,  learning opportunities, or tools needed.<br />As someone who reads and reviews  a lot of business books, I am constantly struck by the flaws in the  arguments that the authors propose.  You can imagine how pleased I was to  see that Chris Argyris (one of the best management thinkers around) was  bothered by many of the same flaws.  You will get a chance to see obvious  errors in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey and  Managing Change by John Kotter, just to mention two examples from the  book.<br />Argyris argues that the authors of these flawed theories are  themselves unaware of the flaws.  Essentially, all useless management  theories have problems in one or more of these areas:  the executive is in  unilateral control of whatever is going to happen next (rather than letting  everyone participate in a meaningful way), the executive focuses on winning  instead of losing, the executive suppresses her/his negative feelings as  well as those of others, and action is based on rational principles.  The  result of this approach is to discourage communication, and to make  everyone feel defensive.  This habit reinforces two of the most common  sources of stalled progress in organizations.<br />Argyris proposes an  alternate approach which feature relying on valid information that can be  independently verified (99 out of 100 business books have no such  grounding); detailed information about what needs to be done; and free and  open discussion of the subject and process.  Books like Harnessing  Complexity and The Soul at Work would applaud these points as well.<br />Essentially, Argyris says that consultants and authors are proposing  command-and-control solutions based on rhetoric that the proposers do not  really believe in and apply themselves.  That's a pretty big indictment.  If you go back and read the early books on subjects like reengineering,  TQM, and Economic Value Added, look for the independently verifiable data,  encouragement for all to discuss, and directions for how each person in the  organization should apply the ideas.  If you are like me, you won't find  them.  Hmmmm!  Something to think about!<br />Argyris indirectly points out  that companies discourage people from raising fundamental questions, like  what are our objectives in this situation, how are we supposed to reconcile  conflicts, and how can we get back on track.  That's an essential part of  the stalled mindset like so concerns me in my writing and consulting.<br />In  fact, Argyris points out that success can reinforce complacency and  command-and-control management by creating the presumption that everything  the company does is perfect.<br />If you can learn to avoid and ignore  flawed advice, you'll be on your way to becoming an irresistible growth  enterprise!  A great step in that process is to help everyone in your  organization to learn ways to locate actions that will leave you better  off, regardless of what happens next with important forces beyond your  control.

Page 57, 4 ounces of peppermint eo in an 8# batch of  soap?                    Yikes, like taking a shower with an ice cube...   <br />                  OK, ok, so you're buying your essential oils at one of  these soap                   suppliers that buy low grade stuff and then  dilute it with DPG?  Okay,                   then pour that much, you'll  probably be fine.  Probably being an                   important word,  because if they don't care about quality when they                    purchase,they might get the occassional good batch and then you'll be                    hurtin'.<br />                  Oh,and she says to add 1/2 cup  dried peppermint leaf to the soap.                    Well, that is going  to turn brown, bleed, and look yucky.  There are                   much  better ways to get an herb into a peppermint soap, say, put                    something in there that stays green, for instance.<br />                  As  for the soap making method, it is exactly the same as your Ann                    Bramson book.  Which is about $4.95, and this one costs $9.95.  Well,                    except for Sandy Maine pours the lye INTO THE WATER!   Hurray!  First                   time I've seen the correct method in  print. :)  But she's saying to                   match temps at 95-98 F,  put a blanket on it, etc.  We know better                   now...  There  are MUCH easier ways. :)<br />                  She says to use a wooden spoon  to stir.  Don't ever do that.  Those of                   us who have will  tell you, the lye water eats the spoon and sooner                   rather  than later your spoon will break apart in your soap.  Wood                    splinter soap.<br />                  OK, here is my last complaint and then  I'll shut up.  Add 4 ounces of                   Rose oil, if you use 4  ounces of Rose essential oil and lets say you                   bought it  wholesale.  EACH BAR of soap will have about SIX DOLLARS of                    scenting material in it.  And that's before you figure your costs of the                    fats, lye, etc.  It'd be strong too, I'll tell ya that!<br />                   Don't even think of using that much Soapcrafters fragrance  oils either..                   oh yeah, I was going to shut up after that  last comment....<br />                  Recommended?  No, unless you're a soap  book collector, then buy it for                   the fun history stuff and  the few pic's.  I don't see anything                   particularly harmful  in there, I mean, your skin will just be a littleirritated by that cinnamon and for the next couple of hours people will                    be asking you if you have a sunburn.  Aside from that it is  okay.  Just                   seems like something she dashed off on a lazy  afternoon without much                   effort.  But the photos are  pretty. :)  And it is interesting to see                   photos of her  huge soap pot and her cutting press.	2000-05-25

Her biases are: she opposes adult men having sex with infants, she assumes that when a child screams and pushes her &quot;male partner&quot; away it  means that the child wants the man to stop, and she is repelled by  zoophilia (look it up).  I, too, was incredulous that Kinsey got away with  all of this pseudoscientific &quot;research&quot;, but he did.  Reisman  also exposes that his partner went on to found SIECUS, the Sex Information  and Education Council of the US, the leading consultant to school districts  on sex education today.  As far as Kinsey deserving a &quot;thoughtful and  unbiased&quot; reviewer - he has one in James Jones, his biographer.  But  the facts are facts, as Jones has verified.  Kinsey invented the &quot;10  %&quot; myth, so well known, and also was responsible for lightened  penalties on child sex offenders (he proved that kids &quot;ask for  it&quot;).  Kinsey's self-inflicted injuries speak volumes about his own  sex life, and there is not one single statement about Kinsey in Reisman's  book that is unverified by Kinsey or his associates.  I got his reports to  see what they were like, and Kinsey is his own best witness against  himself.  His use of psychopathic sex offenders as subjects guaranted that  he would get the data he wanted, and then he presented it as  &quot;normal&quot; male behavior.  If anyone wonders why sex education in  schools doesn't achieve stated goals, read this book, and you will come to  understand the problem. Thank you, Dr. Reisman - you are very courageous.	2000-05-20
US	49786731	R2YZHVZXKD8VC	1571780793	327012247	Twilight of the Clockwork God: Conversations on Science and Spirituality at the End of an Age	Books	3	23	33	N	N	Pretty title	Some of this is New Age babble of the most annoying sort, the usual concoction of pseudo science and nineteenth century vitalism.  Ebert, who conducts the \\"conversations\\" with eight current New Age illuminati that  form the bulk of the book, is a pretty fancy babble master himself, proving  without half trying that he can speak pseudobabblese with the best of them.  Consider this formulation as he converses with Rupert Sheldrake on page  46: \\"So your theory that information can be transmitted by these  non-material morphic fields makes plausible a paradigm in which phenomena  such as telepathy or ESP can be understood.  Can you explain how your  paradigm makes sense out of this type of phenomena?\\"<br />Note that Ebert is  incorporating into his talk scientific-sounding terminology shorn of any  scientific meaning.  It's a sort of sly of mouth that lends a \\"scientific\\"  gloss to the babbling.  Ebert's \\"non-material morphic fields\\" (from  Sheldrake), for example, sounds good since we have \\"field theory\\" in  physics.  Sheldrake chimes in with talk of \\"fields of perception.\\"  Note  especially, however, the killer word \\"paradigm.\\"  For the last couple of  decades or so, one way to test a book's BS content has been to count the  number of times the word \\"paradigm\\" appears.  Once every ten pages or so is  tolerable.  More than that should start your BS-detector to crackling.  New  Age babblers never use the word \\"construct\\" or \\"idea\\" or such a phrase as  \\"body of knowledge\\" when they can throw in \\"paradigm\\" instead.  In general  they like to spice up their discourse with a plethora of scientific  sounding words and phrases such as \\"psychokinetic influence,\\"  \\"fusion,\\"  \\"quantum events,\\" \\"cultural hybrids,\\" etc., as Ebert and Sheldon do on, for  example, page 48.  On pages 94 and 95, in the space of nine sentences,  Ebert manages to use the New Age shibboleth \\"resonance\\" six  times.<br />There's also the patterning of  words to imitate a reasoned  discourse, a weighing and choosing of plausibilities as though weighing  evidence or comparing experimental results.  Thus Sheldrake says on page  47, \\"...[S]ome...phenomena of parapsychology are hard to explain from the  point of view of morphic fields and morphic resonance.  For example,  anything to do with precognition or premonition doesn't fit into an idea of  influences just coming in from the past.  So, I don't think this is going  to give a blanket explanation of all parapsychological phenomena, but I  think it's going to make some of it, at least, seem normal rather than  paranormal.\\"  Notice how this mumbo jumbo makes it seem like something is  being explained.  Not all of this  is annoying, thankfully.  The conversation with psychedelic guru Terence  McKenna is interesting and invigorating, and the chat with Deepak Chopra is  uplifting and admirable, which is what New Age thought in general tries to  be.  The New Age movement itself, which is easy to make fun of (it takes  itself so seriously, I can't resist), is actually a noble enterprise  engaged in trying to free us from the shackles of antiquated religions and  the limitations of scientific materialism. The New Age in fact is a new  religion in the making.  In view of the stupidity and intolerance of some  world religions, this is a welcome development.  The problem is that many  New Age apostles in skirting scientific materialism, skirt the scientific  method as well.  Much of the conversation in this book wants to substitute  pronouncements for trial and error experiments.  Thus Sheldrake can  postulate morphic fields and morphic resonance, and continue on as though  such notions had been experimentally verified and independently confirmed.  And the terrible thing is I really don't think a lot of the New Agers  really know the difference between asserting something and presenting an  idea in a scientifically verifiable manner.  Ebert is perhaps aware of this  criticism because on page 92 he pays considerable homage to thescientific  method, but then continues on as if it didn't matter.<br />In short, this book  has a beautiful title, but it's a little after the fact since quantum  mechanics killed the clockwork god a long time ago.  Instead we have the  god who plays dice, a much more sophisticated god who can Be or Not Be in  the twinkling of a probability function.  To find out more about this god  we need  the kind of  speculation sometimes found in New Age thinking, but  more than that we need the scientific method, a process that Ebert and  friends would prefer to ignore.mage to the scientific  method, but then continues on as if it didn't matter.<br />In short, this book  has a beautiful title, but it's a little after the fact since quantum  mechanics killed the clockwork god a long time ago.

US	53075343	R2UKOHJKWYQFXB	0679435972	920269539	The Battle for God	Books	1	50	179	N	Y	There are better books on the topic. Disappointing.	The book describes historical activity of Christian, Jewish and Islamic fundamentalists opposing modernism in time-spans leading to present day.  Surprisingly, the book rarely explains what or why \\"fundamentalists\\" believe as they do. Nor are modernists clearly illuminated.<br /><br />Instead, it's a socio-political history of groups.  Group-X did this, then Group-Y did that, with each group treated as an unexplained black-box. There are occasional comments in passing like \\" ... they believed the Pope to be the Anti-Christ...\\" without explanatory background.<br /><br />I started by reading just sections on Christianity, something familiar. Found them so askew, didn't read about Judaism and Islam, since I would expect to be miseducated.<br /><br />There are so many problems with this book, I recommend avoiding it. Instead see \\"The Universe Next Door:A Basic Catalog of World-views\\"(Sire) and \\"How Now Shall we Live?\\"(Colson and Pearcy). Both books ably live up to the promise of deepening (revolutionizing?) your understanding of the modern world, without religious jargon. If you want to understand \\"fundamentalists\\", read something they might recommend, no?<br /><br />Problem#1: Use of term \\"fundamentalist\\". Don't know any orthodox people describing themselves with the word. It's a label (like \\"boogey-man\\") used by irreligious (media), to categorize and dismiss those they don't understand. Use here seems a marketing ploy to bring in PBS crowd (hi!).<br /><br />Problem#2: The author doesn't explain what SHE means by \\"fundamentalism\\" or \\"modernity\\" until the terms have been used dozens of times. You get 50-70 pages into the book before being able deduce the central issues under discussion.<br /><br />Problem#3: \\"fundamentalists\\" are finally(!) described as those whose beliefs are arrived at emotionally. \\"Modernists\\" are rationals who emphasize reason and the over-turn of tradition (she says). Thus the books' combatants are defined not by WHAT they believe, but HOW they believe.<br /><br />This conveniently allows the author to proceed without explaining the basis of belief. If she went into the whys and whats, she would end up falsifying the basic framework of the book, which is ...<br /><br />Problem#4: The division of understanding into \\"mythos\\" (truth by myth-story) and \\"logos\\" (rationality). The author says religious thought emphasizes myth, while modernity is reason. Very self-serving, very wrong.  Consider the following Enlightenment ideas \\"rational\\" Moderns are \\"logo\\"-ed into:<br /><br />1.\\"There are no absolutes\\". Comment:The statement claims absolute knowledge, thus contradicts itself.  Are there no absolutes or are there people who PREFER there be no absolutes, so they can do what they want?<br /><br />2.\\"We can't know anything with certainty\\". Comment:Except, it seems, this one belief. Which, being an example, is thus self-refuting and meaningless.  It asserts an absolute truth as it claims one is not possible.<br /><br />3.\\"There is no truth\\". Comment:If true, the statement is an example contradicting it's assertion. Another impossible idea that excludes itself.<br /><br />4.\\"Only empirically verifiable or falsifiable statements have any meaning\\". Comment: This idea cannot be verified and prohibits itself from being simply assumed true. It is thus impossible.<br /><br />Moderns, when they aren't congratulating themselves on their rationality, base it on impossible beliefs that can't be spoken without contradiction by the end of the sentence.<br /><br />Contrary to the author, this is a familiar story; modernity is not modern at all. It is as old as history, documented in Genesis, when humans freely chose to disobey God to gain worldy knowledge, to be their own little god. Educated Christians understand modernity in exquisite detail.<br /><br />Modernity seems new because consequences of that original sin can now be so widely and rapidly propagated with the printing press and television. There are vastly more ways to be inerror than to be correct. Mass media only leverage the broad path to error that has always existed.<br /><br />At one point the author actually talks about \\"Christian Utopia\\". For Christians, Utopia CANNOT POSSIBLY be created by human design because of the introduction of sin into the world (\\"The Fall\\"). Even phrasing the idea displays the books' profound ignorance (or willfull misrepresentation) of the subject.<br /><br />Utopianism IS modernity, made scientifically plausible by Darwin whose Victorian-era studies seemed to eliminate God, thus Original Sin. The result was predicted and predictable; Karl Marx quickly adopted Darwin's science, leading to communism and the attempt to perfect human nature scientifically, to create a Worker's Paradise (60 million killed in Russia, 50 million killed in China). Then come the Nazi's (National Socialists) trying to create an Aryan super-race, also based on the science of Darwin (20 million dead & Holocaust). And then eugenics and abortion: the modern world. Now, 140 years later, Darwin falls apart (\\"Darwin's Black Box\\",Behe).<br /><br />Biblical Christianity advocates the METHOD of science (comparison of observation with reality). It is the materialistic assumption of science PHILOSOPHY that is in error.<br /><br />The only reason humanist John Locke could think it \\"self-evident\\" that all humans have certain inalienable rights is because he lived in a culture permeated with the Christian idea Man was created in the image of God. Darwinism has no basis for human rights -- one reason they don't catch on in countries lacking a Christian background.<br /><br />This is the history of the secular world: ripping-off the culture of Christianity, distorting it, forgetting where it came from, then impugning the original basis of their very own adopted (now warped) secular beliefs. The book does this repeatedly.<br /><br />In original Greek, the Bible (John) says \\"In the beginning was the Logos...\\" (logic, or reason). It is saying God, and all He creates is based on reason. This was a radical idea to the old pagans, with their capricious, arbitrary gods.  It meant it was worth studying the world; it could be understood. Out of this came the scientific METHOD (completely biblical), education, literacy, and even the stunted off-shoots of Christianity-Now-Garbled: modern utopianism and atheism. Which, ironically, don't recognize the Christian tradition they totally depend on ... but which does not depend on them.	2000-05-16

Space is too limited to go into all the individual  errors, but just to let you see HOW important they are, here are a FEW  examples... a great deal of &quot;information&quot; Mr Posner gives us from  alleged witness interviews cannot be verified because Mr. Posner can  produce no notes nor can the individuals interviewed confirm the  interviews...his pg 479 illustration VIEW FROM ABOVE used to  &quot;prove&quot; the single bullet theory as viable, has Governor Connally  turned well to his right at Zapruder film frame 224...IF you'd take the  time to look at frame 224, you'd see Connally is sitting looking almost  straight forward...he places eyewitness Howard Brennan as sitting on the  wall looking directly at the TSBD, yet a review of the Zapruder film, in  which Brennan appears in several frames, has him facing HOUSTON St, not  Elm...even his testimony before the Warren Commission points this  out...makes me wonder if Mr. Posner viewed the film or read the  testimony...if he didn't, then his &quot;research&quot; is obviously  flawed; if he did, then he's lying...is this the book to &quot;close the  case?&quot; <br />If it is, I certainly hope Mr. Posner is never in a position  to prosecute me.<br />What we have is an educated man who, knowing that the  media...and government...would promote his book for him because of its  conclusions, is taking advantage and cashing in on the FACT that MOST of  the American public has not and will not ever attempt to verify if what he  SAYS is actually backed by the KNOWN FACTS and TESTIMONY, while at the same  time continuing to spread disinformation...much like what the Warren  Commission Report did over 35 years ago.<br />While I hate to help put even a  single additional penny in this carpetbaggers pocket, I will recommend that  you indeed buy this book...if you'll promise me, and yourself, that you'll  take his &quot;FACTS&quot; and compare them to the &quot;PRIMARY  SOURCES&quot;, NOT CONSPIRACY BOOKS, from which he supposedly obtained  them.

This is the memoir of a high ranking officer within the bodyguard administration of the Kremlin (Stalin's bodyguards).  The author is the only know member of Stalin's bodyguards know to have escaped to the West.   This book was published some 6 years after the author's death. The  interworkings of the dark side within Stalin's Kremlin is detailed.  The  book mainly details the Stalin Beria relationship and the author's  conclusions of how the ruthless Beria ultimately murdered Stalin.  A very  captivating and intriguing read, the book is filled with little known  details of the Stalin era and fills in the gap where other books leave out.   This book tackles the big issues-Stalin's death-by providing the knowledge  learned by the author, who was there.  Other works simply don't discuss  this.  As a memoir with an easy suspenseful read, history buffs must focus  on the details throughout the work.  The author does substantiate claims  made. The author clearly shows how Stalin was losing his power and  protection in the year prior to his death.  Beria's behind the scene  maneuverings and Stalin's own paranoia were responsible for much of  the  stripping of Stalin's protection. (The author even provides a list of those  fired or executed during Stalin's last months in chapter 14.)  Even on the  pages of Pravda Stalin was reduced to Secretary from General Secretary-as  Pravda had always printed-announcing that Stalin's position was weakening.   It is these significant facts added to the author's own experiences that  give new weight to Stalin's demise.  As far as I am aware, other works have  not mentioned this.  Another example is the author's revelation that Stalin  murdered his wife, and how he was almost removed as leader because of it.   The author then reveals that Stalin ordered the executions of all the  doctors who signed her death certificate (verified by other sources) to  cover his tracks.  That the gun used to kill her was Stalin's.  It is these  added details that give credence to the author's claims.  He goes beyond  other works. The author does not hesitate to address controversial areas.   After reading the author's first book, The Secret World, first published in  1959, which is a complete autobiography of the author that details his  extensive career in the KGB and the Communist Party, I understood the  terror that Stalin spread through his reign.  The author has written many  books about Russia and has used his experience from within to share with  his audience.  A gripping account of great historic value.  Highly  recommended.	2000-05-11

Two of the  Rescue Program scientists verified the seal was orphaned and took the sick,  malnourished pup to the Aquarium's hospital.

Design doesn't enter in until you've hacked yourself into a corner. While making bold claims, such as the claim  that the cost-curve for early versus late changes to a product is actually  flat (at least using XP), the key claims relied on in the book are never  verified or quantified in any manner. Another annoyance of the book is that  it seems to talk about *all* software development, but in actuality really  only ever deals with issues of concern to IT organizations. Granted, that  is a huge chunk of the industry, but the author never so much as  acknowledges other application areas. There are some good things in the  book, but only a very experienced engineer would be able to sort them out  from the rest.	2000-05-08

It is the in-depth story of how a boy named Ray Garraty must survive the greatest challenge of his life -- the Long  Walk. This annual event is summarized as follows: 100 boys start walking;  if you walk under 4 miles per hour, you get a warning; after 3 warnings, if  you slow down again, you are shot dead. The winner of the Long Walk is the  last boy left walking. <br />Stephen King (a.k.a. Richard Bachman) introduces  and develops the characters of many of the boys in the event. As a reader,  you get to learn about Garraty, Pete McVries, Hank Olson, Art Baker,  Barkovitch, Stebbins, and others, who each have their own personality  quirks and ways of looking at life. Each boy has entered the Long Walk for  a different reason and I found their discussions about life and death to be  quite interesting (a social statement by King, perhaps?). The reader is led  along the course and each significant event is mentioned along the way,  with some unexpected occurrences that may surprise you. <br />As the challenge  narrows down from the original 100 competitors to less than 50, then to  just a handful of boys remaining, the scenario becomes rather intense. Who  will die next? How will he die? And most importantly, who will be left at  the end to claim the Prize? Although the suspense builds slowly, it tends  to add to the dramatic effect of the final moments and keep the reader  wanting to read more to find out what happens (I was so eager to find out  that I read the last half of the book in one sitting). <br />Although the  story is interesting and held my attention, there are a couple of  criticisms that knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars. First, the ending was  too predictable. I had a feeling from the start of what would happen and  being verified at the end tended to downplay the whole story. Second, some  of the characters were killed off rather abruptly without muchdetail or  explanation. I guess it just depends on what you are expecting and how you  interpret the story. <br />Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed reading the  Long Walk. It tests the limits of human endurance in a unique way and makes  the reader think about life and death in a new light (or at least I did).  Unlike many of King's other novels, the Long Walk is more of dramatic  suspense story rather than a horror story, which is what I have noticed  about his writing as Richard Bachman. It is a good read, however, and I  recommend it to anyone, whether you are a fan of Stephen King or not.	2000-05-06

I think this book was an excellent idea, and could have been a complete success were it not for so many errors.  A beginner is going to have a dickens of a time figuring out why the programs don't compile.  He/She will  become frustrated. I feel fortunate to have many years experience writing  C, C++, Assembly Language programs etc, and troubleshooting and designing   complex electronic systems as an engineer and technincian.   It can be a  great excercise to figure out all the problems.   Not so for the beginner.   The beginner needs to have accurate material.  He/She is depending on the  authors and editors to provide a course that is reliable, tried, tested,  debugged and verified as to it's accuracy.   After all, the prospective  programming student when learning from the book, does not have an  instructor to call upon for help when problems arise.  This opinion stems  from the many frustrations I've had while using self study courses that  have been written poorly, while leaving much quality to be desired. Vincent  T.

He operated a saloon, ran a large ranch, acted as a Indian scout, and worked  mining claims.  He also  killed Mike Kileen over the affections of a woman.  Known by the Earps,  Leslie had a unique time in the Southwest including prison.  Chaput  provides the most complete study of the Leslie to date.  Well worth the  time for this interesting character.<br />One of the more respected writers in  the field, Chuck Parsons, Editor of the National Association For Outlaw And  Lawman History, was quoted in the Cow Country Courier(May 6, 1999):  &quot;His name is commonplace among Western buffs-Nashville Franklin  Leslie, best known as 'Buckskin Frank.'  Prior to Don Chaput's efforts he  was a myserious figure who had his moment of glory during the Earp days of  Tombstone and then started on the road downhill.  Thanks to the serious  research of Chaput, author of several books dealing with Arizona  characters, what can be verified about this historic figure is now  available.&quot;	2000-04-28

It recounts the story of one of the most successful frauds in modern science, and takes a look at the group of men who were behind the initial \\"discovery\\" and who supported it. The culprit has never been found,  but it is supposed that it must have been one of this group who first put  the elements in place, and triggered the find. <br />At the same time, this is  an interesting look at the state of palaeontology in the early part of the  twentieth century. It was due in part to the need for just such a \\"missing  link\\" that science found the so-called Piltdown Man so plausible. In  addition, the fact that \\"he\\" happened to turn up on British soil was  especially pleasing to the English school, which quickly took the  fragmentary evidence under its wing, and proclaimed it loudly. There are a  number of incidents related in the book, which make us wonder just how the  fraud could have continued for nearly fifty years, as it did. It gives us  pause to wonder about the veracity of any scientific assertion whatever,  given the interplay of human pride and greed that may be involved. One of  the participants in the initial story, who verified it and then supported  it to some extent, was the French philosopher and theologian, Teilhard de  Chardin. He was just one of several interesting characters who became  involved in the story, and probably helped to give it credence. <br />A very  good account by a writer who has also given us one of the most interesting  modern books about the King Arthur legend, although it seems to have been  completely overlooked. Don't hesitate to read either of these books if you  should stumble across them.	2000-04-24

Having purchsed annual copies of &quot;Lloyd's Register of American Yachts&quot; and later, &quot;The North American Yacht Register&quot;, for 20+ years, I was disheartened when they ceased publication.  A &quot;crooked&quot; doctor out of the Boston area promised to &quot;pick up the flag&quot; and publish the North American Registry again, but all he  succeeded in doing was bilking a bunch of us sailors out of a lot of money!<br />I was skeptical when Atle Moe started publishing the &quot;Stars  Register of Yachts, Clubs and Flags&quot;, but I ordered a copy.  It is  truly a labor of love.<br />It is about the same format as Lloyd's, i.e.  boat name, owner's info, club info and owner and club flags.

Unfortunately, the sheer volume of work keeping such a publication current,  overwhelmed Mr. Moe and his staff.

Mary Gordon's use of the language makes me able to read Men and Angels at a more measured pace than what I usually have == her phrasing is so precise and her scenes and  characters are jarringly familiar. <br />She describes the intensity of mother  love so well, how all consuming it is when your children are small, how  there's no question that you treasure them above life itself -- of course  they're more important than anything.<br />I love also the way she looks at  the mystery of how someone can be a good parent to one child but not  another. How bereft a child in such a situation feels, and how angry the  parent -- for not living up to such a basic requirement and instinct --  loving one's own child well enough. I also love the way she paints Laura,  the young babysitter whose mother hated her, who believes herself to be  beloved by God, who despises every adult except Anne, the book's central  figure, and who is clearly going to do something awful. Laura is so  despicable and so pitious at the same time that you don't know what to do  with her.<br />It's interesting that psychology has in recent years verified  Gordon's view, with the experts saying that yes, the personalities of  parents and children sometimes don't mesh, and can get in the way of a good  enough relationship. It's something that people took for granted in earlier  centuries, but in the past 100 years or so, of course it's unforgivable to  not love your children equally. <br />This is a wonderful book about love and  the human condition, and I'd be still reading it now except that I read for  the past hours on a Sunday afternoon, read until I'm seeing everything  double, and squinting to see the print.	2000-04-17
US	51020423	RINFPXRVLMQQZ	0553574426	557794403	Beyond the Darkness	Books	4	13	17	N	N	A Powerful NDE Account, but Appreciated with Skepticism	Let me first start off by saying that NDE accounts are not proof of a life-after-death existence.  There is no way that such experiences can be substantiated or verified - they are simply anecdotal evidence.  That being  said, of all the NDE accounts that I have read, this is one of the most  powerful.<br />Here is an account of a young woman who was raised in a family  with lots of problems, the outstanding ones being: 1) An alcoholic father,  2) a mother who abandoned the family, 3) an emotionally-abusive and  suicidal step-mother, and 4) childhood sexual abuse by unspecified persons  (which she stated was too horrible to go into details about).<br />After  Angie's very unhappy childhood, she got married to a military officer, whom  she traveled around with from Air Force Base to Air Force Base.  During her  marriage and the rearing of her young children, the horrors of her  childhood, and especially the ghastly childhood sexual abuse that she was  subjected to, came back to haunt her, especially at certain times of the  year that she described as &quot;the cycle&quot;.<br />Things finally came to  a head one day while the couple were stationed on Okinawa.  Angie attempted  suicide by swallowing a bottle of prescription medication and whatever else  was involved to poison herself.  Though she wished to enter the Light after  death, instead she found herself in a realm of darkness, characterized by  unimaginable fear and a total sense of disconnection and aloneness.  She  was among other suicides, who were in a stupor and incapable of responding  to any of her queries, as they were completely self-absorbed in whatever it  was that drove themselves to end their lives.  She found herself next to a  man who appeared to be sixty years old and dresses in the style one would  expect to see around the time Jesus lived on Earth.  This man was  completely dead, not even radiating negative thoughts.  It was at this  point that Angie realized that all hope had died in this real of  darkness.<br />She then heard a powerful voice rebuking her for taking her  life, and she found herself in the presence of God.  From the way she  described it, I suspect that the voice of God was communicated  telepathically, as opposed to our normal way of communicating via sound  waves.  This is probably so because of the fact that the others on the dark  plane didn't respond to God's voice.  God cut to the chase and didn't mince  words; He told her point-blank that suicide is not an option, that the  suffering that she would experience in this dark realm would be far greater  than what she suffered through in life.  Yet, thanks to the saving grace of  our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, she was redeemed from hell.<br />As someone  coming from a Christian perspective, I do question why it was that she saw  God the Father before seeing His Son, for Jesus does state in scripture  that He is \\"the Truth, the Way, and the Life\\", and that no one can go to  the Father but through Him.  On the other hand, God the Father was in the  realm of Light and Angie was in the realm of Darkness throughout the NDE,  so perhaps there is no scriptural violation here.  Another facet of her  experience that doesn't jive with the traditional Christian perspective is  the post-NDE revelation that she co-authored her life with God.  I question  this, for there is nothing in scripture that I'm aware of that states  explicitly that we have a spiritual pre-existence; yes, in Jeremiah 1:5 we  have the passage \\"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before  you were born, I consecrated you...\\".  Now this passage can be interpreted in  a number of ways, though I am aware that the Mormons do interpret this  passage to mean spiritual pre-existence, and Angie had exposure to the  Mormon church.  (NOTE: This is not meant to be an attack on Mormon beliefs,  but just pointing out how Angie's experiences may have been influenced.   Also, the myriad other interpretation of Jeremiah 1:5 are beyond the scope  of this review.)  As for me personally, I believe that we all came into  existence upon conception in the womb, for we are not eternal spirits; I  believe that God created us as mortals who die, and don't live forever, and  any after-life existence would be a gift given by His grace. <br />In closing,  I find Angie's NDE account to be very powerful, though I perceive some  scriptural flaws.  There is no way to substantiate her experiences, and I  remain the skeptic about any such things I read, intriguing as they may be.   As I stated at the beginning, NDE's are just anecdotes, and anyone can  concoct a good story.   I question how close she really was to death, given  that she didn't get any medical attention.  Whether she made-up this story  (which I doubt), or whether this was based upon some vision (probably  drug-induced), it was expressed in extremely powerful prose, and I guess I  was drawn to the sincerity expressed therein.  Nevertheless, my sympathies  and prayers go out to her, and in the end, what is most important is if  this experience (or whatever she went through) changed Angie's life for the  better, and that she no longer desires suicide as the way out.	2000-04-17
US	49694075	R271KAH1SN42C8	0029184673	103411614	Corporate Culture and Performance	Books	5	39	39	N	N	Academic, but practical, must-read book	Most popular and influential books on business management present the highly personal observations, interpretations, opinions, and conclusions of the author.  The author's tenets - often in the form of a \\"newly  discovered\\" business trend or critical success factor that business  executives can ignore only at their own peril - seem objective and  impersonal because they are supported by real-world examples that provide  strong evidence in their support.  Examples that do not support the premise  are conveniently ignored or dealt with in a cursory, simplistic  manner.<br />Basically, these books are the result of sharp minds drawing  conclusions from their own experience.  This approach is certainly valuable  and has contributed many valuable ideas about the various means of  improving business performance - and probably many more faulty notions that  have led management up the garden path.<br />John Kotter and James Heskett's  \\"Corporate Culture and Performance\\" sits at the other end of the spectrum  from this norm.  The book is in effect a report on their scientific  investigations of a hypothesis.  The authors set out a number of hypotheses  and then test them against the hard data of long-term business performance.   In doing so, they present solid insights into some of the conventional  wisdom spouted by management consultants and authors of business  books.<br />The fundamental source of their hypothesis is the question \\"What  is the relationship between corporate culture and business performance?\\"   The fruits of their research yield important observations on the nature of  this relationship.<br />The authors' well-structured research study, and their  sharp analytical abilities permit them to trek deep into the jungle of  issues surrounding corporate culture.  By speculating and then testing  their notions against the research data, they uncover some insights that  might be undervalued because they seem so intuitively obvious.  One of  these is central to thebook, namely that \\"adaptive\\" cultures - ones that  help organizations anticipate and adapt to environmental change - are the  most effective at helping a company achieve good long-term financial  performance.<br />If the book and - more important - the research were not  infused with the analytical skills of the authors, the book would leave the  reader with a great many empirically verified observations about culture  and management and an understanding of the key issues, but with no  practical way of dealing with the issues.<br />However, the authors have a lot  to offer in the way of practical tips.  For example, in presenting a  fundamental dilemma, they follow it up with a research-tested approach for  dealing with the issue:<br />\\"Holding onto a good culture requires being both  inflexible with regard to core adaptive values and yet flexible with regard  to most practices and other values....And it requires providing strong  leadership, yet not strangling or smothering delicate leadership  initiatives from below....<br />\\"...executives need to differentiate basic values  and behaviors that aid adaptation from the more specific practices needed  to perform well today.  This distinction needs to be made explicit when  talking about culture...although executives need to foster pride among  employees, they also must be as intolerant as possible of arrogance in  others and in themselves.  They need to confront, and make others confront,  as many of their failings as is practical.\\"<br />In spite of its many  qualities, it is easy enough to see why the book isn't likely to top any  best-seller lists.  In many places it reads too much like a doctoral  thesis, severely limiting accessibility.  The academic lingo - \\"Within the  limits of this methodology, we conclude from this study....\\" - and the  occasional embalming of the text in footnotes don't add to the readability,  and certainly don't lend the text the \\"personality glamour\\" that appeals to  the mass-cult audience of best-sellers.<br />However, the writing does have  style and a dry humor, and - above all - important empirically verified,  occasionally illuminating facts that business people would be better off  knowing and using, rather than stumbling along in the dark.	2000-04-17
US	53038410	R206PWHCPQNH0F	0425174077	218502613	The Case of the Missing Neutrinos	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Covers lot of territory, but not in detail	This is a nice little book with 17 chapters and not quite 250 pages.  Each chapter is typically between 10 and 20 pages long, and reads more like an in-depth article that you might find in the science section of a  better-than-average newspaper.  These are high-level discussions for the  intelligent and informed &quot;man on the street.&quot;  As such, there are  no equations.  Unfortunately, there are no figures, illustrations,  pictures, charts, or tables, either.  <br />The title describes the case of  the missing neutrinos - referring, of course, to the fact that the flux of  solar neutrinos found in experiments is only about 1/3 the flux predicted  by the standard solar model, under the assumption of zero neutrino mass.   The book, though, discusses lots, lots more than just the missing neutrino  problem.  This is a collection of short essays on issues of primary  interest to physics - the hot topics of the day.  The book is a joy to read  - I bought it for the trip from Portland to Newark, and read it in just a  few hours.<br />Chapter 1 consists of speculation regarding the likelihood of  intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and how likely it is that any  such extraterrestrial civilizations might count with, say, base eight  instead of base 10.  It's interesting to compare Gribbin's assumptions and  prejudices regarding the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations in  light of Ward's recent book, &quot;Rare Earth.&quot;  The idea of  intelligent extraterrestrial life is also extended in chapter 2, which also  includes a very brief and simplistic discussion of the history of life on  earth.<br />Chapter 3 reviews the evidence for the Milankovitch cycles, which  are associated with ice ages on earth.  The chapter predicts that the next  ice age is imminent, but does not include speculation about how the current  dumping of carbon dioxide and other &quot;green house gases&quot; might  affect its onset.   If you enjoy chapter 3, you'll also want to read&quot;Ice Ages,&quot; by John Imbrie and Katherine Palmer Imbrie.  You may  also want to read &quot;Is the temperature rising,&quot; by S. George  Philander.<br />Chapter 4 is a real gem.  It's called, &quot;How Darwin  Discovered Relativity.&quot;  It's an historical recantation of how  biologists discovered, through their study of the earth and evolution, that  the earth is many thousands of millions of years old.  However, at the time  there was no known way to keep the sun shinning for that long.  It drove  everyone nuts, and resulted in some pretty interesting ideas - all  classical, about how to provide earth with heat and life long enough for  species to evolve the way they have.   Eventually, of course, physicists  discovered the energy released in atomic fusion, and that solved the  problem.  It's a great little chapter that illustrates how progress in one  branch of science can stimulate progress in other branches.<br />Chapter 5  finally gets down to the book's title by introducing the fact that the sun  does not seem to be emitting the flux of neutrinos that the standard solar  model says it should.  Gribbin introduces several possibilities, including  the notion that neutrinos could have finite mass (in which case they can  oscillate from one type to another) and the idea that solar cycles may  result in the temperature dropping within the sun's core (blinking on and  off) and thus modulating the flux of neutrinos.   Gribbin develops these  concepts over several chapters (5, 6, and 7), and includes some fine  information about the history of measurements of the sun's diameter, and  the solar cycles that result in the size and luminosity of the sun  oscillating over time.<br />Chapter 8 is a fine summary of what happens in a  super nova.  Again, this is all very qualitative, and many details are  omitted, but Gribbin does a nice job of presenting the salient issues  involved in super novae and also gives some nice historical information and  context.Chapter 8, for example, illustrates super novae by describing SN  1987A.  If super novae interest you, check out &quot;The Supernova  Story&quot; by Laurence A. Marschall.<br />Chapter 9 is another one that I  truly enjoyed.  This chapter is mostly an historical accounting of the  discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell.  It also includes some of the  historical highlights of Thomas Gold's explanation of pulsars as rotating  neutron stars.<br />The rest of the book deals mostly with cosmology.  Chapter  10 talks about galaxy formation, chapter 11 is an historical account of how  Eddington verified the general theory of relativity by measuring the  gravitational bending of starlight.  Chapter 12 is about the early  predictions of dark stars based on analysis done within the framework of  Newton's theory of gravitation, and the interesting idea that black holes  were really invented (discovered?) hundreds of years ago, long before the  observational evidence for their existence came about.<br />Chapter 13 touches  on some pretty controversial stuff about white holes and Narlikar's theory  of the steady-state universe.  Chapter 14 is called &quot;Time and the  Universe.&quot;  It's really about the second law of thermodynamics, and  attempts to use that, along with ideas in quantum mechanics, to explain  time's arrow.  Chapter 15 is a quick summary of white dwarfs, neutron  stars, black holes, and wormholes, and why empty space does not weigh  billions of tons per cubic centimeter.  The book ends with a chapter on  particle physics and a final chapter on inflation.  <br />As I said, I read  this book on a trip to New Jersey.  While I was there I visited the horn  antenna used by Arno Penzias and Bob Wilson when they inadvertently  stumbled across the microwave background radiation that confirmed the  &quot;big bang&quot; theory of the origin of the universe.  It seemed a  fitting end to the journey Gribbin took me on with his book.	2000-04-14

In fact, the writing is so beautiful that you scarcely realize that you are reading at all.  Sobel's  skills produce a window, which the observer looks through to get a view of  life in the 17th century.  It is, of course, about Galileo, but no less  about his devout daughter and their devotion to each other.  As a Catholic,  I appreciate the respect given the Church and the many Catholics, clergy  and others, who defended and supported Galileo in his struggle with his  former friend, the vainglorious Pope Urban VIII.  Sadly, what other critics  seems to miss is that it was not &quot;the Church&quot; in her position of  teacher of faith that condemned Galileo.  It was a group of powerful,  small-minded, and envious Church officials who pursued him, as Sobel  explains in great detail.  It should also be noted that it was many  academicians, fellow &quot;philosopers&quot;, mathematicians, astronomers,  and the like who made Galileo's life miserable with their envious attacks  and stubborn refusal to objectively evaluate new information that would  force them to change their teaching.  As to the comparison with modern  teaching on evolution, it doesn't exist.  The Church's official position on  evolution is that it is a proper field of study - no more and no less.   Additionally, evolution as Darwin has proposed it has been soundly  challenged by religious, atheistic, and agnostic scientists alike,  particularly in the fields of biochemistry and genetics.  Challengers are  treated like wild-eyed fundamentalists, whether atheist, religious or  otherwise. It is as if any evidence which fails to support Darwin must  point to the existence of a Creator-God, which it does not necessarily do.   (This happened also when the big-bang theory was verified, and many  scientists were reluctant to publish the verification of it because of its  theological implications.)Galileo's critics in the academy are more like  modern scientists who cling tenaciously to Victorian science than they are  to members of the Church, many who are prominent scientists themselves.   For those who think John Paul II should apologize for past Catholic crimes,  he already has.  Now how about an apology from a prominent atheist for past  ridicule of the Church for saying that the universe had a beginning and was  not &quot;infinite&quot;, or for the fiasco of the &quot;Piltdown  Man&quot;, which made virtually every contemporary Darwinist look like  gullible morons?	2000-04-11

Moreover, it  does not present and support a thesis, nor even provide a cohesive  narrative, but hops about with abandon in space and time. That said, it is  still a useful book - but one to be read with caution. <br />For example, the  date for the destruction by earthquake of St. Michael's church is given as  1275 on one page, and 1276 on the next. What difference does a year make?  Not much, granted, but if the author and editor did not catch variant dates  a single page apart, one wonders how carefully they scrutinized the rest of  the book. The name &quot;Cadiz&quot; appears on the first line of a  paragraph, but as &quot;Cadis&quot; within the same paragraph. Moreover,  the typography clearly shows that the first instance was corrected by the  insertion of &quot;wrong font&quot; letters. <br />Historians cannot support  their theses by appealing to &quot;Many Biblical scholars&quot; or to  un-named &quot;Experts&quot;, but must do so by citing sources which can be  verified. This book does so all to infrequently, and when it does, it fails  to comment upon the authority of its sources. Should we lend the same  weight to the apocryphal &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot; and the canoncal  one of Mark? Perhaps yes, perhaps no - we expect authors to help us decide  when and if. <br />One finds it hard to believe that the island  &quot;strong-bold&quot; (sic) community of Glastonbury, for which we are  given an &quot;artist's conception&quot;, could simultaneously have been so  compactthat it could hold only a few dozen huts, and have raised herds of  horses and cows and grown many vegetables. If that happened on the  mainland, why not say so? Examples of bronze age artefacts are plentiful in  the book, but the author cannot claim that, as he implies, the items in the  pictures were all made at Glastonbury. <br />We are shown a &quot;Jesus  Well&quot; in Cornwall, with the suggestion that Christ replenished His  ship's stores there. Well, there's a St. Paul's in London. Should we  conclude that the Apostle was there? <br />We do not know where Jesus spent  His teens and twenties. But the author does not distinguish between the  tradition that He did so in Britain, and the evidence pro or con.  That  Phoenecian sailors probably mined metals in Britain does not mean that  Jesus and Joseph of Arimathea sailed there hundreds of years later - it  means that it was technically possible for them to do so. The fact that the  18th Century poet Blake wrote a beautiful hymn based on the tradition tells  us much about the persistence of the legend, but nothing about its  historical veracity. <br />The Druid Trinity may have included a person whose  name sounded like &quot;Jesu&quot;, and mediaeval scholars might well have  seen this as a prefigurement of Christ, but the author's contention that  Christianity would not have been possible without the Druids is plain  silly.<br />Read the book because of the fine examples, the many pictures and  maps, the pleasure of speculation, and to learn the traditions themselves,  but do not accept the inferences and conclusions blindly.	2000-04-07

Interesting, because the author offers some thought-provoking insights into the history of the Broadway musical and where it has arguably gone wrong in its modern form.  One may or may not  agree, but there are enough new ideas to set you thinking.  <br />Irritating,  because it's riddled with factual inaccuracies, even on simple matters.   \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" is in a major, not minor, key.  \\"One for the Gipper\\"  is not from \\"a biopic of the baseball player George Gipp\\", it's from a  biopic of the football coach Knute Rockne.  These are not isolated  instances, and cause one to distrust the accuracy of facts less easily  verified.<br />Further irritating, because it aims at musical pretension with  lots of technical terms (including the British use of words like \\"crotchet\\"  and \\"quaver\\"), but quotes melodies not by printing the music, but by  representations like \\"Da-da-dee-dum\\".  The author knows far less about  music than he wants the uninitiated reader to think.<br />In short, this is a  fun book to read, but prepare to be cross with the author at frequent  intervals.	2000-04-04

I have been a believer in Jesus Christ for many years. If there is one thing I have learned as a believer in Jesus Christ that is to keep your eyes on Him and not on man. Through the reading of this book I have discovered many  valuable truths about Pastor Aguilar. He is a man made of flesh and bone  just like you and me. He is not perfect just like you and me. Jesus chose  Phil Aguilar just like he chose the Apostle Paul from an evil murderer to a  servant of His for good.God has allowed Pastor Aguilar to bring His written  Word of peace and restoration to His people. God has allowed Pastor Phil to  feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty,clothe the naked, visit the sick  and those in prison. God has allowed him to bring whole families back  together again.I myself have been allowed to be one of the people that God  used Pastor Aguilar to restore. I have never read one article that has been  written about Pastor Aguilar nor do I care to. His life truths on paper has  verified what I have been taught from the beginning &quot;Keep my eyes on  Jesus&quot;. This is what I have learned from my Pastor, Pastor Phil. I  know these things because I have lived at Set Free Christian Fellowship and  have seen with my own eyes. I have experienced for myself the life of  Pastor Aguilar. Matthew 25 for those that read the Bible or just pick one  up out of curiosity and you will find that Jesus is going to say to Pastor  Aguilar: Come you blessed of My Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you  from the foundation of the world.Keep your eyes on Jesus and you too may be  included one day in truth of Jesus just as Pastor Aguilar.

The authors span history and provide profiles of the life and crimes of the most notorius killers and mass murderers, focussing upon government leaders  and crime lords throughout history. Hitler and the Nazi's, Pol Pot, the  Ottoman Sultans, Caligula, Idi Amin, Stalin, Ivan the Terrible, the  Borgias, the Conquistadores, sea pirates, Marat, Jim Jones, the Mafia crime  lords amongst others all have individual chapters written about them. The  book describes their crimes but rarely seeks out the motivation behind the  crimes. There are several photographs and drawings included. The book is  quick, entertaining reading, though it is gory. My criticisms of the book  deal with the writing style. Many quotes are attributed to Caligula and  others when there is no way a quote could be verified. Descriptions of some  actions in private encounters could never be verified either. There is a  yellow journalism tone throughout the book, but still it makes for a quick,  interesting read.	2000-04-02

Lucky me! This turned out to be the best ten bucks invested in my trip to Hawaii. This book is small enough to carry in your pocket, yet is chock full of  detail. I was impressed when I took a trip to the southern edge of Maui  solely relying on this book. Every shop, corner, and area of Maui matches  the description in this book. It is very accurate and upto date. The tips  included by the authors were very helpful. When we wanted to mail coconuts  from Maui and were really lost, this book helped. A few hints for Maui  travelers: some USPS offices in Maui have officers dressed in Hawaiian  attire, so do not be confused and doubt if it really is a post office guy  when you see him dressed like a Hawaiian beach bum! If you go to the  southern edge of the island, you can actually buy coconuts at the post  office and mail 'em too. Permanent markers that you use to address coconuts  are awfully hard to find, so pack a Sharpie with your stuff! Overall, if  there is just one travel guide you'd buy, pick this one. The book's binding  is very good, and it held up after all the beating around and abuse that  was showered on my copy. Don't let the small size fool you--this one is  very detailed, and more importantly, very accurate (verified by us in Jan  2000). Highly recommended.	2000-03-28

It is a topic most people have pondered, though few  investigate the science behind it. Anyone interested by fantasies of time  travel will be even more interested to learn that modern physics does not  exclude the possibility of it. Cosmic Time Travel describes current  scientific theories of time in easily \\"understood\\" terms. (The word  understand is used loosely; certainly no one fully understands the nature  of space-time!) This book is easily accessible even to people with no  background in physics. The concepts of Cosmic Time Travel are very  interesting and thought-provoking, but I should mention that, although  Relativity has been experimentally verified, applications for time travel  are speculative. (In other words, no get too excited about the prospect of  time travel yet.) Even if wormholes and exotic matter (you'll find out when  you read this...) would serve the purpose, current technology is no where  near being capable to produce such a device. Parker concludes that hope for  time travel rests in super-civilizations in a far greater stage of  development than our own. (He seems moderately confident of their  existence, although I myself find it highly doubtful.) Still, time is a  fascinating concept, and this book is wonderful if you are looking for  something to exercise your brain. If you find physics interesting, you'd  probably like this book. If you don't find physics interesting, you  probably would after reading this book. Of course, there are other books on  this topic besides Cosmic. Black Holes and Time Warps contains basically  the same information, also well explained, and is really a better deal.	2000-03-28

His noncoventional approach, which involved follow-up interviews on published case histories, is noteworthy.  However, I'm still a skeptic on this hypothesis, and I think everyone still  should be. <br />In sharp contrast to the 27 arguments FOR the OPV/AIDS  hypothesis that he stated, it is interesting that all these can be summed  up into two: <br />1. A LOT of chimpanzees (to around 400) were used for  safety-testing the Koprowski vaccine strains in an area where the first  mass-CHAT vaccinations and AIDS cases were noted (including the  sequence-verified isolate from 1959 in Leopoldville). <br />2. No existing  records were found to shed light on the origin of KIDNEY cells used for  attenuation of the vaccine (CHAT), and it is POSSIBLE that chimp kidneys  MAY have been used due to its availability, and scientific merit (closer to  humans, higher virus titers, etc). <br />In contrast, there are at least 3  reasons to doubt the hypothesis:<br />1.  It has never been proven that SIVcpz  can withstand the vaccine manufacturing process. In all likelihood all  infectious virions would have been removed. Cell-free HIV is extremely  labile. This then only leaves the issue of infection via cell-associated  virus. How long can macrophages/T cells survive the process? How many  infected cells could have been there in the kidney MONOLAYER? Experiments  to shed light on this issue should have been done first before this  hypothesis was released to the public. (But then again, the reluctance of  the vaccine makers to send samples for testing could've pushed Hooper to  this end). <br />2. Assuming host-dependent evolution exist for SIVcpz, the  precursor of HIV-1 may not have come from this area, since only  schweinfurthii chimps abound. The HIV-1 isolates group together with SIVcpz  from the troglodytes subspecies, which are found in Cameroon, Gabon and  Congo-Brazzaville. The specific boundaries of these 2 subspecies remain a  matter of dispute and remains at the heart of this debate. In any case, the  geographic coincidence of SIVcpz and the HIV-1 Group N viruses (Cameroon)  effectively ABOLISHES the OPV/AIDS hypothesis for this HIV-1 group. The  story for HIV-1 Group M, the main group responsible for the pandemic,  remains open until new viruses are discovered in both subspecies -- a  difficult task considering how endangered these animals are. To date,  however, HIV-1 Group M viruses remain MORE closely related to SIVcpz from  the troglodytes subspecies. <br />3.  A recent molecular clock study using 512  nodes from Nirvana, the supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory  (unpublished as of now) extrapolates the chimp-to-human transfer in the  1930s +/- 25 years, which is effectively BEFORE the CHAT feedings in  Africa. Although this is based on several assumptions, the model was able  to correctly predict the timing of the L70 isolate (1959) and isolates from  Thailand (1986). <br />This leaves us with the question: What would testing of  the remaining vaccine lots do to resolve this hypothesis? <br />Finding  nothing remains the likely scenario, since the vaccines were stored for  almost 3 decades now. The fact that it took so much effort to PCR-amplify  sequence FRAGMENTS from the L70 isolate (1959) FROM PLASMA, where virus is  usually found, makes it hard to envision that a virus will be detected from  the vaccine preparations, where one would think the virus will be present  in very few amounts (if it's even there!). With mitochondrial DNA typing  for species determinations it is more hopeful -- but if it turns out to be  a chimp of the schweinfurthii subspecies (if it's not rhesus monkey!) --  what does it prove? <br />All in all, Hooper has done a great deal of work to  re-spark this debate which has a lot of implications to future public  health policy. Although he tends to protect his hypothesis more so thanthe  other (even to the point of extrapolation towards HIV-2!), it remains to be  a critical documentary of the modern plague, and the need to  test/de-bunk/accept controversial hypotheses. Will this hypothesis cloud  the natural transfer theory and its very important implications -- that  there are many other SIVs in different monkeys out there just waiting to  jump to humans at the right opportunity? How elaborate should this human  intervention be (e.g., OPV versus hunters) to facilitate this process?  <br />In conclusion, I am impressed with the magnitude of research Hooper has  incorporated in this work, however, I'm not casting a vote for the OPV/AIDS  hypothesis yet. The implications are just too shocking to even BEGIN to  accept it point-blank.	2000-03-26

He was in the pentagon's foreign technology division and he was a military liason to the Eisenhower white house administration.  A man of his stature and military experience  would simply not be prone to making up stories.  Anyone who has experience  with the honor and integrity someone who has risen to the rank of Lt.

The NT remains a backwater of injustice  to this day - most often directed towards Aborigines, but also, as  demonstrated here, with invective directed towards another group outside  the conventional mainstream.<br />The media reported in the most outrageously  biased and one-sided fashion, and actually whipped up the populous into a  frenzy of finger-pointing, gossiping hatred toward Mrs Chamberlain.<br />I am  not at all religious, but to my mind Seventh Day Adventism doesn't even sit  far outside the mainstream Christian tradition, yet we were encouraged to  believe it was some sort of devil-worshipping Jim Jones type sect.<br />Eventually the government was forced to recognise the veracity of the  Chamberlain's story. ironically, another person died on The Rock for the  essential clue to be discovered - a tourist fell off and his body was found  near the baby's matinee jacket. It is almost beyond belief the lengths the  authorities went to to balme the parents, when most of the people closest  to the event on that night verified or supported the Chamberlain's case.  Yet those voices were drowned out for years.<br />Bryson did a wonderful job  of bringing this story to public atttention,and some of the most important  parts were effectively translated to the screen in the Meryl Streep movie  (Cry In The Dark).	2000-03-21

And this is the virtue of the author  for appraching the most important scientific subject of the millenium. Any  personal compromise with mainstream scientific professional institutions  would have worked against the simple and shocking objetivity of the book in  depicting events that require a complete overhaul of our more cherished  scientific assumptions about  the physical substratum of consciousness. As  the author describes through his dialogues with  Stevenson and others we  are in a loss of explaining at last two aspects of the cases  showed in the  book: a)What are the biological:spacetime, termodynamic, electromagnetic  and complexity measures of the hypothetical entities that are necessary to   postulate for understanding the &quot;transitions&quot; between  personalities? b)Why the curious differences (even in the better cases)  between the memories of some facts about previous personalities and the  facts verified  during the stage of research?.

The models are so realistic and detailed that I had to check the introduction to make sure that they were not actual preserved specimens.  Almost every page is dominated by a single high-quality photo of a wax  model of some part of human anatomy, and there are 700 pages. There is very  little text and almost no naming of the details within a single photo, just  a title (giving the scientific names of the major features being  illustrated) and brief caption describing the whole model. So this is not a  substitute for an anatomy book (though it would make a great companion).  Every part of anatomy that I can think of is well-represented, usually by  many sculptures showing different layers and cutaway views - brain, heart,  lungs, skeleton, eyes, sexual organs, cutaway views of stages of pregnancy,  the different parts of the digestive system, musculature, incredibly  detailed networks of blood vessels, inner ear, and many groups of different  body parts to show how they fit together. My one criticism of the book is  that I wish it had a larger format. I have verified the dimensions stated  by Amazon, which are 7.87 x 5.70 for the version that I am reviewing.	2000-03-20

He writes in a style that combines trenchant lucidity with mastery of exposition.  Even the subtlest and most confusing  intricacies of human nature are rendered easily accessible by Wilson's deft  and engaging pen.  He is especially good at providing apt metaphors to  illustrate what might otherwise be difficult scientific conceptions.   Behavioral tendencies in human nature are described, for example, as  various channels, some of which are shallow (and can therefore more easily  be overcome), while others are much deeper (and therefore much more  resistant to efforts to counteract them).  As befitting a man of science,  Wilson supports his views, not with abstruse argumentation, but with facts  collected and verified by practicing scientists.<br />Yet despite the solidity  of Wilson's research, when \\"On Human Nature\\" first came out, it was  viciously attacked by left-wing ideologues who violently disagreed with  Wilson's conclusions regarding the limitations of man's nature.  The Left,  of course, wants to believe that human nature is largely fluid and  malleable.  Man, leftists argue, is the product, not of genetics or  biology, but of social conditions, which can be changed.  Under a \\"just\\"  society, human nature would become transformed and evil would virtually  disappear from the world.  Wilson's \\"On Human Nature\\" thoroughly demolishes  all these sterile hopes for man's secular salvation.  Using scientific  evidence, he demonstrates that most human behavior is genetic (or related  to or influenced by genetics) and therefore unalterable.  The sociologist  Vilfredo Pareto has probably described this view of man most trenchantly  when he wrote: \\"The centuries roll by, and human nature remains the same!\\"   In \\"On Human Nature,\\" Wilson shows us why Pareto is right.	2000-03-18

For Lincoln was an out-of-size character whose  personality and achievements were instrumental to the shaping of modern  American society.  This book is part breezy travelogue and part  under-researched biography.  It is not a great book, it contains too many  factual errors, and the author's understanding of nineteenth century  American history is too shallow for this effort to find a place on the  shelf of the serious Lincoln scholar.  For example, Ms. Morris writes that  the Mason-Dixon line came about in the 1820s as a product of the Missouri  Compromise, whereas in reality it was surveyed sixty years earlier.  She  cites well-known and easily-verified quotations inaccurately, she accepts  discredited Lincoln legends at face value, and perhaps worst of all she  misunderstands the fundamental meaning of the Gettysburg Address.  Yet, for  all that, the book is a likeable one.  Morris is up-front about her  prejudices, airily unconcerned about her lazy research methods, and  frequently contradictory in her opinions and conclusions.  By the end, she  must admit that she doesn't quite know what to make of Lincoln, although  she frequently evinces affection and respect for him.  This is not a  serious book, but it is fun, particularly for the many readers whose  understanding of Lincoln is greater than Morris's, and who will enjoy  revisiting him with fresh eyes.	2000-03-15

But my experience is that many other people have made it a daily way of life with marvelous results  in health, harmony and well being.<br />Ms. Kramer's main thesis is that  Christian Science is a form of mind control.  Nothing could be farther from  the facts.  This religion teaches that individuals have the right and the  ability to turn to God directly and to think for themselves and make  decisions they deem best for themselves and their loved ones.  At the very  beginning of the book, &quot;Science and Health with Key to the  Scriptures,&quot; author Mary Baker Eddy, states, &quot;The time for  thinkers has come.&quot;  And the rest of the book encourages independent  thinking.<br />Which would be the more useful book about house building: one  written by someone who never completed a house, or one by a successful  contractor? Ms. Kramer candidly admits her inadequacy as a Christian  Science healer yet purports to explain its teachings.  She also is very  critical of the church and some of its current activities, yet never became  part of it by becoming a member.  Would her critique be representative?   Those interested in find out for themselves might stop by a Christian  Science Reading Room to explore &quot;Science and Health&quot; on their own  or read any of the 60,000-plus verified, published accounts of physical and  mental healing and of lives restored and enriched.  Readers can be their  judge of the practicality and validity of this teaching.<br />A student of  Chrsitian Science in Michigan	2000-03-09

US	51217825	R260WN3Z2XWILU	0761520570	746070341	The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire	Books	1	8	23	N	N	Pseudo history by a pseudo historian	This book falls largely into the category of \\"popular\\" history, meaning that it is geared for a mass audience.  History books of this type are a good thing, provided that they are accurate and based on fact.  _The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire_ is neither, however.  It is worth noting that Crozier worked for the secretive \\"Information Research Department\\" (IRD), a disinformation service tied to British Intelligence.  The task of this organization was to \\"spin\\" information gathered from the USSR and Eastern Europe into anti-Soviet propaganda, and pass the resulting half-truths and (in some cases) outright fabrications along to top Western journalists.<br />True to his roots, Crozier now applies the same methods of the IRD to writing this book.  Drawing selectively from Soviet archival data, he twists and embellishes his facts in such as way as to present the Soviet Union in the worst light possible.  Sometimes even this does not suffice, however, and his more preposterous claims are left unverified.  Interestingly, the IRD is also the same organization that spawned Robert Conquest, whose works are more academic than Crozier but are often equally guilty of skewering the facts, drawing irresponsible conclusions, and deceiving readers by blending established fact with undocumented fiction.  Whether in the guise of a historian or journalist, Crozier must be seen for what he is: a propagandist.<br />Politically slanted history is not uncommon and has is its place, but _The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire_ is just plain bad history, and has rightly been ignored by the mainstream press.  Most current history books sold on Amazon.com are usually accompanied by several editorial reviews by major publications.  This one is an exception, however, featuring only brief lines of praise from half-forgotten Cold Warriors, far-right figures in the media, and like-minded academics.<br />The first few pages of his introduction show that Crozier is still fighting the Cold War.  He desires to extract reparations from the ex-Communist states (a laughable suggestion since Western banks would have to loan them the money to do so), as well as put former officials of these countries on trial (also foolhardy since many of those men are now servants of democratically elected governments which have joined NATO).  He repeats these themes in his conclusion.  Crozier is clearly alarmed that the people of Eastern Europe have often chosen to elect former Communists back into power rather than continue to endure the corrupt and incompetent administrations of men like Poland's Lech Walesa and Lithuania's Vytautas Landsbergis, whose main accomplishments while in office were to create popular nostalgia for the socialist past.<br /><br />Crozier goes to such extremes that a comparison with the Stalinist line he despises so much is unavoidable.  Take, for example, his claim in a footnote on page 287 that most of the victims of the McCarthy witch-hunts \\"were proved later to have been, indeed, working for the Soviet side.\\"  This is an outrageous statement, similar to those made by apologists for Stalin who say that most of those imprisoned or executed in Stalin's \\"Great Purge\\" of 1936-38 were, in fact, guilty.  Crozier's description of the 1965 coup in Indonesia (pg 257) is not so much outrageous as it is chilling.  He does not deny the massacre of 300,000-500,000 (a very conservative estimate) people in an anti-Communist military takeover, but the only description given of the principal leader of this slaughter, General Suharto, is that he was \\"a man of cool nerve, caution, and natural political skill.\\"  Imagine the disgust a similar statement about Stalin's \\"cool nerves\\" or \\"natural political skill\\" would produce if used in connection with, for example, his decision to execute some 15,000 Poles in 1940.<br />The book is packed with similar outrages, such as this passage on page 139 describing British treatment of the largely pro-Communist Chinese minority inMalaysia's independence struggle, \\"[the British leadership] introduced drastic methods to resettle Chinese villagers...into New Villages protected by armed guards and barbed wire.\\"  I doubt that Heinrich Himmler himself could have described a concentration camp more eloquently.  That's one of the oddest things about Crozier.  He calmly notes many of the criminal acts performed by the Western powers and their Third World puppets in the name of anti-Communism, but does so with an unspoken nod of approval, as though only a Soviet agent would find such brutal methods objectionable.  Crozier's chilling indifference to Western brutality leaves the unsettling impression that in the \\"war\\" against Communism, no act of murder or repression can be ruled out.<br />This book is psuedo-history, useful only for giving the reader a glance at the surreal worldview of an anti-Communist zealot.  What can one say about an author who claims that a freedom fighter like Nelson Mandela was essentially just a front man for a Soviet-backed terrorist movement (pg 505)? Likewise, what can one say about those who would cheer the author of such nonsense? If, for whatever reason, you decide to read this book, do so only with the greatest skepticism.

US	50130536	R3PO1X2MD9W7CF	0201331403	850807329	Software Test Automation	Books	4	88	89	N	N	A useful book, not only for automated testing	Book review<br />Mark Fewster and Dorothy Graham Software Test Automation Addison Wesley, 1999 ISBN 0-201-33140-3<br />A book for beginners in test automation. Everything you always wanted to know about test automation, but  never dared to ask, and the tool suppliers probably wonÕt tell you.<br />This  book is a must for every serious test manager. It is not only about  automation. It is really about test architecture and test suite design.  Most other books are about how to design test cases, or how to manage  testing. This book is about designing the whole stuff into such a form that  you can maintain it, that it will survice maintenance, and that you can  automate it. The background is test automation. Many examples show the  testware design pitfalls in building automated tests. But it hit me how  useful the book is to any testing effort, even manual testing.<br />The book  has two parts. Part 1 is a detailed guide to designing automated (or not  totally automated) tests. Questions of selecting and introducing test tools  are also discussed. Part 2 contains 15 guest chapters, written by people  who have experience in test automation, sharing their experience. These  chapters vary in style and are rather short.<br />There is a readers guide, It  shows what te read if you have different intentions and know more or less  from before.<br />Overview of part 1, the Test Automation Design  Part.<br />Chapter 1 gives the context of test automation. It places the  different tools into a test model and warns us of naive belief in and  application of automation.<br />Chapter 2 shows the results of capture and  playback. At the end of this chapter, the reader will have understood the  limited scope of application of this. Problems with script robustness and  automatic results comparison are shown.<br />From chapter 3, the focus changes  to scripting. The chapter presents the five levels of generating test  scripts, from linear through structures, shared, data-driven to keyword  based. The reader will soon see that investment in scripting can pay off.  The benefits of data driven or keyword driven testing are clearly shown.  The only negative comment is that keyword driven testing, the most advanced  and modern approach, is not shown to the same detail as the other  techniques. However, these techniques are presented by authors of  methodologies and real users in chapters 22 to 25.<br />Chapter 4 shows the  practical details of automated verification of test results. There are lots  of methods and pitfalls. The main possibilities are dynamic verification  (during running the tests) and static verification (afterwards. The other  option is how much to verify. In principle, everything may be interesting.  But this costs both work time, maintenance effort, storage, and makes tests  less robust and more proine to maintenance. An interesting alternative is  to design a broad smoke test where as much as possible is captures and  verified, and then a large main test, where every test only vewwrifies its  main objective. The authors also show different methods for comparing  ÒexoticÓ output. One objection is the shallow section on testing embedded  systems. At least for telecom systems, but also other ÒstandardÓ technical  interfaces, lots of commercial tools exist that can be used to verify  output in a problem oriented and intelligent way. There should also be some  more mention about verifying time correctness of system outputs. There  might also be some more focus on the use of check sums, statistical  selection out of large amounts of data etc.<br />Chapter 5 shows a possible  architecture of the test set. This chapter applies just as well to manual  as to automated testing. It fills a hole in IEEE Standard 829, namely  proposition as to how to structure the detailed test material, the scripts,  input data, utilities, expected results, and actual results, togehter with  all other information. The main idea behind the proposed directory  structure and naming conventions is to make it easy to maintain and find  through. It should also be easry to copy any needed test sets to a platform  where they are needed.<br />There could be more different approaches,  naturally, but the presented approach would work well and scale up. There  could also be a cross reference to what IEEE 829 contains, and some example  about how to use internet technology to document test structure, but all  this is of minor disadvantage. This chapter is valuable to anyone who needs  to structure test material.<br />Chapter 5 and 6 are a bit special, as they  are as useful for automated, as for nonautomated testing. They concern the  structure of the testing material, all the invoilved files, and the  preprocessing and postprocessing.  These chapters fill a hole in IEEE  Standard 829, where no consideration is given to the practical details of  building up and maintaining test material. A tool independent structure is  given, and advice about how to connect the material with tools. Chapter 6  is an eye opener to the naive user of test automation tools: Preprocessing  and postprocessing tasks must be automated, but are not in the scope of the  commercial tools.<br />Chapter 7 presents other issues about test suite  maintenance and maintainability. This is somehow good old material and  knowledge. It one uses the good old rules for structured design and  programing, and scheduled cleaning up of programs, the same could be  applied to test amintenance and test material standards. Chapter 7 serves  as a useful reminder about what you think you already knew, but maybe  forgot in the concrete case.<br />Chapter 8 gives ideas about how to measure  both testing and automated testing. For a metrics fan, this chapter is too  short. It only outlines lots of examples of what can be done and why, but  does not go into detail. On the other hand, there is enough literature  elsewhere about this. Many of the proposed measurements are not veryprecise, but good advice to Çthe poor manÈ who has not measured much and  has to fight for any resources to measure anything. The idea is: Anything  which is of interest can be made measurable in some way, maybe not the  ideal way and maybe not precisely. But any measurement is better than none.  The chapter does a useful job in that respect.<br />Chapter 9 is a collection  of points that have no natural place elsewhere. It includes short  discussions on what to automate and what not, how to select tests, the  order of running them, tricks to minimize time for failure analysis,  deciding the status of a test. Most of the points are well known and not  discussed in much detail. A good section is about test status, where the  authors present some good ideas about how to handle known bugs in the  products that are not going to be fixed for a while (and failed tests for  such bugs).<br />Chapter 10 and 11 concern selecting and introducing a test  tool. Much of these chapters are general and could be read by anyone having  to select and implement any software tool. What I am missing here is more  specific information about concrete test automation tool features to ask  for. The general questions to tool vendors are useful, but more concrete  advice special for test automation tools is lacking. A few concrete  references to test tool functionality overviews would have been helpful  here.<br />In all, I found part 1 very useful, and well worth the time spent  reading.<br />Part 2 is different. There are case studies about successful  introduction of test automation, the problems solved, the benfits achieved,  and the difficulties met. Chapter 12 to 18, as well as 20, 21, 23 and 25 to  28 are about successful cases. Most of these are short and regrettably  general in nature. Not easy to read concrete advice for your own situation.  The most interesting one was chapter 28, describing seveal unexpected uses  of automated tests at Microsoft. Chapter 19 is a study about testautomation failures, and this is useful. Probably it is always more easy to  learn from failures. Chapters 20 and 22 are very special, they both  describe keyword driven test automation design methods. Chapter 20 is about  the action word method, now called TestFrame, by Hans Buwalda from CMG,  whereas chapter 22 is about RadSTAR. Both chapters are useful, as they  describe the most modern approach to maintainable test design. However,  chapter 22 could be more detailed.<br />In all, I found less use for part 2 of  the book, probably because I have heard some of the stories before, at  conferences. It may be different to a person new to the field. I was  missing more case studies about atuomated tests of other than business  systems. There is a lot of automation to be done in this field, and very  often there is no alternaitve to automated testing.<br />In all: Buy the book.  In the worst case, chapters 5 and 6 only create benetitfs enough to make it  worth the money.<br />Hans Schaefer	2000-03-03

It gave us tons of verified ancient mysteries in virtually every fields of science relating to the history of the earth and its unexplained  vanished civilizations.  HAB Theory was a postulate which explained the  majority of them.  In a nutshell, the HAB Theory presented the fact that  because of the eccentricity of the North and South Poles to the magnetic  poles, it created an imbalance in the rotation of the earth.  When this  imbalance reached a stage where it overcame the gyroscopic effect of the  earth's rotation, the earth would see a near 90 degree shift of its axis of  rotation.  The result of which would mean that the poles ended up in the  equator and the result would be catastrophic to any life form.  This  phenomenon occured once every 3000 to 7000 years in the past.  The last  roll over occurred more than 7000 years ago.  Unlike most other novels, one  would find it very difficult to read HAB Theory just once or twice.  I  discovered some new evidence every time I re-read the book. Every time  after re-reading the book, my question used to be: Why didn't it happen?   Now, it is: When will it happen?  It is that good!	2000-02-28

It's hard to determine just where the facts stopped and the sensationalized gossip starts, but for the most part alot of the information can be verified by research. Plain  dull facts do not sell books so Anger cannot be blamed for adding some  spice to these stories. This is actually a good study of human nature and  how a privileged few behave when they hit the big time, then react when the  inevidible fadeaway comes. Many parallels can be found in sports and the  music industry where sudden fame and wealth changes people. People will  always be fascinated with the lifestyles of their heroes and idols. Anger  does a good job of dishing up the aspects these idols don't want their  adoring public to know.	2000-02-24

It gave me a lot of material to think about and mainly to achieve. I am sure Don Juan and Genaro were  deadly right when saying it tooks all of one`s life to become a true  warrior and seer but it pays off. Here we are confronted with abstract  explanations in a very concise and complete way but they can be verified  only if the person has followed the premises and achieved real results -  the most difficult thing of all. Everyone can think, judge, blame, gush,  etc. But all that matters is action. The one who makes it will see it  truely - otherwise it will be just another interpretation to consolidate  our self-assurance but it will lead us nowhere. So act, don`t think! -  understanding will come years later and thinking won`t have anything to do  with it.	2000-02-21

Despite the fact that he seems very knowledgable about Indo-European linguistics in general, Mr. Stirling makes grave errors whenever he tries to use Latin or make references to Archaeology; &quot;Troy VVI&quot; for  example--this isn't even a number, though I knew what he *wanted* was Troy  VII. Simple mistake, seemingly, but one that an Editor should have  verified.  Same with his Latin quotes; these should be researched.  <br />This  would lead me to my second criticism--who edits this book? Whomever it was  needs to find a new line of work, as I found error upon error, both in  homonyms and in spelling (especially of foreign words--'hectacomb' is not a  word; 'hecatomb' is).  This may seem a minor point, but seeing them time  and again really jars one from the book's setting.<br />That said, this is  about as filled with action as one could want; half a naval novel, half  military, and the other half an up-close look at the Bronze-Age Near East  (I do indeed realize that that's 3/2) as it comes in contact with the 20th  century technology and techniques of the Nantucketers.  <br />Pick it up, read  it, enjoy--and by all means investigate the *real* history in conjunction  with this!	2000-02-16

This simply could not, and should not be adapted because this book's characters drool blood , and the violence here could not be aptly and fairly depicted on  screen. If readers are not satisfied with the imagery ,and therefore crave  to actually see this brutality on a screen before them, then McCarthy's  vision of man as beast indeed can be verified. Blood Meridian is a partly  historical account of the 19th-century westward movement and destruction of  America's native people in America and Mexico by the bloodthirsty and  goldthirsty and nihilistic Glanton Gang.  The depiction of killing has  scarcely been so graphic, and yet so alluring: you find yourself reading  the horrifying scenes over and over again for their sublime description and  almost dreamlike imagery.  You have never seen nor imagined true Comanche  Indian garb, and here it is.  You have never read of a more evil character,  and here you may, in Judge Holden.  You have never read a novel whose main  protagonist you almost forget exists, because of the book's other enticing  components.  And you have never imagined a sky this blood red, but  remember: it was. Blood Meridian is McCarthy's masterpiece, and truly sets  him apart as the late 20th Century's master of apocalyptic prose.	2000-02-14

For example, onLincoln's atheism, there exists evidence from independent witnesses that Abe was secretly 'dunked' i.e. baptised into the German Baptist Church, the faith of his mother. Also, the Ann Ruttledge story (the love of Lincoln's youth) has been too well verified to be doubted, despite the cloying sentimentality attached to the story, rightly castigated by the author. On the Civil War, there are egregious errors - General George Pickett was never Lee's 'second-in-command' and Appromattox Manor House, which never existed, stands in for the McClean House at the village of Appomattox Court House, which seems to be confused with Grant's HQ at City Point. Yet, the book has merits. For admirers of Lincoln (and this is one) there is the winning over of a doubter, as the author once was. There are fresh insights and the book makes the reader almost an eavesdropper was the author stolls with Old Abe through his career. Despite the persistence of the hard-nosed politician in the war-time President, Jan Morris is correct in showing how Lincoln somehow transcended his time of trial as an artist might overcome his vicissitudes and produce a great artistic work. For the Lincoln detractors (and they are many!) there is the challenge of unravelling Morris' change of heart in succumbing to the spell of Lincoln, without subscribing to Lincoln mythology. Do not read this book as a biography of Lincoln, rather it is an essay on one person's encounters with the man. Use it as an introduction to the pursuit of the greatest and most elusive of American Presidents.  END	2000-02-08

True,  LogicVision developed much of the technology detailed in its eight  chapters. True, LogicVision owns and markets much of the technology. But  LogicVision almost single handedly paved the path to commercialized  embedded test and, except for Fluence Technology, Mentor Graphics and a few  others specializing mainly in memory BIST, is almost alone on that road,  even today.  Unlike other texts on designing for testability, this is not a  theoretical tome. It is a practical guide, aimed at designers, product  managers and test engineers. The technology described has been proven in  silicon, not merely in the lab but by the likes of Cabletron, Cisco  Systems, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Hughes, Lockheed-Martin, LSI Logic, National  Semiconductor, Nortel Networks, Stratus and Sun Microsystems. Truly a  sterling lineup of believers. Many of these companies have learned that  test no longer is a back-end problem, and that yield, quality, reliability,  cost and time to market depend on test. Many also have learned that  external test alone cannot do the job. Two of the reasons for that are the  rise of systems on silicon and the need to test chips at their intended  operating frequencies. With the former, diminishing access to internal  nodes or functional blocks fundamentally points to an embedded test  solution; with the latter, the spreading gap between on-chip operating  frequencies and maximum external tester frequency and accuracy point to the  same solution. The book, edited by Benoit Nadeau-Dostie, LogicVision's  chief scientist, illuminates at-speed testing as a way to perform tests,  diagnose failures, and make measurements using system clocks. Testing chips  at or close to normal operation directly affects the number of chips found  to be defective during system operation, yet pass all manufacturing and  functional tests. Through contributions from nine experts, working for or  associated with LogicVision, Design for At-Speed Test dispels one of the  stubborn myths about embedded test-the inability to move beyond the simple  pass/fail test. Of course, diagnosing failures is essential, and the book  not only describes several levels of diagnostic features but how to  accurately measure circuit parameters in data converters and phase-locked  loops. Other issues are answered, or at least addressed, in the quest for  practical implementation of embedded test. What restrictions are placed on  chip or system design styles? How is performance affected? What about skew  and timing issues? How are tests verified and debugged? Starting with a  technology overview, the book launches into memory test and diagnosis,  flows into logic test and diagnosis, describes the three phases involved in  inserting embedded test, shimmies over to the growing question of how to  handle embedded cores within a hierarchy (including legacy cores),  segways  to measuring on-chip parameters of converters and PLLs, and finally reaches  the top: system test and diagnosis and system reuse of embedded test. Still  learning about on-chip test? Start at the back, where a ten-page glossary  defines the terms, from A to Z.	2000-02-04

The story of his  scientific discoveries and his near fatal conflict with the reactionaries  of the inquisition, is both gripping and tragic. But, Dava Sobel adds to it  the poignant story of Galileo's relationship with his eldest daughter, Suor  Maria Celeste, a nun of the Poor Clare order in a convent outside Florence.  Her voice, which comes to us through her letters, is that of a daughter who  loved her father deeply, fully understood what he was trying to do and  always supported him in his struggles.<br />From her letters, and other  documents used by Sobel, (Galileo's own letters were apparently destroyed),  we also get a clear picture of the conditions of life in seventeenth  century Europe, and of the developing network of intellectuals who  contributed to the enlightenment. In addition to the conflict with the  church which dominated Galileo's life, he had to cope with several periods  during which the plague ravaged the communities in which he lived, and  eventually the death from dysentry of his beloved daughter at the age of  thirty four. <br />The reader is not only informed but deeply moved by this  most humane book	2000-01-26

Unfortunately this book propagates the same  misinformation as many other bad science books such as &quot;The Tao of Physics.&quot;  These books make a big deal about the nonlocality of quantum physics and about quantum  entanglement and the experiments that have proved quantum entanglement. All  of this is true. Unfortunately they mislead through omission.  Nonlocality  and quantum entanglement are very delicate and very rare events.  A  physicist doing an experiment has to work very hard to keep a quantum  entangled system separate from the rest of the universe. Once the system  interacts with the rest of the universe, the quantum entanglement vanishes.  This is a well-known fact that all first year physics grad students learn.  (I should know, I'm a physics professor.)  So the whole conceit of the book  is wrong.  While quantum nonlocality does occur, it is actually very rare  and disappears quickly--this is experimentally verified as well--and so the  notion of a totally connected universe is a lie and a cheat.	2000-01-19

This book moved me to read all of his other books, per his advice at the end of this one.  <br />I found his tour through the various knowledge movements beginning with Romantic times and  on through postmodernism to be entertaining and enlightening.  His style is  very clear and understandable, and he writes for layman and academics  alike.<br />He seems to have intended this book for a wider audience than his  other books, and as such, leaves plenty of areas rather vague by just  touching on them lightly.  Having read his other works, people who are  interested in the ideas put forth in Marriage of Sense and Soul should  definetly use this book as a springboard to his other books.<br />And that I  think is this book's strength: a very good introduction to the complex  world of integral studies.  Whether &quot;correct&quot; all the time or  not, he represents the cutting edge of the movements, perhaps from the  sheer number of philosophers, mysticists, psychologists, theorists and  academics that he has read and attempted to integrate; it is clear from  reading only a few pages that Wilber is well read!<br />The assumption that  Wilber seems to be operating under is that spiritual experience is indeed  &quot;something&quot;.  Something that can be verified, explained,  replicable, and studied.  It may not be able to be observed in the  laboratory, or  in a test tube, but using a broad definition of the  &quot;scientific method&quot; that he offers, spirituality is given a new,  modern light that can be understood by anyone, and most of al,  *experienced* by anyone.  If this assumption is not shared by the reader,  then this book might not be very interesting or worth the effort.<br />All in  all, Marriage of Sense and soul is a very good read on a complex  topic  with a set of ideas that are ultimately very egalitarian.	2000-01-12

After reading this book, I was moved to read all that I can by Ken Wilber, starting (per his advice) with _Brief History of Everything_ and _The Eye of Spirit_ and almost everything after  all.  Its his style that I like best--that is, he writes for the layman,  first time reader, and academic alike.<br />This books addresses the thread  that can connect sprituality with science.  That is all it is--not by  reducing each, but by showing how they connect.  It's really quite  elementary in approach and it makes more and more sense with time.<br />The  thread is that if something, some form of knowledge (beit scientific or  spiritual) can be known, anyone can know it.  It can be known each time  someone (scientist or a spiritual seeker) sets out to find it.  Do  something, get results, compare with results of others doing the same  thing.  How much more scientific could an apporach be?  Or even, how much  more egalitarian could one hope for?<br />The assumption for this, and all of  Wilber's books, is that spiritual experience is indeed  &quot;something.&quot;  It might not be able to be seen in the laboratory,  or in a test tube, but it is &quot;something&quot; and as such, can be  studied, verified, debated, agreed upon--but more than that, can be  *experienced*.  If the reader does not share the same assumption, then she  might not find much in this book worth much.<br />That thread is the crux of  the book, and the rest is an interesting account of how historical  movements (romantic on through post-modernism) have viewed knowledge.  And  in doing so, he provides the layman with a clear and general account of the  movements, enough to give readers a working understanding and the ability  to jabber and babble about &quot;intellectual things&quot; at  parties.<br />This book does not address in great detail much of his work in  transpersonal psychology, which perhaps is his strongest suit, and for that  I'd recommend his newly published &quot;Collected Works, Volume Four&quot;.blished &quot;Collected Works, Volume Four&quot;.	2000-01-11

If, instead, you read this book in finding out \\"how you  too can be a millionaire\\" than you'll be (or should be)  disappointed.<br />Cause and effect are debased in this book. By living  frugal, having devoted relationships to children, having certain beliefs,  etc. the authors would like to imply that being a millionaire is well  within your reach. This ascertain can be verified if by studying all people  we determine that only frugal people become millionaires and millionaires  are the only frugal people on earth. If millionaires are the only people  who have devoted relationships to children and the rest of  \\"us\\" do not,  than the authors can start claiming cause and effect.  If the rest of \\"us\\";  however, are also frugal (or at least a good portion of us) and we have not  become millionaires, than cause and effect can be thrown out the window.  One part of this book that is distressing is how it conveys the message  that those who are wealthy have the \\"merit\\" to be wealthy, and those who  are not have character flaws. This ignores realities of structural  barriers, sociological influences etc. Yep, this book best belongs in pop  psychology books or People Magazine.

That he got the previous personality's wife's name incorrect, tends  to support the researcher's credibility and thus, to my mind, strengthens  the case. It is not unusual, in cases of verifying past-life regression, to  get details like names wrong (see &quot;Mission to Millboro&quot; by Marge  Rieder, for example)--nor for the basic facts to be accurate. So Capt.  Snow's results are consistent with other verified cases in this regard.

Incandescent? Important, maybe, critical perhaps; but &quot;incandescent&quot;? Even if it were, how does that relate to this  'coming global superstorm'?<br />This very tabloid style, minimal facts,  lacking clear causal linkage, is really what this book is about. It shows  the characteristic absence of real substance of Mr. Streiber's other books.  Some of the evidence the authors refer to is discussed in much greater  detail in the infinitely better 'Cataclysm' by D.S. Allan and J.B.Delair,  which does show the linkage between geological effect and ancient  myth.<br />But for any kind of proof you need to establish that fact A is  reliable, then fact B, that they are related to each other, and then you  can infer something else - which is still hypothetical until verified. The  authors don't even establish basic facts, and their hypothesis doesn't make  any real or verifiable predictions.<br />Global warming may be a secondary  effect, but that doesn't stop Bell or Streiber. Mr. Bell's regular  contributor, Linda Moulton Howe, stated on one of his shows that the plant  life of North America is soaking up all the greenhouse gas emissions of  human activity in North America, but that doesn't deter our authors.  <br />It's a fun theory, all the better for lacking any kind of timeline:  Nostradamus went and put a date down, a mistake Bell and Streiber are not  going to repeat.<br />So stock up on the dried foods, short-wave radios and  gold that Mr. Bell promotes on his show.

But coming to the Keirsey as a skeptic, I've found it unexpectedly accurate, on each of two very different occasions.  When I tried the original version of the Keirsey several years ago, its insights had been interesting and useful; but when it occurred to me recently to take the test again, this  time with _Please Understand Me II_, I was really struck by the ways in which the results differed, and how certain differences in my personality had been pinpointed, again, with much accuracy.  So, even as I'd never trust an assessment of this format to divine anything like a true self, the test did give me occasion for recognizing some of the fundamental changes I had undergone over the years.  (For those who might be trying to pick between the two, this second edition I think is more thorough than the first.)  On this purely practical basis I would recommend the book, as a possible aid toward fuller self-understanding.

It is a hodge podge of  thoughts, green speak, observations, the authors past 20 years of  life, some interesting applications of solar structures, much green  speak, her experience with a greenhouse and the business it generated,  more green speak, ...full-color pictures of plants, animals, insects,  artwork, green speak, and lastly green speak.  Whether written this way  on purpose or not it is confusing.  It is a very disjointed book; more  about a persons philosophy of life than about a greenhouse that was  heated and cooled by strictly solar methods.  The books layout and  progression is far from logical and it is quite a chore wadding  through all of the philosophizing to arrive at some meat.  Does this  book have value?  Some.  But cut out all of the psycho babble, green  speak and moralizing, rearrange the contents, do some more homework on  solar and other peoples projects and failures, get a few scientific  facts verified, more data and details on what Mss Edey did and did not  do, then perhaps it might be a worthwhile book.  One glaring lack, at  least as far as I am concerned; it is not a How To book.  Maybe that  is not a big issue when one is writing in a diary, but when the books  title page uses those words and the book does not deliver, then it is a  major issue.  The income generating potential of a solar heated  greenhouse that uses strict organic methods has a lot of merit and  expanded outdoors during the summer months one could expect that the  income would increase.  She makes a claim that $500,000 is possible  with the 10,000 sq. ft. greenhouse and about an acre of land.  She  never made that much on her operation and extrapolates from her own  experiences that it is possible.  I would take that with a cup of  salt.  She very well may be right but she has no proof.  She didn't do  it and did not mention anyone else that had.  So again the title of  the book is misleading. Some interesting things gleaned from the book:  1.  It is possible to heat a greenhouse completely with solar  means. 2.  It is possible to cool a greenhouse completely with solar  means. 3.  A living could be made from the above greenhouse. 4.  Animals incorporated into the greenhouse environment can enhance the  quality of the plants by emitting co2 and they can provide another  source of income.    There may be some other things but as I said you  will have to dig for them....	1999-12-08

Tolkien's Middle Earth is rich and perfectly self-contained.  He never violates the  parameters he establishes for this fantasy world, which he fills with  memorable characters and intriquing plot turns.  What great escapist  literature!  I only hope you students who've expressed disdain for this  book will later reconsider, and give it another reading.  I suspect the  circumstances (required reading, homework assignments) may have had more to  do with your negative regard for the book than any shortcoming in the  storytelling.  Consider the (almost) universal positive regard for  Tolkien's work.  Sometimes the hype is warranted.	1999-12-05

To begin, I've read numerous works that would be considered in the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; genre by people unwilling to deal researched, proven (to the extent that something can be proven) facts. There are wonderful, insightful well researched books out there. There are books that document the creation of the HIV virus (aids and the doctors of death) and numerous assasinations (orders to kill). I'm sure most negative reviews of this book are penned by people that you see as &quot;unable to see the truth&quot;, I am in a quest for the truth, and this book falls severly short. First, a whole section of &quot;evidence&quot; comes from a top secret government document supposedly found on a computer at a garage sale. Many people have done real research and proven goverment conspiracies with verified government documents. If your like me and want to see both sides of the argument, there are plenty of books that (while having the exact same assertions as BAPH) actually document it	1999-12-03

This literal &quot;son  of Captain Marvel&quot; (Marvel H. Parsons) was himself given the name  Marvel at birth.  Later his mother began calling him John, and he came to  be known as Jack by his friends.  In general Carter's book seems pretty  well-researched.  I appreciate the fact that _Sex and Rockets_ focuses more  on the subject of Jack and his life than earlier literary efforts which  have exploited the mythos surrounding Jack and his infamous Babalon Working  to propagate highly speculative, only vaguely and loosely associated fringe  agendas on the part of various writers.  Carter has done a good job  sticking to the subject.<br />The research in _Sex and Rockets_ focuses  primarily on Jack's scientific career and secondarily on the Babalon  Working itself.  Of the former, the author traces a clear path detailing,  validating and celebrating Parsons' contributions to the field of rocket  fuel technology.  Carter succeeds in his mission to carefully excavate and  restore the previously almost-buried name and contributions of this  scientist to their rightful stature in history.  Of the latter, the author  draws a clear juxtaposition between Cameron's view of the Babalon Working  and Jack's own understanding.  Carter clearly pinpoints the persistent  indications in Jack's own records that reveal Jack's personal expectations  of something more along the lines of an apotheosis than an actual  incarnation, despite repeated communications from the Babalon archetype,  also faithfully recorded, to redirect Jack's focus to the true nature of  the Working, as time and again She gently deflects Jack's attention away  from concerning himself with the future vehicle of Her manifestation.   Carter also engages in some excellent reconstructive work about portions of  the Working on which Jack's record is scant.  While I do not agree with all  Carter's conclusions or his particular slant on the Working at times, the  Babalon Working remains a subject of myriad interpretations.  Carter  succeeds in his attempt to provide a more objective portrayal of the  Working, and as such, his rings closer to true than other more fanciful and  &quot;fringe&quot; speculations upon it have done in the past.<br />One thing  I did not like about this book was the conspicuous absence of source  citation.  There were many interesting pieces of biographical information  for which the author consistently failed to provide citation, neglecting to  indicate whether he obtained the information from documents, records,  conversations or interviews with people connected to Jack, etc.  Comments  by Cameron and others are recorded without so much as supplying the context  in which they were made, when they were made, or to whom.  Information  about Jack's life which was not previously documented or heretofore known  to the public is written as fact without offering any outside verification  thereof.  For example, Carter writes about a brief period of time where  Jack's scientific career had stalled and Jack had taken an interim job at a  filling station.  Yet there is no source cited for this information.   Whether the author obtained it from employment records, interviews with  others connected with Jack's estate, or elsewhere remains a mystery, and  the reader is left having to take the author's word with no means to verify  it for himself.  True, not every bit of information needs to be footnoted,  and there is a lot of previously documented information about Jack's  career.  Nevertheless, previously undocumented and/or unpublished  information should always be cited to verify its authenticity.  Instead,  the majority of existing citations in this book consist of things  previously well-documented and cited elsewhere on numerous occasions, such  as references to Crowley's writings and letters or O.T.O. ritual.<br />As a  researcher, I find this frustrating, because without due citation for  biographical information that is not documented elsewhere, how can _Sex and  Rockets_ be regarded or used bibliographically as an authoritative source?   The intelligent reader needs to see things historically documented or at  least reasonably verified via citation, particularly where statements are  attributed to other parties.  This lack of documentation is definitely this  book's biggest weakness.  The author clearly did extensive and worthwhile  research, so the lack of source citation is both puzzling and devaluing to  the book as a whole.<br />Fair warning:  there's one paragraph in the chapter  &quot;Death and Beyond&quot; which brings up a very nasty bit of recent  hearsay without duly informing the reader that the item in question is, in  fact, unsubstantiated hearsay and that no physical evidence has been  produced to substantiate it.  Unless either the sources of the rumor, the  author himself, or the publishers can produce the physical evidence  claimed, or at least a sufficiently clear disclaimer as to its hearsay  nature, repetition of this claim is inexcusably irresponsible, especially  considering this book is the first reasonably thorough biographical work  about Jack to be published.  It smacks of crass sensationalism, which is  totally unnecessary in exploring the life of a colorful and diversely  talented person like Jack.  I say produce the physical evidence or retract  the rumor -- or at least amend the paragraph to clearly point out that it  is nothing but hearsay and that no physical evidence to support the claim  has been produced.  Anything less is just plain exploitive, more worthy of  the &quot;Jerry Springer show&quot; than an otherwise fairly  well-researched biography.<br />Despite these two serious complaints, I still  recommend this book as a ground-breaking, definitive biographical work on  Jack Parsons.

In clear terms it explains the key components of a successful Web venture  (commercial or otherwise) through the identification of browsers  aggregating towards communities.  That growth on the Net is not subject to  marketing gurus or advertising execs but rather through an organic  evolution.  Sounds a bit esoteric? Not at all, the real benefit of this  book is that it breaks down each statement and supposition into clear,  defined terms that can be verified through real-life examples, examples  which the reader can investigate on the Net for themselves (hey, you learn  by doing!). There is a very useful section on the lifecycle of a Web  community and how to create one.  It stresses quick entry onto the Web and  gives clear advice on what the entrant should aim for at each stage of the  creation of their 'community'. Best of all, through what the authours call  'Fractal Breadth' it lays out how a 'community' can expand and branch out.   The Final sections of the book are especially useful in that they outline  how a traditional company's infrastructure should change to accommadate a  Web presence.  Clear, conscise, non-insulting to the intellect and focused.   Great value for money.	1999-12-01

Yes!  After curing your cancer with this recipe  it cannot come back.&quot;  <br />I believe that book also stated it did not  matter at what stage one's cancer was, she had the cure. So now we have  still another book with &quot;The Cure For All Advanced Cancers&quot;.<br />I  was impressed at the beginning of this new book with Hulda Clark's style.   She comes across as very caring, creative and knowledgeable.  I'm not a  medical expert, so a lot of what she writes seems impressive to me.  Some  of it has me wondering if maybe this person has something and the public  needs to listen.  But yet another part of me knows we have been down this  road many times before.  Intelligent minds that are talented with words and  charismatic -- and yet we find out later how wrong they are.<br />Hulda Clark  claims to have &quot;the cure for all advanced cancers&quot;, an extremely  bold claim.  Such a huge claim should at least be backed up with good  evidence, but I cannot find it.  The technical jargon is formidable, so I  studied the 50 or so cases she presents at the back of the book.<br />These  cases use fictitious names.  Maybe that is fair, to protect the people from  being bothered.  But it also makes it hard to check with these people on  the details that are in the book.  And in this book with &quot;the cure for  all advanced cancers&quot;, we find out sadly that many of these people are  definitely not cured.  Hulda Clark appears to have no system in place for  following up on these people, or compiling meaningful data on the alleged  effectiveness of her methods.  As many of these patients leave her care she  hopes they do well, but worries they may not.  Maybe they are not willing  or able to have their teeth worked on, change certain detailsof their  lifestyle, or move to an environment that is free of some particular  substance.  Clark usually has some excuse when patients fail.  We need more  than a bunch of cases where it is unclear if even one single person was  saved at all by Hulda Clark.  <br />Conventional medicine keeps records, does  studies, and opens this information up for review so it can be verified and  analyzed.  Conventional medicine does not claim to cure all cancers, and in  fact admits it can help little in so many cases, and that it does make  mistakes.  Practitioners of conventional medicine, very intelligent people,  also die and lose loved ones to cancer.  Over the years it seems none of  them have followed Clark's methods and been cured.  As much as even  physicians dying of cancer would like a cure, they know that Hulda Clark  has not shown she has one.	1999-11-28

It's hardly a dime novel; it's a  list of her visits her family and her friends. The prose sounds like: Jane  went here. Jane wrote to her sister who was staying there. Jane disliked  one sister-in-law. Jane liked another sister in law. I think the reason a  sillouette of Jane is on the cover is that the reader is treated to a bio  of a shadow person. There is nothing in Jane's life above the daily  commonplace lot here; yet there must have been something within Jane or in  the way Jane saw her surroundings that was not  commonplace to her because  Jane's novels are not commonplace to us. As to any - ahem - kennel  comparisons: a Jane Austen novel is like a well prepared pitcher of  lemonade - enough sugar and water to soften the juice but not enough to  subdue it. Why shouldn't her family letters be the same? I don't think this  author dislikes Jane. I know many tart tongued women and enjoy their  conversation (when I'm not the subject of it). They're usually very wise  and dicerning. This book cried out for foot/end notes that tied the above  scraps of info to a source - either to a letter or a book in the Selected  Bibliography (why &quot;selected&quot;?) so they can be verified. It's not  good for study purposes.	1999-11-18

By comparison, Freud's writing about dreams is lucid and engaging.<br /><br />However, the most off-putting thing in the book is the author's uncritical acceptance of dreams as psychic phenomena. To hear a grownup person at the turn of the twenty-first century -- a scientist with a PhD, no less -- spouting nonsense about \\"telepathic dreaming\\" and using dreams to predict the future is disheartening, to say the least. (He even cites Shirley MacLaine's idiocies about reincarnation as if they are to be taken seriously.)<br /><br />Although there might be some interesting and useful information in this book, the author's cumbersome language and spiritual beliefs that taint his scientific objectivity put me off completely.<br /><br />June 2002<br /><br />Imagine my surprise at finding myself personally attacked in a review of this book by someone who signs in only as \\"A reader from USA.\\" Sounds like a ringer, folks.<br /><br />I challenge the statement, \\"As for telepathic and precognitive dreaming, they are facts, not fictions, well documented and well studied.\\" Psychic claims have been well studied, but according to the documentation, no scientific study has ever validated the existence of any psychic phenomenon.<br /><br />\\"We ... have much to learn about ourselves ... from our dreams.\\" About our inner selves, that is. Dreams are subjective. They are neither receptors of magical visions of the future nor evidence of past lives. As to what we can learn from Mr. Van de Castle, accepting his unverified claims can only teach us how gullible we are.<br /><br />Van de Castle is an indefatigable researcher, but he's no more an \\"authority\\" on dreams than Erich von Daniken is on ancient history. It's not the accumulation of facts but the scientific validity of the conclusions based on those facts that makes one an authority. Despite much current disenchantment with Freudian analysis, Freud's \\"On the Interpretation of Dreams\\" is still the best writing on the subject.<br /><br />Another reviewer says \\"Contrary to the last review, I did not find this book difficult to read or understand.\\" I didn't say the book was either. I said it was academic, awkward, and cumbersome. I don't necessarily find such writing hard to read, but it's not much fun.<br /><br />January 2003<br /><br />Mine is undoubtedly the \\"one negative review\\" cited by another critic, who wrongly infers that I am \\"a Freudian.\\" All that can be gleaned from the above is that I am a rationalist who admires good writing.<br /><br />Agree or disagree with Freud, his propositions have a rational basis. The analogy of believing the Earth to be the center of the universe applies more properly to Van de Castle's views on psychic phenomena and reincarnation than to Freud's attempts to understand dreams within the framework of modern science.<br /><br />Freud's pioneering efforts inspired others to seek greater understanding of human motivation and behavior. Van de Castle's mysticism puts us back in the Dark Ages.<br /><br />Amazon.com's listing of Freud's \\"Interpretation of Dreams\\" contains a number of thoughtful reviews and critiques.

This world is not subject to the experimental  model of verification, but it is verified by the regularity of its  manifestations. Does everyone have these experiences?  Unlike Gellert, do  they lack the confidence to share them? Do some people dismiss them out of  hand?  Do some people have them and others don't?  The more people I talk  to on this topic, the more unusual experiences I am finding out that they  have had.	1999-10-30

Having read this book, I feel that I have a better idea of what may have happened in the Roswell area in 1947.  I have read many books and articles  and heard many speakers about the crash, but now I got to read the  testimony of someone who has been there.  Why would he lie about it.  He  has verified much of what has been written already and has added  information that hasn't been known.  I found the book very interesting and  informative.  Every serious researcher of this phenomena should read this  book and then draw his or her own conclusions.	1999-10-29

Allen's &quot;First Steps in Genealogy&quot; was a godsend.  It contained a wealth of useful information written in an enjoyable manner.  This was just the push I needed to get me going seriously pursuing that family  history I'd been planning to research for years.  It wasn't a boring  textbook, but written in very easy-to-follow language.  I needed to start  at the beginning, but I didn't want to be talked down to, either.  This  book handled the task wonderfully.  I may have preferred a bit more  in-depth information about resources available on the internet, but Allen's  work didn't dwell on that methodology nor depend on the reader having  access to the internet.  All in all, it was well worth the money; it was  well-written, motivational, and informative.  I am pleased to say that I  have already researched my family history back three generations on one  side and five generations on the other since getting the book.  With its  help I found the information, verified my sources, and organized all the  information in a neat, orderly system.  It has been an interesting  adventure and I'm anxious to continue the search.	1999-10-23
US	52636012	R2VREFGOD3OFS	0316180661	358661477	Consciousness Explained	Books	2	21	43	N	N	Not exactly an investigation of consciousness . . .	This book, as has been often said, might better have been titled &quot;Consciousness Explained Away.&quot;  However, it does have its merits, particularly in the line of empirical evidence regarding  neurophysiological activity.  The main problem, though, is that this book  actually says _nothing_ of consciousness itself.  As with nearly every  other approach--whether philosophical, theological, psychological,  empirical-scientific, etc.--this book describes very well a whole mess of  phenomena arising _within_ consciousness (from synapses to thoughts to  human beings) but utterly fails to investigate the nature of awareness  itself.  It is an analysis of phenomena rather than noumenon, appearances  rather than the witness of appearances, and the author, like nearly every  other human being, fails to grasp this incredibly simple point.  <br />No  amount of study and discourse on the nature of neurological activity,  computational models, philosophies, thoughts, feelings, memories,  experiences, and psychological pathologies is going to give you the  slightest understanding of what is aware of all those things.   Consciousness--pure, ever-present, expansive awareness--is not a thing, not  an object, not an experience, not a phenomenon capable of being observed.   Rather, it is the infinite context in which all things, all phenomena, or  all experiences arise, stay a bit, and pass away.  Never does consciousness  itself come or go, and this can be directly verified by everyone.  (It is  the mind and body--aggregate thoughts, feelings, memories,  perceptions--that change, turn off and on, and come and go; never does  consciousness itself turn off and become &quot;unconscious.&quot;  If you  mistakenly identify yourself with the mind or body, however, rather than  with awareness itself, &quot;you&quot; will naturally seem to fade out  along with those things.)         <br />In truth, there is only one  consciousness, one awareness, and it is the same in all beings, in all  places and times.  It is the infinite clearing, the vast emptiness, the  unmoving space within which all people, places, and things come and go.   But the emptiness itself never comes or goes, or even changes or moves at  all.  It is beyond time, beyond change, beyond spatiotemporal phenomena  altogether, and it is what we truly are.  Aware of time, you are timeless.   Aware of space, you are spaceless.  Aware of forms, you are formless.  And  when you discover the truth of this, the immediately, undeniably verifiable  Fact of this, you will know what this world really is, and you will know  exactly what you are doing here.	1999-10-15

Let's limit the field to only those characters  known world-wide by just one name. Certainly  Hitler will be included within that group; more than some are,  like him,  at least mass murderers. So our century, more  sanguinary  than others seems to bestow  fame  upon  those who manage  to  climb  to the top of a mountain of corpses.   After the atrocity,   the  question  is always Why?  As if in finding the full, complete  and verified  explanation  would in some way soothe  our concerns  about  our world  and  ourselves. If we found the curriculum  and study guides  and the  library   and plans  for the Holocaust  Management  Business School ;  would we be  better  or worse off for knowing?  Mr. Rosenbaum  in looking  for Hitler  interviews  25 \\"explainers\\" a  collection of  historians, psychohistorians,   pundits, philosophers, all manner  of academia  with grant  money  to  spend and time to blow  a few years in Europe.  What  he finds are cliques,  and groups  in trench  warfare against  each  other, sniping  in the  professional journals, tossing press-release  grenades ; squadrons  of  publisits  carpet  faxing the media. <br />One explainer  is combing  all the  existent  photographs   of  early  20th century Vienna looking for just   one protean  image: Freud, Mahler  and Hilter walking  arm in arm on the  Ringstrasse.  If we had that  photo would  the  6 Million  rest  easier?    Would  it stop or start another  50 years of Hilter books?<br />One  dillusional explainer, a former literature student, parses  every Hitler  speach looking for \\"code-words\\" by  which Hitler communicated secret    messages to his followers.  Not finding them  doesn't  mean that Hitler  only meant  what he said; on the contrary , the very absence  of  \\"code-words\\" is  evidence  that  the secret  communications  were  made.   Go figure.  It is the lack of specific  commands  and orders that drive  this explainer and others to read between lines and words; finding just  what  they want. Has the same Rorschach  technique  been applied to  others  on our list, Gandhi, Einstein, Stalin, Mao, Freud, Churchill?  Does  it   tell us more about  the subject  or the \\"explainer\\"?  More  about  ourselves?<br />We meet the goofballs you already know , Goldhagen and his  friend Irving; but the real surprise,  the crank that makes  both  look  like a thoughtful, meticulous, professional historians,  is the unfortunate   Herr Lanzmann.  He has all the answers because  only he is allowed to ask  the questions; all other explainers  are revisionists, justifiers and  deniers...Nazis.  He is the true \\"paper  Eichmann\\" whose  work is to  destroy  all other  analysis, comment  and opinion;  a  Fascist  with a  small  `f'  that  only  Adolf could  hug. Has the community of explainers   accepted into their  fold a Hitlerian  character; hysterical  in his  eliminationist  and  exclusionary  rhetoric?  Are they  afraid of him?   Will they continue to allow  his rant?      <br />It seems to me that  Rosenbaum in bashing around on the world tour of Hitler Studies has  produced two things; the first is the best biography of Hitler yet , not  the tactical  military  dictator, but the person behind the image;   incomplete  but compressive.  The second  is a review of the convoluted and   politically  charged  community  of explainers; those with agendas and  those unbiased, but all engaged in an activity that insures , after a half  a century,   that Hitler lives.<br />Put this book up on your shelf next to  it's only comparable  volume: \\"The Hitler of History\\".	1999-10-12
US	51278775	R3N3EIMYEHXX9H	0806512385	252369859	Wicca Craft: The Modern Witches Book of Herbs, Magick and Dreams (Library of the Mystic Arts)	Books	3	30	37	N	N	Not the best, sadly.....	After reading the great book reviews of this book, I actually expected it to be better than it was.  I ought to shoot a hole with a gun through this book for not explaining ritual.  She gives examples of rituals, yet doesn't  perform how to explain them and in simple terms....her methods of ritual  are odd.  I never cast a circle with white paint or chalk.  It's not a bad  idea, but a beginner reading this book wont know the importance that  feeling and energy has when casting a circle.  Her introduction and 1st  chapter (History) is excellent.  Also, her information on the Sabbats are  also excellent, but one should stop and think, she started the Sacred Wheel  of Wisdom school.  But, her Sabbat rituals are not the best (they appear in  chapter four: Pagan Rituals).  Who wrote these rituals?  Gerina?  Although  in each of the rituals, they speak of the reason one is celebrating, they  are lame, can get wordy, and some have, in a sense, ridiculous props.  For  better rituals read The Wiccan Path: A guide for the Solitary Practitioner  by Rae Beth.  Chapter Three on Tools and Symbolism is not bad, but Gerina  needs to realize that nothing is set in stone, not even her words, and one  does not need a ceremonial robe or sword just to practice Wicca.  Did this  author not have money and convenience in mind?  Don't get upset over the  inverted pentagram either.  Remember, Gerina, like most Wiccans, are past  the point of seeing any evil within the pentagram and when it's seen, it  means to us what we have been taught, the correct thing.   So, if she wants  or uses the inverted (horned god) pentagram, that's fine with me.  She  could have explained magick a little better, but it's a nice introduction.   It's nice that she explains charms, amulets, and talismans....but....Gerina  is exploring dangerous territory when she starts speaking about magick word  squares.  She speaks of even making a spirit appear before you.  She should  not make unverified (yet, maybe not to her) promises, especially not to  absolute curious individuals and beginners.  Why does she mention  parchment?  As in all her other books, what century does this woman live  in?  Back to magick word squares, an experienced Wiccan knows how magick  works, but can one explain how a magick word square works?  Chapter Eight  entitled the Witch's kitchen is very interesting, and I was very pleased to  find a recipe for Handfasting cake and also a recipe for old fashioned  Witch's soap, as well as a flying and love potion, all very interesting as  well as a variety of types of incenses.  All very interesting.  Her chapter  on Wortcunning is so-so.  Her section on folk names is interesting and  useful, but when she starts on all those lists (which, in a sense, can be  helpful) and correspondences, the chapters begin to get long and drawn out.   Luckilly, she kept her chapter on Pagan deities to a minimum, she goes on  for hours in some of her other books.  Her lists of herbs, as I said, can  be helpful, but like in all her other books, methods and types of  administration or using herbs in general is not discussed.  Moving on, she  does some nice research on her chapter on tree magick, but a beginner may  wonder why this section is included.  She includes some folkloric spells  and divination reguarding and containing trees.  Her chapter on dreams is  not bad, and I disagree with the book reviewer who said for better dream  information go to RavenWolf, that's not necessarily true.  RavenWolf  doesn't explain different types of dreams, for the most part, only her  opinions.  Like always though, Gerina Dunwich takes us on a trip through  her ancient grimoire reguarding dreams.  Notice, it seems, all her dream  divinations are reguarding love.  She repeats things from book to book.   She gives two spells reguarding dreams.  One includes fasting with water  for a whole day for best results.  I really did like her chapter on dream  magick.  The final chapter (a book with no conclusion) is on Pagan  periodicals, a chapter that could be seriously outdated.... This is a good  book, don't get me wrong, and it can answer a lot of questions about Wicca,  but Gerina really did leave a lot out, and personally I am not afraid of  mischievous ghosts, elves, and fairies like this author seems to be with  her neoclassical New England style of writing.... In closing, this book,  although will get a beginner started, may be better for a nonpractitioner,  but I could be wrong.  It would answer a lot of questions and hopefully  dispel fears of the unknown.	1999-10-09

This is the ONLY book that I have seen reviewed on Amazon which BOTH the publisher AND the author comment on.  In fact, the author's  &quot;comment&quot; include EVERY chapter title, the effect of which is, to  include a long and free advertisement for his wares, additionally, the  prospective buyer has to hunt further down to find the reader reviews.  Note that Mr Turner &quot;highly recommends&quot; HIS OWN BOOK!  How  incredibly self-serving.  What is more, the publisher (probably just Mr.  Turner, in a different guise) includes &quot;reviews&quot;, many of which  appear to be merely repetitions of Amazon reviews, which are, themselves,  very suspect.  Many of these reviews follow an identical pattern, namely,  (a) a non-critical, laudatory comment from (b) a BLANK email address but  (c) do include &quot;the reviewer's name&quot; (which, of course, cannot be  verified).<br />I did buy and read the book and, although I'm an active trader  with ten years experience in managing my own investments, I found nothing  of any value between the covers.  Nada, zero, zip.  To charge $60+ on top  of this, is, the most breathtaking example of pure chuztpah I have seen in  the American marketplace.	1999-10-06

Just Jumper Settings.&quot;  It is a compendium of jumper settings from the manuals for motherboards, supplemented in a few cases with comments on known problems with the  boards.  The book's introduction describes it as well as anything:  <br />&quot;This is primarily a book containing motherboard jumper settings,  but other information, such as known bugs, and performance issues have been  included when available.  Not all comments have been verified, as they have  been obtained from various places, including service departments and  magazine reviews, but are believed to be reliable.  To save space, diagrams  have not been used, as a good engineer shouldn't need them if the  motherboard has been marked up properly (if used, they are for  identification purposes).  In other words, this is meant to be a quick  reference for those familiar with computers.  Parallel, serial, and floppy  connectors, etc. have also been excluded, except when they depart from the  standard, and where a setting indicates an on condition, the opposite has  been left out, as it should be obvious.  Jumpers or switches not mentioned  are usually factory set and should be left alone.&quot;<br />     The author,  Phil Croucher, is British and the book was copyright in 1998.  These two  facts imply that many of the motherboards described may not be available in  the United States, motherboards sold in the United States may not be  described, and, as the book probably took a year or so to write,  motherboards sold after about 1996 may not be mentioned.  Where I write  this there are five motherboards within reach; none are in the manual.         If you are a computer technician who sees an occasional older motherboard  with problems and no documentation, this could be an invaluable resource.   If you have a recently manufactured board and its documentation, look  elsewhere.  Especially if you have a computer that worked one day and not  the next; if you knowthe problem has to be something simple like a  resistor, capacitor, or inductor that has failed; and all you want is a  book that will tell you where to put the test leads of your DVM so you can  check out the components, you are urged in the strongest possible terms to  seek another book.  The book has no text and few insights into how  motherboards function.	1999-10-05

I read UFs original edition in 1963 and joined the Stelle Group in Chicago; wonderful people from all over the world. Worked on the site as the &quot;city&quot; came into being. It grew more and more  &quot;cult-like&quot; with Richard making personal decisions--I quit when  he suggested that my wife was not for me and that we should separate. Then  Richard was asked to leave for Clintonesque reasons; he did and went to  Texas while his second wife, Gail, mentioned in the orig book, took a  splinter group to Wisconsin.  Learned a lot in my time w/the group and have  verified the philosophy many times over thru other sources--but not the  predictions. Never saw a more committed group of fine people--the book is  worth a read but be careful. Richard is a very complex person, seems cool,  highly objective and intelligent both as RK and as Ejlal Kueshana, his pen  name. Haven't seen him since 1973.

Of course, the Holy Spirit is  still the primary source of all &quot;how-to's&quot;, but the information  MacNutt offers is invaluable.  Also recommend Noel and Phyl Gibson's  Evicting Demonic Intruders and Rebecca Brown's He Came to Set the Captives  Free.

I ordered it prior to  publication, as the result of a search for books on &quot;quantum  computing,&quot; before I was able to read any reviews, and before I could  discover that by reading it I would learn nothing about quantum computing I  didn't already know. When it arrived, it seemed interesting anyway -- a  discourse on the (already familiar) many-worlds interpretation of QM from a  true enthusiast, something I myself have never been. Should I have been?  That's the question this book might have answered.<br />As far as the book's  entertainment value, I tend to agree with the reader who called it  &quot;pompous, pretentious and worse of all extremely boring to read.&quot;  Still, I'm not about to quarrel with readers who say things like &quot;I  really liked this,&quot; or even &quot;it fires up the mind.&quot; Tastes  are very personal, and even I might have said something like that at some  other stage of life.<br />But what is so disappointing about many of the  reviews is that the reviewers are obviously confused about the distinction  between a scientific theory and a theoretic interpretation. A couple of  examples: One reader called the central idea of the book  &quot;non-sense&quot; and went on to say that &quot;this book is built of  figments that cannot be verified experimentally because of their very  definition&quot; (no extra credit for agreeeing with me on one star).  Another says, &quot;his theory of parallel universes is one of the most  elegant theories in physics today.&quot; I could go on, but that would be  as boring as the book itself.<br />Obviously, you can't verify that other  parallel universes exist, in any measurable way. But one does not ask an  interpretation for verification. For example, it isn't possible to prove  that the Sun and notthe Earth is the center of the solar system, but  thinking that way makes the planetary orbits a lot easier to understand.  That's why even a doubter like myself is willing to consider the  possibility of a many-worlds interpretation: Some bright guy may show you  that things you once thought were hard to understand, are easy. The long  and the short of is -- Deutsch is not that guy.	1999-09-18

The first 5 pages fixed that. The effort of the author is amazing in the amount  of research and the accurate descriptions of unit organization, weapons,  and tactics that are used in Special Operations. The unit descriptions,  attitudes and characterization of the individual units are all right on  target. Having met the Task Force Commander in a Florida swamp years ago,  it automatically verified the authors account. Mark Bowden does an  excellent job. The story speaks for itself, a harrowing look into an  intense military operation that goes south. Most impressive is the amazing  character,  heroism and loyalty of modern day young Americans and the price  that they voluntarily pay to serve the greatest country in the world. With  soldiers like this it is easy to understand how we are in that position. A  great book.	1999-09-15

The beauty of it is that these incredible interviews provide unquestionable authority as they are the only three interviews that  can be verified through audio and video tape as being legitimately Bruce  Lee and expressing his honest views and beliefs. Every other book contains  quotes from Bruce Lee (I exclude the Tuttle series of books which are based  upon his original writings)but never the context from which they are taken.  The format of this book is also very agreeable; John Little (the editor and  world's foremost authority on Bruce Lee) has actually tracked down the  three individuals who recorded these interviews with Lee and obtained their  insights and recollections on their dialogues with Bruce Lee. Absolutely  brilliant! I have never -- ever -- seen this done in a book before. I hope  that Mr. Little (who's other book &quot;The Warrior Within&quot; is without  question the best presentation of Bruce Lee's philosophy I have ever  read)is planning on continuing to write more books on Lee's thought as  these books have only whetted my appetite for more authentic teachings of  Bruce Lee.

Imagine a novel about Hitler's life at the apex of his power over subjugated peoples:  a life without any  kind of moral standards and subject to no laws.  Imagine that novel with  plenty of juicy sex and violence, with Hitler having a pretty good time  throughout, to provide a reader lots of vicarious thrills.  Transplanted to  pre-1860 Alabama, we have &quot;Mandingo&quot;.<br />From a literary  standpoint, I do not think &quot;Mandingo&quot; is a  terrible book.  It is  competently written.  The dialogue is convincing, and the characters are  consistent.  It's exciting.  It provides some historical detail of customs  and superstitions that may be verified elsewhere (for instance, in  &quot;Bullwhip Days&quot;, a superb collation of interviews with  ex-slaves).<br />From a broader, non-literary standpoint, &quot;Mandingo&quot;  is pretty bad.  Parts of the story are disgusting, and the author surely  intended those parts to titillate the reader and increase sales.  Much of  the book is sure to insult or infuriate black readers.<br />I would say that  &quot;Mandingo&quot; is a major work, by an author who knew his craft but  felt no need to be socially responsible.  I first read &quot;Mandingo&quot;  when I was fourteen.  At that time, I thought it was exciting but silly.   Thirty years later, I find it exciting, shocking, and sad, but not the  least bit silly.  I recommend the book only to readers who won't mind being  offended, and I recommend that parents keep it away from children.	1999-09-07

The truth is often more amazing than fiction as this true story shows.  It centers around three very benevolent ghosts who assume the duties of watching over the family (and their guests) who live in a house where three  people have died in days gone by.  It's a family story, related by the  father and verified through documentation. Since the narrator is an adult,  I'd classify the book as for adults.  It's high interest with low reading  level so that it could be enjoyed by adults learning English as a second  language.  Kids ages 9-14 would enjoy the story, but they may not like  having it related by an adult. Some parents will  find the use of an Ouiga  board and the consulting of a medium to be objectionable.  Nevertheless the  story is told well, the characters ring true, and the reader will come away  with new ideas to ponder insofar as ghosts are concerned.  Recommended for  readers who like ghost stories.	1999-09-05

Yet, Bodansky's web of global conspiracy hinges on untested assumptions and unverified claims  stitched together by an Islamic-phobia that belongs in a previous century.  Bodansky shows his analytical weakness by lumping together every so-called  Islamist from the Maghreb to Mindanao in a mythical anti-Western crusade.  Bodansky falls within a long line of so-called policy analysts who have  invented the clash of civilizations thesis by promoting fear and demonizing  the other. Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist, yet he is hardly the face nor  mastermind of a world wide Islamist militant movement. He is an extremist,  isolated by his theological and violent beliefs, with marginal support  among the mainstream Muslim intelligentsia, professional groups, and  working classes, dangerous to the West and the Muslim world equally.	1999-09-02

I've done exactly what you have suggested many times in the past. I'll add up all my buys during a downward slide and come up with an average price. I've added up all my sells during a market climb and averaged the price.  Guess what, it's always profitable.     It isn't so much that AIM works  better than flawless trading, it's just that it rarely loses money for the  user. Of last year's 85 taxable events in my own account only 13 were at a  loss. Those losses were very minor. Of the 13 losses 7 were short term losses. Most of the gains are long term most years (think about the tax savings). My porfolio turnover rate was about 28% and my AVERAGE capital gain for 1998 was 38% including all losses.      I don't think Mr. Lichello  wanted us to be mindless robots working the market. Nor did he indicate  that his method couldn't be improved. Over the course of years, I've taken  the basic AIM model and \\"personalized\\" it. The simple  improvements I've made didn't take a massive amount of skull sweat, and  were easily verified as effective when tested by computer spreadsheet (over  18 years of data).     Even further improvements are still under way by  others with whom I correspond. Such items as making the various parameter  adjustments using an Artificial Intelligence override to continually  optimize the settings.     Please look again at the AIM model, not as a  straight jacket but as an example of what investing is supposed to be -  profitable. It is a risk management model. There's always a balance between  risk and reward. If AIM reduces risk, guess what, it probably has a reward  penalty as well. Some of us just might be retired and want to moderate our  risk and be willing to sacrifice a bit of performance.     Most AIM users  with whom I correspond have been happy to modify Mr. Lichello's basic model  for their own ways of investing. I think Mr. Lichello's model is a licence  to use it as we see fit and not a rigid profile that can't be changed. Try  splitting SAFE into two separate components. Give each its own weighting  relative to the Resistance to buying or selling you want. Try limiting the  total level of Cash Reserve to a percentage of the portfolio's value. Quit  selling when the Cash Reserve gets too FAT. Bump Portfolio Control up  instead. All these things work.     AIM is a closed loop control algorithm  with a positive feedback loop. One can also adjust the rate, reset value,  and intensity of the feedback to vary the performance of the model.     I'm  not sure a two year period is long enough of a test period to show AIM's  potential. Mr. Lichello's hypothetical model uses 16 price cycles to take  $10,000 to his million dollar goal. That's more cycles than can be expected  in a two year period.     AIM needs to have significant downward price  events periodically to restock the shelves with certificates. Since 1982  we've only had three events of any size to generate much buying by AIM. I  don't think Mr. Lichello anticipated the 1982 to 1999 bull run when he  designed AIM. It's been up to the users to modify AIM for use in a bull  market.     Remember, just because AIM doesn't fit with your methods doesn't  mean that it doesn't work. If there were to be an arguement brought about  in analysis of AIM's activity, it might be the \\"time-value\\" of  AIM trades has cash being spent a bit early. However, since AIM is being  paid for maintaining a cash reserve in the form of interest, this is  somewhat nullified.     Thanks for responding to my post. I'm glad to see  the critics are up to my challenges! AIM does not violate the principle of  Buy Low, Sell High. Most Short Term Traders leave massive amounts of value  \\"on the table\\" by selling out too soon. I bought VTSS in 1993. As  a trader it's offered many opportunities to sell out profitably. However,  it's offered very few chances to get back in. Who would have done best? ST  Trader? AIMer? Buy&Hold. In that case, Buy & Hold kicks butt.  However, I'm still a substantial holder as well. Current profits are about  1300% and I see no reason to end the ride. ST Traders missed most of the  ride.    Best regards, oldcat@execpc.com	1999-08-25

He analyzes all 17 of the show's episodes, explores  some of the behind-the-scenes production problems, and offers the strengths  and weaknesses of the overall show and individual episodes.    Muir's theme  is that Galactica, warts and all, was nonetheless an entertaining and  thought-provoking series that didn't deserve the kind of criticisms it got  from the likes of sci-fi author David Gerrold and horror author Stephen  King - Muir reprints blasts by those two and others against the show,  blasts that display the ever-indefensible strain of elitist snobbery  distressingly common to sci-fi.      Muir's strongest insight lies in his  analysis of the show's hawkish view of war-and-piece issues.  Sci-fi tends  to be drearily pacifistic, based not on any realworld context but on sheer  myth. Battlestar Galactica was different, and remains such even today.  The  show's hawkish philosophy is based on what has happened in the real world,  not on the dreams of pacifists.  Galactica's viewpoint has been repeatedly  verified throughout history; where, for instance, can the one-world pacific viewpoint of Star Trek be verified in the real world?    There are naturally  areas where one can disagree with Mr. Muir - his analyses of the episodes  Lost Planet Of The Gods and Gun On Ice Planet Zero are absurdly harsh; in  GOIPZ he repeats the valid but misunderstood criticism that the Fleet could  have simply bypassed the Cylon-armed planetoid, never realizing that the  Fleet is in effect surrounded by Cylon base stars and cannot do such an  end-run  - and he overanalyzes cliches within the show, such as the  court-martial cliche used in Murder On The Rising Star.      Muir's overall  analysis, though, is spot-on.  He recognizes Battlestar Galactica as an  enjoyable and thought-provoking series, and includes a list of tenrecomended changes for revival of the series.  Some of these recommended changes have found their way into the SCI-FI Network's well-made reimagining of Galactica, and Muir's recommended changes can serve as  rules to be applied to any film genre - the  bad-guys-who-can't-shoot-straight cliche in particular has to be changed.  Before the SCI-FI Network's series, many of these recommendations were employed in the Maximum Press and Realm Press versions of Galactica and in Richard Hatch's novels.    It all proves the durability of a sci-fi series wrongly dismissed then and later.	1999-08-05

Jones gives examples that are easily verified using any spreadsheet package.  While I could go on for hours raving about  the book's great points, I do want to point out three flaws that he  discusses, 2 only in passing comments and the other being the root of his  money management technique.  In ever so brief statements, Ryan downplays  the use of neural nets to assist in trading.  He also states in passing  that one can only expect to earn $3,000 - $5,000 per contract per year in  the T-Bond futures arena.  Having just begun my futures trading career two  and one-half weeks ago using a neural net I developed to call position  trades in the T-Bond market, I have profited $2,700 after commissions and  am shooting for $30,000 - $50,000 over the course of a year.  The point,  don't knock nueral net's ability to discern market inefficiencies.  The  last point deals with Jones' contention that one can grow $100,000 in  profits on a per contract basis to $1,000,000 using his fixed ratio method.   This statement is true, but only in a world of zero income taxes!  Even  accounting for this major overlooked flaw, his money management technique  is unmatched by anyone and is one I will follow as I contimue to trade  futures.	1999-07-31

Although the title touts  that it is the Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art, it is not for  several reasons. First is that the history section falls way short (1 page?  w/o photos) of giving insight and history to Korea's version of martial  arts. Second is that all of the technical material has already been  published and comes from Grandmaster Kee Hwang's original Korean text  &quot;Soo Bahk Do Dae Gahm&quot; (1970) and from the English translations  (1975 &amp; 1992) which covers History, detailed Scientific analysis of  techniques and Hyung (form) through 6th Dan level. Third, is that the  technical expertise of those persons photographed leave something to be  desired. The Chil Sung Hyungs were preliminarily introduced in 1952  (verified by Choi Wui Suk who actually saw them) not the latter half of  1980's. Now for the interesting parts. The Tang Soo Do historical photos  are always great (specifically pages 16-17). The Moo Duk Kwan's family tree  helps in understanding heritage. The overview of Hyungs is useful in  getting a sense as to the pattern's overall shape (at a glance) and also  come from  &quot;Soo Bahk Do Dae Gahm&quot; except for the Chil Sung  Hyungs. For the price, the book is a nice information source but for more  detailed information the serious martial artist should get Grandmaster Kee  Hwang's English texts.	1999-07-23

It will take you to a  level of depth that you choose, and it will introduce you to a modicum of  fascinating mathematical culture in the process.  The book is artfully  written, contains amusing anecdotes and inspiring quotations, and is a fine  model of scientific exposition.  I recommend it with  enthusiasm.&quot;<br />UMAP Journal 20 (1) (1999) 85-90  <br />Steven G. Krantz,  Mathematics Dept., Washington University, Box 1146, One Brookings Dr., St.  Louis, MO  63130-4899; sk@math.wustl.edu<br /> The past fifteen years have  seen an explosion of activity in the field of wavelets.  Rarely have we  seen ideas from theoretical mathematics filter so rapidly into the applied  arena.  Conferences on wavelets are attended in droves, both by  mathematicians and by engineers.  The online journal Wavelet Digest  [Sweldens 1999] is said to have 12,000 subscribers.  The \\"nattering  nabob of negativism\\" (This phrase is due to Vice-President Spiro Agnew  (1918-1996), September 1970) will point out that wavelets have their roots  in Littlewood-Paley theory, and that that branch of harmonic analysis is 70  years old.  With 20/20 hindsight, one can now see that wavelets were  already contained in the Calderón reproducing formula of the 1960s.  Old  papers in artificial intelligence, in physics, and in signal processing can  be said to have contained the germ of the idea of wavelets.  True enough,  but almost any idea in mathematics has roots that can be traced back some  years.  Wavelets offer a number of novelties to the Fourier analyst:<br />That  he can choose \\"basis elements\\" for his Fourier analysis that are suited to  the specific application at hand,<br />that he need not be slavishly tied to  the notion that the basis elements must be orthogonal,<br />that simultaneous  localization in both the space and phase variables is possible, and<br />that  convergence issues for wavelets often are simpler to understand than the  corresponding  convergence issues for (as an example) Fourier series.<br />The  applications of wavelet theory to image processing, signal processing,  fingerprint analysis and compression, filtering of musical signals,  electrocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, biological neural systems,  and many other branches of hard science have been profound and influential.    These are just a few of the dozens of examples.  Wavelets have actually  changed the way that people think about harmonic analysis problems.  ...  there is a paucity of books introducing wavelets to the layman--perhaps  (very roughly speaking) as James Gleick [1988] introduced the public to the  putative theory of chaos.  The book under review is actually much  better than Gleick [1998], because it is written by someone who has worked  hard to understand the subject matter, who has checked and verified her  work with numerous authorities, who has studiously avoided flash and glitz,  and who can present the subject with some depth and texture.  As a signal  of the quality of Hubbard's book, it was recently awarded the Prix  d'Alembert.  (Note that d'Alembert is famous in part for his studies of the  heat equation, one of the first scientific problems to be treated with  Fourier analysis.)  Hubbard begins in a gentle manner, acquainting the  reader with the anomalous life of Fourier and his astonishing contributions  to scientific thought.  She describes Fourier series and how they are used.   She segues into a history of nineteenth-century analysis, telling of the  development of the Fourier transform.  Along the way, she skillfully  introduces the problem of simultaneously localizing both the space and the  phase variables; as she puts it, the Fourier transform tells us what(musical) note is being played, but not when.  This setup gives a  beautiful entrée to the basic idea of wavelets.  Most of us are aware of  wavelets today because star Fourier analyst Yves Meyer was comfortable  swapping ideas with engineers and physicists.  A signal-processing problem  that had captured their attention struck a chord with Meyer, and the rest  is history.  Hubbard gives a charming rendition of this critical part of  the wavelet legend.  ... There are many delightful figures, computer  printouts, and illustrations to amplify the principles being discussed.    Hubbard wisely divides her book into three parts.  The first is truly  heuristic:  It is written for the science &quot;groupie&quot; who has no  technical knowledge whatever.  Beginning on p. 111 is the portion entitled  &quot;Beyond Plain English,&quot; which actually begins to show some  mathematics.  Here we encounter the language of functions, function spaces,  bases, filters, and transform theory.  Section 17 of this part contains a  very pretty collection of tables summarizing the key features of various  transforms.  The last part of the book--actually a collection of  Appendices--becomes quite technical, and even includes a proof of the  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  The jaded theoretical mathematician  might object that this book concentrates too much on applications and too  little on the beautiful wavelet theory.  But we must keep in mind the  audience: A person who hardly knows what a function is will not appreciate  that wavelets provide an unconditional basis for the Hardy space H1, nor  appreciate the finer properties of a multiresolution analysis.  Instead,  such a person will appreciate the mathematics because it can be used for  something more familiar.  That is the point of view of this book.  I  hate advertisements that cheerily profess their product to offer  &quot;something for  everyone.&quot;  Such hyperbole oft bespeaks a tired  and obvious disingenuousness: thatthe artifact being promoted offers  nothing for anyone.  But I might dare apply the phrase to this book.  If  you would like to know what wavelet theory is about--be you student,  mathematician, or avid nonscientific reader with broad interests--then this  book will give you more than a nodding acquaintance.  It will take you to a  level of depth that you choose, and it will introduce you to a modicum of  fascinating mathematical culture in the process.  The book is artfully  written, contains amusing anecdotes and inspiring quotations, and is a fine  model of scientific exposition.  I recommend it with  enthusiasm.<br />	1999-07-22

The book doesn't explain why people believe weird things, define what weird is, or make clear what the author believes is far, far weirder. For  better takes, see \\"The Universe Next Door\\"(Sire), \\"Modern  Degenerates\\"(Jones), \\"New Atheism and the Erosion of  Freedom\\"(Morey).<br /><br />The book's Skepticism is an oddly selective  defense of the status quo. Consider this list:<br /><br />A) Darwinian biology  (and the derived political science of Marx/Lenin and the eugenic/racial science of  Hitler's National-Socialists (NAZI's) and Margaret Sanger)<br />B) Freudian  psychological science<br />C) Anthropological science (Margaret  Mead)<br />D) Economic science (John Maynard Keynes)<br />E) Sexual behavior  science (Alfred Kinsey)<br /><br />Shermer critiques none of these, though the  ideas summarize the 20th-century. Each was revolutionary scientific  understanding. Each was built into day-to-day beliefs of most people.<br /><br />After decades, it was discovered B-E above were scientific frauds.<br /><br /> \\"A\\", while originally legitimate science, was foundation for  political/social theories that savaged the century with 100+ million deaths  and the enslavement of billions. It is gradually being turned into a modern  fraud, as contradicting knowledge accumulates, but is swept under the  rug.<br /><br />Freud constructed a model of human psychology revolving around  sex, even as he found it necessary to kick his wife out of bed to sleep  with his sister-in-law. Now dismissed as the product of his emotional  problems, Freudian psychology continues to influence.<br /><br />Margaret Mead  went to Somoa, reporting a paradise where \\"celibacy was  meaningless\\",\\"marriages form and dissolve  easily\\",\\"casual homosexuality was the usual form of  relations...\\". 1920's intellectuals thrilled to the realization of  their compulsions and elimination of Original-Sin. Thus was invented  \\"cultural-relativism\\".  In the 1980's, it was learned Mead  (married) couldn't speak Somoan and fabricated her account to relieve guilt  over lesbian affairs.<br /><br />Keynes developed deficit economics (spend today,  shift payment to future generations) which funded the welfare state and is  accumulating trillions in unpaid debt.  Based on what has come to be  realized as a homosexual vision of a childless future, Keynes writings  describe his desire to make heterosexual culture pay for marginalizing the  \\"good life\\" of homosexuality. Keynseian science was eagerly  accepted because it expanded government control.<br /><br />Kinsey's 1948 book on  sexual behavior was perhaps the most carefully built scientific fraud.  Drawing on captive populations of prisoners, many incarcerated for sex  crimes, he constructed a statistical model of human sexual behavior, then  projected it onto the public. He then concealed the nature of the sample  population. It was a shock to most (delight to others) that science showed  those behaviors were \\"normal\\", kicking off the 60's sexual  revolution. All to legitimize Kinsey's personal interests. See  \\"Kinsey, Sex and Fraud\\" (Reisman).<br /><br />And Darwin. Father of them  all. Defining a human being as a soulless bit of matter produced by random  occurences, lacking divine nature, he laid the ground-work for Marx who  correctly saw Darwinism as the foundation for atheistic materialism. Nazism  is another logical extension of Darwin; why shouldn't evolution be advanced  by weeding out people based on scientific (natural) criteria? Survival of  the fittest justifies any result, being circular reasoning. Thus comes  eugenics and abortion; if a fetus is a bit of matter unrelated to God, why  would it have any \\"right\\" to exist? Human rights are based on the  biblical idea that man is made in the image of God thus has intrinsic  worth. There is no other basis. (One reason the idea of human rights  translates poorly into countries lacking Christian backgrounds.) Darwin  defined reproduction as life's purpose, energizing Freud and the others.<br /><br />Darwinism, as science, is in shambles.  See \\"Mere  Creation\\"(Dembski), \\"Darwin's Black  Box\\"(Behe), and  \\"Genesis Question\\" (Ross).<br /><br />The author accepts the weirdest  beliefs, quoting Kinsey, unaware the research was discredited. How can a  \\"baloney detector\\" be so uniformly turned askew? The author  writes:<br /><br />\\"The flaw in pure skepticism is that when taken to an  extreme ... it cannot stand. If you are skeptical of everything, you must  be skeptical of your own skepticism.\\"  WPBWT rejects purity. The  baloney detector can point anywhere but at science-wrapped Skepticism.<br /><br />But there are two aspects of science: method (testing ideas) and philosophy  (a set of assumptions; the idea all is 100% material in cause). The METHOD  of science is biblical and common-sense, producing helpful tools. The  PHILOSOPHY of science is problematic. It helps the method by forcing  identification of all material causes. But a non-material cause is  unrecognizable, and science spins in circles--the provisional nature of  scientific knowledge.<br /><br />The materialistic assumption of  science-philosophy is attractive to some. Previously, everyone was  accountable to God. If materialism is true, that goes away (because God  & souls wouldn't exist).  It releases one from moral accountability to  a higher power.  Thus the Trojan horse: \\"Science (the method)  makes Sony Walkmans and so many things possible, but can't find  water-dowsers. Thus, science (the materialistic philosophy) must be  correct.\\" This is a seductive logical fallacy.<br /><br />Here are truly  weird beliefs the book implicitly promotes:<br /><br />  1. There are no absolutes.  (The statement claims absolute knowledge, contradicting itself. Are there  no absolutes or there are people who PREFER there be no absolutes?)<br />  2.  Everything is relative. (Contradicts itself, being another absolute  assertion of truth even as it claims there are none.)<br />  3. We can't knowanything with certainty. (Asserts an absolute truth as it claims one is not  possible. Self-refuting.)<br />  4. What a person believes is the result of  social, psychological or chemical conditioning. (Then that belief is also  the result of such conditioning.)<br />  5. There is no truth. (If true, the  statement is an example contradicting it's assertion. Another impossible  statement that excludes itself.)<br />  6. Only empirically verifiable or  falsifiable statements have any meaning. (This idea cannot be verified, and  prohibits itself from being assumed true, thus is impossible.)<br /><br />While  Holocaust-deniers, UFO-abductees & witch-crazed may be in error, they  cannot be as wrong as the author, whose underlying beliefs can't be  expressed without contradiction by the end of the sentence. They are  beliefs of desire, not reality.<br /><br />The book advances demented humanism in  the disguise of rationality, by attacking simple error and hoping no one  dares looks at those doing the critique...	1999-07-21

Different flavor, same nutritional values.  I howled over the nightmare in the opening scene where our heroine is forced to drink diet pop instead of  sweet tea and threatened with cornbread that has sugar in it. One mistake  caught my eye.  The Biltmore has not ever been and is not now a public  property.  It is owned by the grandson of the man who built it.  It is run  as a very much for profit business. They (the Cecil family, Bill's momma  was Cornelia Vanderbilt)pride themselves that they have never received a  penny of either state or federal funding to keep the old pile from falling  down.  Of course, some of the things they have done in the way of  maintenance would make a curator cringe but that's their business.  At any  rate - Ms. Myer really should have verified that piece of information  before going to press.	1999-07-05

US	52585489	R1WC2ORTQMWGVM	0345412885	58749141	Truth Machine	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Clear and credible - to a point	The book &quot;The Truth Machine&quot;, even with several logic flaws and a general literary awkwardness, is a brave attempt to offer one scenario of a technologically dominated future.  More books of this type need to be  written and critiqued in order for us to form a clearer picture of what the  future may hold in the way of dangers and opportunities.  The more that  people engage in such a dialogue about the future, the better our prospects  are for democratic control of such a future.  In this respect, I found it  refreshing that the author would be brave enough to reveal such a scenario.  <br />The author writes from the point of view that he is actually a very  advanced computer, capable of imitating the writing style of its owner.   This he apparently uses in order to cover a documentary-like approach to  the plot that is rather lackluster literarily.  However, I can excuse this  as a book that is intended not for its form as much as for its  content.<br />It is not easy to take into account enough factors to make any  such scenario or model of the future multi-dimensional.  There are so many  interacting factors that one will err either on the side of irrelevancy if  one tries to be too all-inclusive of facts, or on the side of  oversimplification if one paints the picture with too large a brush.  The  author has gone to great lengths to try to take into account such  complexities, and it is notable.  On the other hand, the omissions are  glaring to anyone looking at the book both critically and objectively.   <br />The main character Pete Armstrong in the book is given so much  intellectual influence and power that it strains the limits of one's  credibility.  Similarly, the notion that Pete's only intellectual equals  are his deceased brother Leonard and his evil nemesis, is equally  far-fetched.  While there are individuals such as Einstein, Gandhi, and  Lincoln that can single-handedly change society for the better, Pete's  intellectual prowess is so overstated by the author as to iconize him in a  way that makes this prowess seem something more than human, consequently  something less than real.  The treatment of his character by the author is  a bit more realistic and complex than the treatment of his intellect as an  isolated feature of his character, but again, the author's attempts to make  him seem larger than life result in creating someone who seems less than  lifelike.  At the end of the book, society's worst fear is that Pete (and  only Pete) will undo his invention by coming up with an algorithm (in his  sleep) that allows this machine to be circumvented.  Mind you, it is  assumed that no one else will ever be able to come up with such an  algorithm.  Such an assumption is highly unrealistic.<br />The characters of  David West and Diane Hsu are similarly &quot;too perfect&quot;.  David is  granted too much credibility, his intuitive instincts too much credit.  The  one time he believes he made an error in judgment, he ends up instead  sounding like the old cliché that goes, &quot;I thought I was wrong once,  but I was mistaken.&quot;  The reader is left feeling that these characters  somehow lack something of the complexity we call &quot;human&quot;.<br />As  the plot unfolds, the public officials in general are more esteemed by  society than any such equivalent persons whom we presently know in our  society.  This actually points to the underlying premise of the book,  which, stated simply, amounts to a belief that outer technology can  actually cause people to become better human beings inside.  Upon  examination, the reason for this premise becomes increasingly clear: The  author believes that all reality, including that which we call  consciousness and even &quot;self-consciousness&quot;, is created by  external factors alone.  This, however, conflicts with any definition of  self-consciousness as an internal sense of &quot;I&quot; within the  organism.  Early in the book the author vicariously (through Pete) explains  away all near-death experiences as the defense mechanisms of a dying brain,  and confirms this belief later in the book through the &quot;scientific  discoveries&quot; he projects.  Therefore, according to the author, even  self-consciousness is an event &quot;created&quot; by outside factors  alone.<br />This flaw I believe is the exact reason why and point where the  book goes astray from any but the most reductionistic world view.  To my  way of thinking, truth is an individual pursuit involving introspection and  subjective experience, certainly much more complex than a mere Boolean  value that can be verified or negated by even the most sophisticated EEG.   When we use the word &quot;truth&quot; instead of &quot;fact&quot; we are  dealing with intangibles and matters of opinion, certainly nothing that a  machine can second-guess with 100% accuracy.<br />The notion that such a  machine, accompanied by no corresponding changes in the way our children  are raised, can cause an already violent society to reform itself into an  honest and gentle society, is ludicrous.  The author even goes as far as to  suggest  that the death penalty itself, contrary to any current statistics,  is a deterrent to violent crime when it becomes ubiquitous and is applied  evenly.  This I consider a &quot;law-and-order pipe dream&quot;: if we lock  enough people and the right people away, society will improve.  What about  all the factors that made these individuals aberrant to begin with?  Are  these not to be considered?<br />If this author had written a book before the  creation of the television, would he have articulated an equally sanguine  scenario about the wonderful device that single-handedly turned society  into a literate and informed group? Were the truth machine to exist, would  the government actually pay for it, or would the lawmakers form the basis  of the opposition against such a device?  Consider the number of  politicians who are untruthful andseek to exclude themselves from any  regulation that necessarily involves them.  I would logically surmise that  government would be the last to incorporate this invention into their way  of doing business.	1999-06-17

I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a real solution to struggles with their weight.  Whether you are slim and constanly fighting to stay there, or morbidly obese, this is a viable solution.   Reading  &quot;7 Secrets&quot;, you'll  learn how and why you'll get fatter by  dieting.   My 'naturally slim' friends have verified that the 'secrets'  revealed in the book are how they actually eat and percieve food.  What I  especially like about this book is the work sheets for each day of the  seven weeks of the program.  Worksheets  make it very easy to transform the  &quot;7 Secrets&quot; into your everyday life.   I read the book cover to  cover before beginning the worksheets and I recommend that you do too.    The difference it is making in my life and my relationship with food is  amazing.  I have learned to eat food that makes me feel good, as a result,  I am eating healthier and  far less.  I have learned to recognize when a  food makes me feel bad so I can avoid it.   It is psychologically freeing  to be able to eat whatever you want, whenever you want it. I look and feel  better than I have in 9 years and the weight is falling off effortlessly.   The best part is,  there is no dieting. You just have to be willing to  relearn everything you thought about eating.	1999-06-01

Karl Popper has warned us of the blindness of mankind to his own prejudices.  To avoid this some contemporaries are &quot;deconstructing&quot; the current culture.  They would be well served  to read Dr. Reisman's book.  Kinsey reduced the human community into a  colony mentality.  Sex became not a socialization process for the moral and  most human in us, but for the hedonistic and catatonic.                          Fortunately, &quot;justice&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot; have no  'statue of limitations', Judith Reisman's book should be the reason for  reopening your readings on the Nuerenbury War Trials  and their roots in  the antithesis of &quot;objectity&quot;.  Sadly, it shows that many  american scientists and policy makers were not very far apart in their  morality from either the Nazi or from the Bolshevik.  <br />        The  historical roots of the interplay of culture, morality, politics, and even  aesthetics should surprise no one. But, a concrete documentation of the  extension of Nieztsche's iconoclastics into the ethical and political  targeting of the 'family and community' is here.<br />      Dr. Reisman has  set in motion the need for examining very carefully the current explosion  of information coming out of the postwar years. The &quot;Freedom of  Information&quot; files that are now available under court order from the  A. Hiss trials are only one example of the adding of names and  personalities to many of those shadow entities who made policy decisions  from the '30's until the present.  <br />     Wars may end, but the cultural  clashes that gave rise to them are ultimately moral clashes. These outlast  the thrust and cut of the conflict and are enshrined in the character (or  lack of it) within the human being. <br />     Dr. Reisman has documented this  with precision and clarity.  Will we ask the next set of necessary  questions?  Are Kinsy's methods and reputedly 'scientific' decisions still  effecting our society?  Were they ever justified scientifically?  Did  Kinsey's work ever do more than promote his own &quot;religious  convictions&quot; of the nature of science?  Did a transposed entymologist  really have the credentials or the credibility to respectably do the work  that he was supposed to have verified?  Why was he accepted so uncritically  by the American psychological establishment?  How could Kinsey's work,  especially with its allegiances and fellow travelers with the Nazi party  have received suçh enormous credibilty with the the American psychological  movements, the  Rockerfeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the  federal government?<br />      Were all of the &quot;scientific&quot; and  public entities merely reaffirming Karl Popper's claim:  'Science&quot; is  just as much a prisoner of its own paradigms as any other ideology has  been?'Read in between the lines, ask behind the lines and study the lines  of Dr. Reisman's book and you will be able to answer this question for  yourself! But, we should really be focused on the follow up books from Dr.  Reisman and from others on these issues.  (SSC, Salem, MA: 1999)	1999-05-26

As my first and last reading in postmodernism, what immediately stood out was the turgid obscurity of the writing. Random page:<br /><br />\\"Apel's rebuttal of Albert's anti-foundationalist argument via the charge of  performative contradiction assumes that the a priori validity of logical  rules must be assumed\\". Example would be nice, but definitions and  examples are scarce and would cramp the author's style.<br /><br />After a few  pages, a greater realization: one can read for pages and not encounter an  actual idea.  Words, chosen for ambiguity, arranged on paper so as to have  no meaning when considered in sequence.<br /><br />The book is unimportant in two  ways: it is hypocritical and has no utility.  It is an abstract game in  which the author depends on 3rd-order natural-language word definitions to  avoid committing to anything specific. Well, almost.<br /><br />ON IT'S OWN  TERMS, the book is necessarily a final (meta)attempt to provide the  universal mechanism to avoid \\"cognitive dissonance\\", the  discomfort felt when exposed to another viewpoint. But that assumes that  cognitive dissonace is something all seek to avoid.  Thus, there is the  rejection of absolutes, itself based on a specific assertion -- the assumed  universal/absolute desire to resolve cognitive dissonance.<br /><br />Given the  record of intellectuals and academia in jumping on-board intellectual  frauds from Marxism to Keynesian economics to Freudian psychology to Kinsey  sexuality (See \\"Degenerate Moderns\\" by Jones) only to see them  collapse in ruins of error after thousands of Ph.D's and careers were built  around them, post-modernism can be seen as a self-defense mechanism for  academia. An attempt to declare that all human reason is inadequate, there  being no truth. \\"We could only have failed so monstrously if human  reason itself is unreal\\".<br /><br />Self-centered arrogance. Human reason  is fine, albeit finite. It is demonstrably irrational assumptions of  academic elites that are unreal:<br /><br />  1. \\"There are no  absolutes\\".Comment: The statement claims absolute knowledge, thus  contradicts itself. (There is the temperature absolute zero. Has much to do  with entropy, thus the cause-effect direction of time, with all THOSE  consequences). Question: Do you suppose there are no absolutes or there are  people who PREFER there are no absolutes, so they can do what they want?<br /><br />  2. \\"Everything is relative\\". Comment: Contradicts itself, being  another absolute assertion of truth even as it claims there are none.  Meaningless.<br /><br />  3. \\"We can't know anything with certainty\\".  Comment: Except, it seems, this one belief. Which, being an example, is  thus self-refuting and meaningless. It asserts an absolute truth as it  claims one is not possible.<br /><br />  4. \\"What a person believes is the  result of social, psychological or chemical conditioning\\" Comment:  Then this belief is also the result of such conditioning, invalidating its  significance to an equal extent.<br /><br />  5. \\"There is no truth\\".  Comment: If true, the statement is an example contradicting it's assertion.  Another impossible statement that excludes itself.<br /><br />  6. \\"Only  empirically verifiable or falsifiable statements have any meaning\\".  Comment: This idea cannot be verified and prohibits itself from being  simply assumed true. It is thus impossible.<br /><br />Post-modernism was  invented to protect elites from the cognitive dissonance that comes with  recognizing the irrationality of the assumed \\"enlightened\\"  beliefs above. (That, and to amuse the French: \\"Jacques, I can't  believe the Americans bought into us AGAIN...finally, revenge for all those  'I Love Lucy' reruns.\\")<br /><br />Once these beliefs are recognized and  eliminated, human reason does well. The reasoning that requires the above  to be self-refuting statements allows one to construct the mathematics to  send a spacecraft 30 million miles to another planet and arrive within 100  meters. Human reason does well if started from a certain point.<br /><br />The  author, of course, doesn't deny any of this (and cannot), just constructs a  preemptive defensive fog of imprecise words so as to cover all bases  simultaneously. This fog is dependent on using implied but less common  alternate word definitions. For example, when trying to address the charge  of self-refutation, it turns out the charge must be  \\"unloaded\\".<br /><br />\\"Refutation\\" has too precise a  meaning, thus the post-modernist has to \\"unload\\" the charge of  self-refutation instead of \\"refuting\\" the charge of  self-refutation.  \\"Unload\\" is typically used with respect to  physical labor. By switching it to refer to a logical operation, the author  creates a vagueness of meaning that allows the reader to fill with  imagination or assumption.  Deeply dishonest, intentional  miscommunication.<br /><br />She writes \\"for the self-refutation charge to  have logical force (as officially measured), the mirror-reversal it  indicates must be exact\\". First, I wonder how, ON HER TERMS, she can  know this. Second, I wonder what \\"mirror-reversal\\" logic is.  Third, on her own terms, how and who \\"officially measures\\"  logical force\\"?<br /><br />There may be a suggestive parallel to  post-modernism in science. Mathematical reasoning often contains infinite  series summations, or sometimes, additional small terms in the expressions.  For computational reasons, these expressions are often truncated to an  approximation. Thus the spacecraft arrives 100 meters off target after 30  million miles. The error has little to do with the arbitrariness of human  reason. 3rd order and higher terms were deliberately neglected, not worth  carrying.<br /><br />I think post-modernists fixate on these infinite series  (without knowing about them, being verbalists), missing the bigger picture  that to put a spacecraft down within 100 meters conclusively demonstrates  successful reasoning of high order, including the precise boundaries of  what one doesn't know. I suppose covariance mapping would be shocking  revelation to a post-modernist.<br /><br />While the book is UNimportant ON ITS  OWN TERMS with respect to reason, it is very significant for academia. It  promotes intellectual suicide of the current ruling elite that has failed  so badly.  Even as modern academics eat this stuff up to protect themselves  from facing the awful recognition of the concretely false assumptions of  humanism that frame their lives, it nullifies their intellectual existence  and prepares for the collapse of degenerate institutions, making way for  the new. Thus, some hope; the dead-wood is clearing itself. If it doesn't  go fascist, universities might be in good shape in 20-30 years.	1999-05-24

Mr. Greene makes it very easy for the lay readers to grasp the basic understanding of some out  of this world concepts, such as extra dimensions and vibrating strings.  I  am a professional engineer with years of training in math and physics,  however, I enjoyed the non-technical way Professor Greene has written this  book.  After reading this book I had a much better understanding of quantum  mechanics, relativity, and the string theory, and enjoyed reading the whole  book from beginning to the end.<br />Some of the reviewers have faulted  Professor Greene for communicating his ideas without using complicated  mathematics.  To me, this is one of strengths of this and other similar  books that are written for the lay people.  Those readers who are  mathematical geniuses can find plenty of other resources to suit their  taste.  Others think that it is inappropriate to write about incomplete  theories that cannot be experimentally verified at the present time.  This  is absurd.  This is what the progress of science is all about.  I thank  Brian Greene for sharing his ideas so clearly with the rest of us.  I am  going to talk to my young daughter about this book in the hopes of  inspiring her to someday join the minds who want to unlock the mysteries of  our universe.	1999-05-24

When I originally purchased and began to read Talbot's presentation, I was intrigued by the way he proposed to explain some of the mysterious or unexplained phenomena of the past and present through an honest inquiry. He  applied a blend of both scientific theory and speculations from traditional  mysticism to the table. He includes discussions of some of the stranger  aspects of quantum physics that have challenged modern physicists with  their counter-intuitiveness and introduces the concept of the HOLOGRAPH as  a possible model of reality. Yet he feels the need to combine these points  with paranormal or &quot;supernatural&quot; mysteries from the past, as  well as his own experiences. In the end, however, he clearly veers towards  his own assumptions and uncritically accepts much of the dubious  superstitions and supernatural claims of less enlightened historical times.  He does not actually present any real evidence for his argument or  hypothesis, but descends into personal anecdotes (i.e. unverified claims)  about his own bizzare &quot;experiences&quot;(hallucinations?). The book is  interesting up to a point, but quickly degenerates into yet another  &quot;New Age&quot; attempt to elevate magical-spiritual-supernatural  nonsense to the level of legitimate and testable science. Very unfortunate  indeed.	1999-05-07

Seaxton and Betts, editors of the AMERICAN ARCHITECT magazine in 1927-30, compiled this originally two volume display of photographs, drawings, plans, and renderings of some 100 then new theatres.  It is a  somewhat technical gallery of how architects met the challenge of designing  theatres for the multiple use concept then becoming commonplace, but its  multitude of photos will delight anyone interested in the physical nature  of theatres. This one-volume reprint contains an added Index to the  theatres therein, but the non-glossy paper is not as faithful to the photos  as is the glossy paper of the first edition, still to be seen in some  libraries. Still, the first edition is absolutely unobtainable, and this  edition is more than adequate! The 342 pages of this handsome hardbound  book should please anyone who loves beautiful theatres as well as the  somewhat technically oriented text. There are, of course, a few typos such  as the caption being wrong for the lower left photo on page 58 of  &quot;book 1&quot; (section) which is identified correctly on page 15, and  the photo on page 28 of &quot;book 2&quot; (section) is really the MIDLAND  THEATER, Kansas City, MO.  The accuracy of these and other details can be  verified by the Theatre Historical Soc. of America in Elmhurst, IL.  Especially for would-be architects, this will take one into a dreamland of  fantastic architecture which is now seeing some of the theatres pictured  herein restored to usefulness, and this volume will generate a longing for  the delightful aura of lavish (and not so lavish) movie palaces and  theatres from the recent past.  Had color photos been available at that  time, this book would deserve 5 stars! This volume's worthy successor is  the title: &quot;BEST REMAINING SEATS: The Story of the Golden Age of the  Movie Palace&quot; (1961), or its later reprint edition: &quot;The Best  Remaining Seats: The Golden Age of the Movie Palace&quot;(1987), both  available here at Amazon.com. While not an architect's book per se, it is  the seminal historic work in the field and not to be missed.	1999-04-30

Edward Humes' account of the Pat  Dunn murder case, as well as the numerous other cases he discusses in the  book, is a testament to the fact that innocent people are routinely sent to  prison for crimes they did not commit. A common thread that seems to  permeate these cases is the single minded approach police investigators and  prosecutors embrace once they zero in on a suspect, much to the delight of  the real perpetrators. What I find most disturbing, though, is the  inability of the judges, district attorneys, and prosecutors to admit their  mistakes. When evidence emerges that perhaps they were wrong, they go out  of their way to discredit contradictory evidence, conceal statements and  facts that disprove their theories; and then they try to block appeals that  might bring their errors to public light. Unfortunately, many appeals laws  are written in such a manner that not only allow this type of behavior but  in some cases make it impossible to appeal a conviction even when proof of  misconduct surfaces. Other laws prohibit victims of wrongful convictions  from seeking compensation for the damage inflicted on their lives.<br />Edward  Humes account of the Pat Dunn murder case presents compelling and well  documented evidence of Pat Dunn's innocence. My only question about the  case concerns two telephone calls that could have made a significant  difference in the outcome of the trial. One call was supposedly made by the  victim a day after she was reported missing. The second call was made to an  estate attorney concerning power of attorney. In both cases, the exact date  of the calls were in question. Nowhere in the text did I see any mention of  an attempt to examine phone records that could have verified the dates of  the calls. The only explanation I can think of for this is that perhaps  there is no way to track local phone calls, if indeed they were local.<br />In  addition to the Pat Dunn case the book covers several other cases involving  many of the same judges and prosecutors, many of whom are still in power  today. The most heart wrenching of these stories has to be the cases  concerning child molestation rings, where families were torn apart and  lives ruined. When Edward Humes writes, in referring to the release of the  Kniffens and McCuans, that &quot;after fourteen years, four more  innocent people finally walked out of prison,&quot; there is no way any  words can adequately describe the pain and misery that these four people  and their families had to endure. However, there is a way that Edward  Humes words can make a difference. First, it is an almost certainty that  the Pat Dunn case will be retried (defense attorneys have already filed for  a new trial). Secondly, I hope that the people of Bakersfield will read the  book and oust the judges and prosecutors who still remain in their  positions. And finally, I hope that Jenny and Jane McCuan read this book  and finally find the courage to reconcile with their parents. <br />One final  note. For those who may be interested in reading reviews and commentary  about &quot;Mean Justice&quot; from some of the prosecutors and attorneys  mentioned in the book, check out the site &quot;[...]  You will find a wealth of additional material including pictures of some of  the people Edward Humes writes about. Also, another book worth looking into  is &quot;In Spite of Innocence,&quot; an account of 400 wrongfully  convicted people sentenced to either death or life in prison	1999-03-11

I found this account fascinating, however, I question the validity.  Some of the details don't seem to make sense.  For instance,  would the wife of the prison camp commander really help a prisoner.  Even if the escape took  place while the camp commander was away he would still be severly punished  (maybe even end up a prisoner himself).  Also, the author does not talk  about the inhuman/unspeakable brutality of these prison camps.  The British  soldiers who found the men and the doctors who cared for them - where are  their accounts or even medical records?  So while I found the book a  engrossing adventure I am sceptical of its truthfulness.	1999-03-06

He explains that cancer research fails because the &quot;cell lines&quot; used in research have been changed in the laboratory  so that they bear no resemblance to actual human cancer cells. Therefore,  good lab results fail on human trials most of the time, as is verified in  the medical journals weekly.<br />This should be required reading for every  medical researcher. But it would show up the medical brahmins as frauds,  and is therefore ignored.<br />The book also contains much other useful health  information.<br />I have diligently researched the cancer literature during  the past six years, and Dr. Dermer's courageous thesis rings absolutely  true. Real progress in curing cancer will never be made on the prevailing  orthodox path of research. Chemo and radiation are acknowledged destroyers  of the immune system. Gene therapy is no answer, either. Rebuilding the  immune system is the only sensible approach.	1999-03-04

This is not one of them.  The recommendations from other authors (on the book sleeve) seem like professional quid pro quo, as the same authors are given as references inside. The book fails for  several reasons.  First the author lacks the in depth knowledge of her  subject matter, and is frank about that.  The interviews all take place  decades after the events, they lack  the kinds of vivid details that make  other books great. The biggest problem with the book is that it reads more  like a fictional account.  The witnesses present us with unverified first  hand accounts.  They are free to withhold more revealing details, or to  embellish their accounts.  Several of the accounts just don't ring true,  and one gets the impression that a story is being told.  The author lacked  the resources/ incentive to provide a more researched book. It may be  entertaining, but it seems more like a work of fiction.	1999-02-17

I consider Lesslie Newbigin a bridge between the past and the future. He is a British Churchman (intended gender reference) with one foot in the traditional (particularist) understanding of Church and one foot extended  toward the future, but unsure of where to place that foot. He recognizes  some shortcomings of the past, when the Church has been weak or downright  wrong, offers solutions one on top of another and then, hedges on how to  relate to persons of other religions.    Often, he simply repackages in  new language traditional approaches to contemporary problems. These  approaches, at worse, are elitist and, at best naive. At one place, he  writes that the tradition only needs to be restated in new terms which  relate to the new experience of modern society (page 64).  The strength  of this book is found in his examples which offer practical approaches to  difficult situations and in discussion points for dialogue between  evangelists and social activists.    The weaknesses include the longing  for the past and its Christian primacy, his reluctance to celebrate the  leaven of feminism within the Church, and diversity within society. Between  the lines, I detect a person who would be at home with British elitist  sentiments and who would give uncritical allegiance to the monarchy. I  think he is a traditionalist trying to fine tune the Church without  transforming it.   A recurring theme is that Christianity is a way of  understanding the human story. The Bible and Christianity are tools for  comprehending the human situation. The Christian faith can bring meaning  and hope to both individuals and to society. He says that Christianity is a  lens for viewing life. He gives examples of telescopes and microscopes to  reinforce this idea. I prefer an example using night vision goggles. The  images do not need to be magnified, they just need to have more light shed  upon them. Night vision goggles magnify the existing light so that the  darkness can be penetratedand the situation enlightened. He writes that  the purpose of the Bible is, &quot;not to understand the text, but to  understand the world through the text&quot; (page 98). Actually, the  examples point to a belief that Christianity can be helpful in seeking a  deeper understanding of human existence. Newbigin believes that when we  live our lives in light of the Christian faith, we will invite  non-Christians to ask questions. He says that most of the great sermons in  the Acts of the Apostles are in response to questions. Our challenge then  is to live a life of faith that is meaningful and hopeful. This enriched  life will cause non-Christians to inquire about our lifestyle and we can  then witness to them by answering the questions for which they are seeking  answers. He writes that, &quot;the Christian points to Jesus as master-clue  in the common search of humanity for salvation, and invites others to  follow&quot;(page 158).  Newbigin claims that praise is the primary  purpose of the Church. Evangelism and social justice are secondary issues.  These two secondary issues, and also others, are the missions of the  Church, not its purpose. This seems to be a reflection of the Westminster   Catechism which states that the chief purpose of mortals is to know and  glorify God. Newbigin has a good insight here and it can be helpful in  bridging the gap between practitioners of evangelism and social justice.   Newbigin knows that the Church does not have as much authority as it has  had previously. He laments this and says that in any learning situation the  teacher must have authority in order to teach. I do not necessarily accept  this claim. I feel that a teacher needs no external power of authority if  he or she is qualified and has something worthwhile to teach. Authority is  of little use unless you know what you are talking about and the lesson is  meaningful to the listener. When your message is meaningful, knowledgeable,  and interesting, you do not need anyadditional authority.  Another  theme is the concept of facts, values, and truth. These are verified by our  plausibility structures. The differences in what is fact, value or truth is  based on which theory we use to observe them. All theories such as science,  religion, or the social sciences all have their particular dogmas that  determine what is real, true, or plausible. Concerning Christianity he  writes, &quot;The Church thus does not claim to possess absolute truth: it  claims to know where to point for guidance (both in thought and in action)  for the common search for truth.&quot; (page 163).  How important is  absolute truth? I find that in my personal everyday life that there is  little if any need to be concerned with absolute truth; it has no more  significance to me than absolute zero temperature. There are very few  absolutes in the lives of ordinary persons. We live our lives in a  pluralistic community  which makes just about everything relative. Maybe  what Newbigin is longing for is homogeneity in a heterogeneous world.	1999-02-04

His writing is clear, his sources  verified and impeccable.  Rodney early on revealed October Surprise and in  his role as confidant to many to open the public to the misdirected efforts  of intelligence, he has tracked the CIA/DRUGS operations to their present  theaters.  Nothing missing.  Included is organized crime, money laundering,  and a great deal of intrigue. The writings had particular meaning for me --   Rodney wrote of Operation Mount Rushmore which was partially funded by a  resident of my own county, according to his sources.  Operation Mount  Rushmore was a plan involving CIA personnel to eliminate Bill Clinton when  he ran for the Presidency in July, 1992 -- a plan that had to be scrubbed  due to internal leaks.  Rodney found confirmation of the plan from  independent sources.  Upon reading that funding for Operation Mount  Rushmore  was coming from a Napa County source, I noted that the referenced  Gene Trefethen who owned a winery in Napa, had been Henry J. Kaiser's  &quot;right-hand-man&quot; for years, the builder of the  war industrial  behemoth known as Kaiser Industries ... a government funded giant in  ship-building which cranked out liberty ships to lend-lease to England,  with more to support the U.S. effort during World War II. Following the  wars, Kaiser turned its operations to the provision of health care, to  become the largest private provider of health care in California.  It's  lucrative, and Clinton's plan for health care reform threatened to take  Kaiser down.  Clearly, Gene Trefethen had intelligence associations for  years, and his substantial vesting in Kaiser would have provided motive for  the financing of a murder attempt.   Many local press articles hailed him  as one of George Bush's most significant fund raisers in California. When  he passedaway in 1997, he was eulogized by George Bush and California  Governor Pete Wilson, among others.  As recently as December, 1998, a woman  who occupied the guest cottage on the Trefethen  estate with her two  children was bludgeoned in a baffling assault.  Was this a random assault,  or a warning? Rodney's book is one that many can further validate from  their own associations, experience, and knowledge.  I highly recommend it  for its explanations of many realities most dare not address, and answers  to questions that have been &quot;out there&quot; for years.	1999-01-28

Although I am no longer a  member of his organization, the strategies in this book changed my life for  ever!  In 1991, the extent of my financial savy was a savings account  paying 5% and I thought the stock market was definately not for me, but for  the &quot;rich people&quot;. I read the book, followed the plans and  verified anything that sounded too good to be true with IRS publications  (again, his advice).   Now, a family man at the ripe old age of 32, I have  4 mutual funds, 8 stocks, a SEP-IRA and a 401K account. I thumb my nose at  15% returns, own 2 home based business and am so well positioned for  retirement that I shocked my family &amp; friends who thought I was going  to end up in jail if I followed his plans.  I've read a lot of similiar  books and heard the same advice from many sources.  I can tell you that  this book works, and it works for everyone.  I especially consider it to be  &quot;must read&quot; material for people in their teens and early 20's who  need to start off on the right foot.<br />As far as his Organization went...  after I used the resources to build my financial foundation, I felt as if  other plans they &quot;encouraged&quot; me to buy were just gimmicks for  getting more membership dues out of me.

No number of smiling photos in the  outback, or wistful stories of childhood in Bondi will disguise the  underlying fact that he is still stung by 60's Australian society, and  apparently believes that little has changed here since that time.<br />The  timely revelation of decades of abuse against indigenous Australians was  skillfully and appropriately composed, but much of the rest of the book is  grossly self indulgant	1999-01-12

Claims made by this biographer do not make it the truth. What you are  reading here are only the   allegations made by Spoto stated as  &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;words&quot; or &quot;heresay&quot; by persons  bitter toward MM's memory who did not REALLY know her well OR AT ALL. Info  that would have been enlightening &amp; truthful, was PURPOSELY deleted  from this book. This was an obvious effort to discredit other authors as  well as Robert Slatzer &amp; the tireless efforts he has made to bring the  truth of Marilyn's life and death to light. Persons who knew her well know  that she was a delightful, creative, loving &amp; generous person who had  the unfortunate habit of surrounding herself with a lot of people who only  used her to make money or for their own personal reasons. Misinformation   Spoto put in his book included, lying about Bebe Goddard (She's misquoted),  Doc Goddard (Doc did not molest Norma Jeane), Gladys Baker (hearsay tales  do not make a woman a tramp) &amp; others. Spoto also claims MM had  appointment with Mama Jean Bellos, Jean Harlow's mom, but alas Donald, she  died years before. This information could have easily been verified by  Spoto had he even bothered to check Jean Bellos's death certificate, &amp;  is also found in libraries &amp; in Bio's on Jean Harlow! According to Pat  Newcomb, she in fact, WAS NOT A CLOSE FRIEND OF MM. She WAS an  EMPLOYEE/FRIEND who did spend time with MM but WAS NOT A CLOSE  'CONFIDANTE'of Marilyn's. Evelyn Moriarity's relationship with MM is  overstated. Spoto Was in fact sued by Tony Summers &amp; others for libel.  Why bother with rehashed material, gossip &amp; lies. This author attempted  to Put RFK on a pedestal where he does not belong. The  discrediting of  others including MM makes for poor reading material &amp; a terrible waste  of young minds. This tome was about total self-gratification &amp; only  serves to glorify the author &amp; his so-called &quot;followers&quot;.  Read Donald Wolfe's, &quot;The Last Days Of Marilyn Monroe&quot;, or  &quot;Goddess&quot;, if you can't find a copy of the Robert Slatzer effort;  &quot;The Life &amp; Curious Death Of Marilyn Monroe&quot;, published in  1974.   Publisher's were more cautious about what they printed back then  &amp; authors wrote about their subjects &amp; did not rely on the trashing  of other authors or the loved ones, or relatives of their subject. Spoto   included persons as so-called &quot;authorities&quot; on this subject who  pacified his own needs and provided him with this concoction of  misinformation.  Shame on you Donald Spoto for what you did to MM's memory  &amp; the memory of her mother, foster sister, real friends and loved ones.   Donald Spoto has shown total disrespect for his subject and the memories  of those who cared and still care about Norma Jeane Mortenson, aka, The  Late Marilyn Monroe.

However, the strength of the coverage on folklore made the reading experience less painful.  What I hated about the book was that there information on the TV  show was WAY off base.  The author said that vampires on the TV show can  fly.  I could not believe that an author for a Buffy book would come to  that conclusion.  The vampires on Buffy can't fly!!!  I even verified this  fact with an insider to the show.  The author also said that Angel's soul  may not be his own.  Well, who's soul would it be if it wasn't his own.  I  found other Buffy errors in this book too.  Much of the book, however,  dealt with the folklore behind the various creatures on the show.  This  aspect of the book was good although some of it was pretty dry reading.  The book was basically one big episode guide.  Any extra information was  presented as sidebars.  The quizzes in the book were pretty bad too.  For  the most part, the questions did not pertain to the content of the show.  An example of this is a question that asks which of four songs does not  pertain to vampires or which of four movies do not pertain to vampires (the  songs and movies are not even connected to Buffy except that they are about  vampires).  If you want a good quiz for Buffy fans, check out the book  entitled &quot;Bite Me : Sarah Michelle Gellar and Buffy the Vampire  Slayer.&quot;  If you want a book that will give you the best insight on  the show (and itself includes folklore) check out &quot;The Watcher's  Guide&quot; by Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder.

Unfortunately, their section on Aiki-jujitsu and Aikido has some serious errors.  First, they claim that  Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido was the only legitimate heir of the Daito  Ryu school of aiki-jujitsu.  This is incorrect.  Tokumine Takeda, son of  Sokaku Takeda (Ueshiba's Daito Ryu teacher for over a decade), was the heir  of Daito Ryu.  The current headmaster is Katsuyuki Kondo.  There are also  several other branches of Daito Ryu: Kodokai, Roppokai, and Takumakai,  which were started by students of Takeda Sokaku who were actually senior to  Ueshiba.  Ratti and Westbrooke also stated that Daito Ryu no longer exists,  and that we have no way of knowing today the techniques of the the Daito  Ryu.  Again, untrue. Daito Ryu is one of the most widely practiced  traditional styles of martial arts (Koryu Budo) in Japan.  Finally, they  state with some authority that Daito Ryu descended from Prince Sadasumi.  This cannot be verified, even by Daito Ryu practitioners.  Like many oral  tales, it is a history that people accept in the absence of confirming or  contradicting evidence.<br />What is disturbing is that after twenty years,  this information was never updated.  Perhaps this was because Ratti and  Westbrook did not use any original source, i.e. Japanese, material (at  least I did not see any when I glanced through the glossary).  Perhaps it  was because they felt some need to promote aikido at the expense of Daito  Ryu.  It does not matter, really.  Writing a traditional Japanese martial  art out of any book that purports describe the history of Japanese martial  arts is a gaffe that makes me wonder what else about the book they have  gotten wrong.<br />I give the book three stars for effort, but let the buyer  beware.  When reading, don't believe anything until you verify, verify,  verify.	1999-01-01

But, by  using the references given in the footnotes, both for and against the  argument, I verified (as can anyone else) that the evidence is presented  fairly.  This book is very dense and it will take perseverance to follow  the argument from beginning to end.  However, it is very well divided into  individual criticisms which do not depend on the answers given in other  areas.  I recommend this book highly to everyone who is willing to spend  time and thought searching for the truth.  A less comprehensive, and  perhaps more readable, book covering much of the same material is The Case  for Christ by Lee Strobel.	1998-12-14

While this true-life story can't compete with the constant thrill-a-minute excitement level of a fictional Tom Clancy novel, the wonderful realities and historical remembrances portrayed here provide a down-to-earth  documentation well worth a few hours of your time.  The editor provides a  unique and historically accurate documentary of the little-known life of  her great-grand-mother, Rachel Kerr, mostly from her great-grand-mother's  own hand.  Rachel was a young farm-girl who married a minister and spent  much of her life as a missionary's wife in India in the mid-1800's, far  from the family she loved so much.   The editor initially provides  informative and interesting historical background material about Rachel's  youth while growing up in and around Hookstown, Pennsylvania.  Hookstown is  a very small cross-roads town located in hilly farm-country about 30 miles  west of Pittsburgh near the state border with West Virginia. The details of  her life in this area can be easily verified through numerous government  and individual archive records available today.  Even many of the physical  locations in and around Hookstown can still be easily traced and located  today.  Hookstown has now grown a little bit and is an interesting place to  visit; but it still remains an out-of-the-way place which doesn't put much  stock in trying to keep up with the hectic pace of the rest of the world.   After the background has been properly set, the editor then smoothly brings  in the real meat of the story through incorporation of an extensive  verbatim  series of letters written personally by Rachel, coupled with  historical commentary where needed.  These original letters provide an  unusual personal and emotional insight into Rachel's exciting but  challenging life as a mother and as a missionary's wife in the extremely  dangerous and difficult environment of mid-eighteenth century India.  The  brief story of how the editor encountered her great-grand-mother's letters  is itself a fascinating one.   The stories these letters tell bring a  real-life perspective to us that the movies have never touched.  I became  particularly attached to the book when I found out that the subject is my  great-great aunt, that all the people she describes are my relatives, and  that I grew up in her hometown locale.  I also have a large, beautiful  cross-stitch done by Rachel Kerr in 1848 at the age of 12.  I always  cherished that cross-stitch, even as a little boy, but, until I read this  book, I only knew that Rachel Kerr was somehow related to me.  I found the  same beauty and sensitivity in this book that I always admired in that  cross-stitch and it confirms to me  what a wonderfully bright, talented,  and unique person this lady truly was.

The authors basic eating principle is &quot;to stay alive, eat live foods.&quot;  To die a slow and painful death, eat dead foods.  I find it very hard to argue with this principle.<br />My real reason  for writing this review is to take a poke back at the nay-sayers and people  who didn't like this book.<br />&quot;They don't have any credentials&quot; -  both Marilyn and Harvey are graduates of the American College of Health  Sciences.  Granted the college is not &quot;accredited&quot;.  But  accredited by whom?  The drug-establishment, of course.<br />&quot;Protein  doesn't leach calcium...&quot; - multiple studies have been done and  written up in the Lancet, New England Journal of medicine, etc. all CITED  by the authors in their second book, Fit for Life II.  Articles that can be  EASILY found and verified.  Excessive amounts of protein in the diet DOES  in fact cause calcium leaching.  The eskimos of northern Canada are prime  examples.  By the ages of 35-38, most child bearing women are hunched over  from osteoporosis because of their diets and multiple children.<br />The  beauty of the &quot;program&quot; is that it ISN'T a program.  It teaches  us to respect our bodies, that our bodies can't TAKE 17 different foods at  once (a typical thanksgiving dinner) and expect to get much out of it.   Granted most of America is alive, but it also happens to be the MOST  drugged nation in the world.  Like the authors said, it isn't a  coincidence, that the number 1 non-prescription drug 3 years running is an  Ant-acid for heartburn.  Imagine if EVERYONE tried fit for life?  Where  would those pharmaceutical companies make their profits?<br />&quot;We're  still alive at 80, and not food combining.&quot;  There are different  levels of ALIVE at 80.  Most 3rd world cultures do not have the luxury of  having more than one or two foods at their dinner tables come supper time.   They've been food combining for ages without knowing it.  It's only been in  our western society, with our western afflictions and ways of curing them  (how about a spoon full of mustard gas for that colon cancer?) that we've  been running into the problems of affluency.<br />Moderation is indeed the  key.  The Diamonds have been able to divulge the reasons why in fact  moderation is the key to a long happy, and pain free life.	1998-12-05

It is an accurate description of the current state of the Roman Catholic Church -- Protestantized and overrun by secular  humanists, it has no identity with anything in its history before  1965.<br />While the reasons for this change can be construed as belonging  solely to the realm of fiction, many of the events are allusions to events  that have really occurred and can be verified with a little effort (e.g.,  certain ritualistic slayings of priests in the midwest).  The motivations  and attitutes of the principle hierarchical protagonists are nothing short  of fact especially for those of us who at one time lived under the watchful  eye of the &quot;Cardinal of Century City&quot; in a diocese which used to  be one of the largest, most Catholic areas of the country (anyone can  figure out which deceased U.S. Cardinal he represents with some little  effort) whose orchestrations and two-faced dealings are only beginning to  come to light today, but are quickly buried by the NCCB.<br />If you're  confused why the Church has changed so much, how it can go from the Church  of Christ which concentrated on pleasing the Lord above all, to one of the  main proponents of Masonic secular humanism which concentrates only on  pleasing man and catering to his (or her) social whims in only 30 or so  years, this is one not-so-pleasant theory.  How much is true, I am afraid  to guess, but I will say this book accurately reflects the current  condition of the Roman Catholic Church in an artistic manner.	1998-12-02

The book reveals how the U S Government let its men down and left the crew of the  Pueblo out there without any help or so-called back-up plan. It reveals  just how isolated and ignorant the North Korean Communists were, and  probably still are. The book is very well written and it is hard to put  down. It shows just how brutal a people can be, and how a good sense of  humor can get you through it. Bucher's vivid descriptions have been  verified by members of the crew. It also shows how terribly the U S  Government turned its back on the crewmembers by not issuing the men any  POW medals as we were &quot;technically not at war with the North  Koreans.&quot; (They were issued medals 20 years later.) Probably the best  book on the subject, and has several humorous places which makes it fun to  read as well. Highly recommended for scholars of Naval History and  Psychology.  The fact remains that all but one crewmember came back alive,  which Commander Bucher was given little or no credit, except from John H.  Chaffee, then Sect'y of the Navy who said &quot;These men have suffered  enough.&quot; when refering to a court martial and board of inquiry. The  book makes one think twice about how big people in high places are watching  out for themselves and not the commands they are supposed to be in charge  of. Reading the book does not reveal any bitterness from the author or his  crew, but a sincerely deep sense of terrible disappointment of its  superiors all the way up the chain of command. A real eye-opener!	1998-11-21

The book verified  what I have long believed...that we travel from one life to another with  &quot;soulmates&quot; and ultimately make contact with those individuals in  one form or another.  How many of us have met an individual for the first  time, only to instantly connect with that person as if we'd known them  forever!  Dr. Weiss's experiences with his patients prove that love is  real, and once you find that very special person, you connect with them in  a way that even death cannot take away. The book sent chills through me as  I read experiences similar to what has occurred in my own life with one  special individual. What a thrill it must be to sit through a regression  session with Dr. Weiss!  Since reading &quot;Only Love is Real&quot;, I've  read all his other books, and eagerly await the next!	1998-09-14

It may also have destroyed my life, for it turned out to be the first  paving stone on a spiritual path which lead away from much of what was  accepted and familiar. The path brought me to most of what I treasure  today.<br /> I was a thoroughly Western, rational, mechanist,  Ayn-Rand-Objectivist, John-Wayne-style &quot;I'll do it myself&quot;  individualist whose life was thoroughly unsatisfying. Each day I came home  from a thankless, stressful job to a cold and chaotic home. I would sit on  the couch a feel as though worries and disappointments were rushing about  in my mind like a bunch of cats and dogs, chasing and screaming with no  pause to even start on a resolution.<br /> I remembered having heard about a  book called The Relaxation Response. All I knew was the title and that it  was written by a &quot;legitimate scientist.&quot; For a couple bucks, it  seemed like a safe bet. Since it was written by a Harvard doctor, I could  read it without admitting there was anything wrong with my modern, secular  worldview.<br /> The detailed description of his experimental methods, the  charts, graphs and citations gave me comfort as I read about techniques  brought to the West by gurus and swamis. Dr. Benson verified the  physiological changes brought about by meditation and Christian prayer,  then cut away the mythology, dogma, and ritual. The process which remained  is simple enough to fit on two pages of the book.<br /> I followed the  instructions. I felt some peace. I repeated the process. The peace  expanded. I added headphones playing the sounds of waves on a beach. Calm  and clarity began to enter my daily life. I was able to be transported by  music. I enjoyed a walk in the woods.<br /> I still lost my job. My wife still  left me. I still got sad.<br /> I added yoga and spirituality to my life. I  opened myself to a wider spectrum of experience. My courage increased.<br /> I  kept on with my life. I made changes. I remarried and had children. I  succeeded in a new career.  I expanded and deepened my social contacts.  Everything I lost seems only to have cleared the way for a better life.<br />  I highly recommend The Relaxation Response for anyone looking for a  Western, scientific bridge to eastern wisdom. I do note, that in the years  since learning The Relaxation Response and teaching it to others, I have  noticed that I am unusual in having learned it from a book. Most people  need a teacher and a group to get the effect. The scientific detail in the  book may nevertheless be what it takes to make you feel safe about taking a  meditation class.on with my life.

He produced a series of books  published before 1950 surveying the red light districts, criminal haunts,  and notorious incidents occurring in Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans  and elsewhere. In those days, before the public fascination with true-crime  resulted in a flood of new books rushed into print, Asbury had the field  pretty much to himself. Gem of the Prairie remained out of print for many  years, but it inspired generations of Chicago writers to produce more of  the same; Herman Kogan, Finis Farr, Lloyd Wendt, Bill Helmer, Henry Justin  Smith, Emmett Dedmon, Curt Johnson, (and myself, I must confess), to name  but a few. Asbury blazed new trails for all of us, but his research is  largely based on newspaper accounts and poorly documented second-hand  sources. Many of the anecdotes, though engrossing, cannot be verified upon  further research. Mr. Asbury colors the text with florid  prose,unintentional wit, and a withering cynicism common to the Chicago  school of writing, but he fails to provide the reader with synthesis of his  subject matter. Stories are evenly told, but we are left to ponder the  obvious question. Did the same economic and social forces that fueled  Chicago's phenomonal growth in the late 19th Century also contribute to the  reputation the Windy City is still enjoys as a wide-open, corrupt town  where anything goes? The answers are to be found elsewhere.	1998-08-23

Garwood was NEVER properly debriefed, any information he  has disclosed has been the subject of attacks from our two \\"Hanoi John\\"  senators and their DOD lackeys (such as reviewer w4hh@3wave.com) whose  intent is to to kill the PoW/MIA issue through the spread of  disinformation, lies, threats, and cover-ups of a magnitude never before  seen in this country (with the exception of the JFK assassination).

Dan Sherman's 'Above Black: Project Preserve Destiny' is one of the most compelling UFO books I have read. Told in a straight, matter of fact tone, Sherman recounts his recruitment and training by the Air Force to communicate 'intuitively' with an alien species. According to Sherman his story begins in the early 60's with the abduction of his mother and his own subsequent genetic manipulation to foster is unique communication abilities. Subsequent to his entry into the Air Force, Sherman eventually is recruited into AF Intelligence. While stationed at the National Security Agency to attend an electronic warfare course, Sherman is also trained secretly to invoke his 'Intuitive Communicator' (IC) abilities and understand the associated protocols. Following his training, the book on one level recounts his AF postings, his communications with aliens and the knowledge they impair. On another, the book documents his increasing ill ease and frustration of being part a sinister!  Government program that lies to its people about an impending Armageddon and it's complicity in the abduction of citizens it's worn to protect. As a UFO investigator of sorts, I have checked many of Sherman's claims and have verified the veracity of each one.

In the first remembered &quot;incarnation&quot; related in this book, the patient finds herself in a past life and identifies the year as 1863 B.C. Uh, exactly how could someone living in that year identify it as &quot;B.C.&quot;? Weiss doesn't ask; I hope readers do. In fact, Weiss is constantly amazed by &quot;specifics&quot; that are vague (ask yourself how often Catherine is able to pinpoint a location or an event in such a way that it could be verified; answer: never), &quot;truths&quot; that are commonplace, and &quot;knowledge&quot; that has no foundation except that Catherine says it. Repeatedly he refers to words like &quot;proofs&quot; and &quot;scientific&quot; without--even once--providing an example of anything approaching scientific inquiry. The point is not that science is the arbiter of all truth; the point is that Weiss himself calls science as a witness--and then doesn't ask it any questions. He relies on the adjective &quot;scientific&quot; to carry his argument, just as he relies on the word &quot;proof.&quot; There are indeed great spiritual truths, but they are not so easily won as this. There are other and better ways to discover that faith, hope, and love are the essence of life, which is all that Weiss finds out. Gee, amazing.	1998-05-04

I first read this text back in the early '90's and  believed it to be incredibly incisive and perceptive.  It seemed to illuminate problems before they existed for me!  I felt I had an 'inside edge' on the other guys.  However, as time went on, I began to realize that the text espouses placing my proverbial fingers in the holes of our crackling dam.  I now use the book as a starting place on designing logical test cases.  However, that is where the book stops.  See, in producing software for the government, there are these things known as REQUIREMENTS which must be verified and validated via inspections and a traceability matrix, respectively.  I suppose this situation is also prevalent in corporations who wish to sell software to the burgeoning EU, Japan, and Australia.  With standards such as ISO 9000.3 and the CMM becoming more and more important, I would like to see Mr. Kaner et. al. attempt to incorporate these standards (which are ensconced in Quality control) into their up coming revision. Who knows?  Maybe it is possible to actually perform great testing in both the logical-based and requirements-based arenas?	1998-04-02
US	53006074	RQBQEYP19KHW0	0553278274	957420140	A Night to Remember	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Stunning over view of a tragic event...	Walter Lord's &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; is the first full text on the subject of the Titanic that I've ever read.  I must say that for a first reference, it was spellbinding and literally I could not put this book down until I finished it.  Mr. Lord's detailed narrative allows the reader to feel that the he or she is actually on that ill fated ship.  The description of the events are so vivid that one can clearly picture the demise of the grand vessel.  What is most striking to me is the apparent authenticity of the data that was known at the time of the writing of this volume.  Mr. Lord writes clearly and from a standpoint of firmness which lends an incredible air of authenticity.  Gladly missing from this work are the mindless theories that permeate throughout a majority of Titanic literature.  Just a factual and as comprehensive, as much as the data can be verified, treatise on what actually happened on that terrible April night in 1912.   Of note in this work are the whereabouts and status of the other ships in the area.  Most references that I've read mention very little of the California and Carpathia just after the first distress messages were sent.  Mr. Lord provides greater insight as to what these ships were doing and their eventual actions by their captains.  The descriptions and actions of the principle players were mentioned in greater detail than in other references.  Captain Smith was described as active by Mr. Lord which is probably the demeanor that should have been assumed by the captain of a ship rather than the passive, bewildered automaton mentioned in other works.  Other persons were alluded to also that have failed to be mentioned in other works.  These people, famous and not so famous, all made up the crew and passengers of the Titanic.  What they did and said during this tragic event speaks greatly of the human penchant for survival, sacrifice, bravery, stupidity and what Mr. Lord has aptly demonstrated is that this was a human tragedyof monumental proportions.  Mr. Lord has also captured the mind set of the people of that time.  People did think differently back then as was interestingly described when a third cabin passenger broke an item belonging to the ship, which in turn belonged to the White Star Line, and was threatened with possible arrest from one of the stewards when they would eventually get to New York City.  How amazing this is in light of the situation at hand.  What were people thinking?  And what were some of the crew thinking when they would not allow some of the third cabin passengers onto the upper decks?  Most chilling is the mentioning, in the forward, of Morgan Robertson's fictional 1898 tale of a similarly fated vessel.  A profound prologue for this subject and a bit hair-raising to know that so many features mentioned in his the story were part of the real story.  This is a must reading for all those concerned with the subject of  the Titanic.  If a first book on the subject should be read, this is it.	1998-04-01
US	52925878	R2TIB3KU9HSX0J	0679755829	7056089	Remembering Satan:  A Tragic Case of Recovered Memory	Books	4	51	56	N	N	A fascinating and frustrating case of alleged satanic abuse	&quot;Remembering Satan&quot; is an account of one of the more prominent and tragic cases of alleged child abuse and satanic ritual abuse (SRA).  Author Lawrence Wright makes it clear that he does not believe the majority of the allegations, and how could he?  What started as &quot;mere&quot; allegations of sexual abuse soon developed into allegations of a widespread satanic cult that included many members of the investigating police force, lawyers, judges, and many others.<br />The allegations started when Ericka and Julie Ingram accused their father, Paul Ingram, of molesting them.  Paul Ingram was a deputy sheriff and deeply religious man in Olympia, Washington.  He soon admitted to the allegations and began naming others as participants in all manner of rapes, orgies, and satanic rituals.  The problem with the case, though, was that the allegations kept growing.  Soon the alleged participants were talking about photographs, sacrifices of animals and human babies, and much more--none of which could be verified by any physical evidence.  Further, the stories were often contradictory or patently false.<br />Wright attempts to combine in a relatively slim volume the successful prosecution of Paul Ingram (who confessed), the destruction of a family and the lives of many others, and the hysteria surrounding the search for satanic cults.  He locates these events within the larger context of repressed memories and the television talk-show dominated landscape of 1980s' America.  There are problems in this approach as the subject matter seems to be one that cannot be captured in the book's approximately 200 pages, but Wright does an extraordinary job in presenting the material he has chosen to include.<br />For those who have trouble crediting the outlandish claims of those who advocate widespread SRA, this book should be a fascinating read.  For those who find themselves on the other side of the fence and believe fully in the validity of repressed memories, &quot;Remembering Satan&quot; will probably seem to be a slap in the face or just another part of the conspiracy.  Either way, the Ingram case itself, which is the focus of this book, is a fascinating study in a modern-day witch hunt and the credulity of the investigators--and the accused.	1998-02-12

His discussion of COBE and other recent developments in astronomy is insightful. However, I can't recommend this book on that basis alone. His primary thesis is that the discoveries of modern science reveal not just any God or any Creator, but the God of the Bible in particular.<br /> Rossargues that many parameters of the Universe are fine-tuned to support life, but many of his claims are simply false. For example, it is not true that if the electromagnetic coupling constant were just a little smaller, electrons would not bind to atoms.  Ross's claim that life couldn't exist if the lifetime of the proton were significantly different from 10^32 years requires knowledge far beyond what we currently have, such as a well-established and experimentally verified theory of proton decay. Most of the quotations that Ross cites asserting the fine-tuning of the universe are philosophical speculations or personal interpretations of the data.  One should not take seriously any claim that science has proven the existence of any Creator (let alone the God of the Bible) until someone publishes in mainstream peer-reviewed scientific publications (e.g.. the Physical Review journals) a paper specifically concluding the existence of the Creator.  The paper would analyze the data carefully and show that the author has not made any unwarranted assumption, and has considered alternative possibilities.<br />   Ross's discussion of quantum gravity and the odds of life forming (which parallels discredited Creationist arguments) indicates that he does not really understand them.  His interpretation of Biblical quotes is simply pathological.  It is beyond me how anyone can assert with a straight face that &quot;In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth&quot; and &quot;By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command so that what is seen was not made outof what was visible&quot; refers to God being outside our own experience of three spacial dimensions and one time dimension.  Ross's claim reminds me of Woody Allen's parody of prophecy, &quot;Two nations will go to war, but only one will win.&quot;	1998-01-18

This series strikes me as one long, elaborate, multi-layered metaphor for surviving childhood trauma.  Over and over we see the boy-become-man  returning to a moment of horror in the past, sometimes literally reaching back, struggling to make things turn out differently.  Roland's world as seen in the books is a degraded version not only of our \\"real\\" world but also of the sheltered and ordered world he remembers from his youth.  Something has happened to make it turn nightmare: a clergyman in black robes pushes a boy in front of a car; the boy hides from a threatening adult in the desert way-station.... Roland watches the fear repeat itself in many forms.  After confronting his memories, Roland complains that he's \\"going insane an inch at a time, trying to live with two versions of reality.\\"  This could be a clinical study of a post-traumatic stress patient.  We all know of King's preoccupation with demonic cars and trains, and the incident in his childhood that precipitated it, but a King aficionado tells me that, in each of King's horror novels, there's also a scene in which someone takes revenge on an adult for something he or she suffered as a child.  I've only verified it in one book, \\"The Tommyknockers.\\"  I haven't given the books the highest rating  because they are over-long and a bit talky at times. This is especially painful because their subject matter is so distasteful--just like the memories that Roland must face or die.  Also, I've actually spotted a few malapropisms that really distressed me, coming from a writer as prolific and popular as King.	1997-11-11

As a practicing scientist who follows this field, my impression is that the majority of the published work in this area falls into one of three categories:  Critiquing existing methodologies, improving on existing methodologies, and less frequently, proposing a new methodology that is felt to have solved the philosophical problems of the previous methods.  Dr. Mayo's book falls into the third category.<br /><br /> In the last half of this century, the debate in this field has centered around the &quot;Falsification&quot; methodology of Karl Popper.  In testing deterministic hypotheses, Popper observed that hypotheses can be proven wrong with falsifying evidence by applying the logical rule of modus tollens.  However, when experimental evidence is consistent with the hypothesis, believing that this confirms the hypothesis is committing the &quot;affirming the consequent&quot; fallacy.  Hence, scientific &quot;theories&quot; cannot be verified, but only falsified.  Subsequent philosophers pointed out a number of shortcomings with this method: it cannot be applied to statistical hypotheses (which is the area were methodology is most important to practicing scientists), the Duhem problem- an observation can only falsify a hypothesis if it is conclusively certain, and the problem of auxiliary assumptions- when data is inconsistent with the hypothesis, the test is not informative regarding whether the main hypothesis is false or whether the problem resides in the ever-present auxiliary assumptions that are necessary to connect the hypothesis with experimental implications.<br /><br />  Subsequent philosophers addressed these methodological faults by  applying the principles of Bayesian statistics to the problem of testing hypotheses; using experimental evidence to transform an a priori probability of a hypothesis being valid to an a posteriori probability.  Ideas from a number of Bayesian philosophers were synthesized by Howson and Urbach in their excellent book, Scientific Reasoning: The Bayesian Approach.  This method  applies equally well to both statistical and deterministic hypotheses.  Also, the Bayesians claim neat solutions to other problems with Popper, e.g., auxiliary assumptions and Duhem.  Predictably, other philosophers were quick to find faults with this approach.  The most common objections are: the necessity of subjective prior probabilities and the &quot;Problem of Old Evidence.&quot;<br /><br />  Mayo, in her book Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge, presents an Error-Statistical approach to scientific inference.  She confronts head-on three important issues that any normative method must address: What counts as experimental evidence?, How to assess the acceptability of auxiliary assumptions and how to rule out alternative hypotheses?, and How to falsify statistical hypotheses?  The first is addressed by explicitly identifying and justifying assumptions of the experimental data.  The second issue is handled by the careful design and control of experiments.  Statistical hypotheses are falsified using Neyman-Pearson type statistical tests.<br /><br />  The concept of &quot;severe tests&quot; is developed which is very powerful and widely applicable.  Experiments are designed to ensure that the test of a hypothesis is severe and informative.  These tests are useful in both testing auxiliary hypotheses and ruling out alternate hypotheses.  A hypothesis can be confirmed if it passes a severe test (enabling the &quot;Growth of Knowledge.&quot;)  Mayo effectively uses the concept of severe tests to shed light on the philosophical problem of the acceptability of ad hoc (use-constructed) hypotheses. Common or canonical types of error are assembled into an &quot;error repertoire&quot; which are used to design experiments.  When hypotheses  fail,  these well design tests will yield information as to which type of error was committed. Failed hypotheses are subsequently improved by applying the Peircean idea of  &quot;listening to error patterns.&quot;<br /><br />  Deterministic hypotheses are brought into this framework by the observation that in testing such hypotheses, inevitable approximations, inaccuracies and uncertainties enable the application of standard statistical tests.  Also, Mayo's Error Statistical approach seems to address many of the other shortcomings of both Popper and the Bayesians.  Perhaps the most important aspect of Mayo's methodology to practitioners as myself, is that these principles are of practical use to scientists, as opposed to merely impressive theoretical constructs.  Her statement &quot;you cannot just throw some evidence at the error-statistician and expect an informative answer&quot; rings true to any scientist that has tried to draw conclusions from poorly designed experiments.  I can strongly recommend this book to practitioners of both the &quot;hard&quot; sciences and certainly the &quot;soft&quot; sciences where methodology is of critical importance.<br /><br /> D.S.

The only reason I would classify this book as a 9 and not a 10 is due to the lack of verifiable confirmation by other authorities.      Colonel Phillip J. Corso can be verified as being an aide to President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the internet.  The only difference being the spelling of the first name Phillip vs Philip.      If Col. Corso is the legitimate author and has not made up a work of fiction by interweaving fact and fiction, then this is probably the most heroic thing that an individual could do.       I would consider Col. Corso a great patriot that will almost certainly give the US Government back to the people.  The USA citizens should not tolerate a secret government.  Even if was necessary to protect the citizens until an answer was understood, Colonel Corso indicates that the alien threat is at least blunted.  He even intimates that the world now has global protection and other world threats are at least under control and the world is protected.      If the book only had endorsements or reliable witness testimony then perhaps we can believe that the Roswell Incident did occur and aliens did crash land on our planet.

The whole notion of a `Judgement Day' is shown to be childish and merely a weapon, used by the Church throughout the centuries, to scare good people into believing as they do -  OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES! <br />In the second chapter, `THE SPIRIT WORLD', Monsignor speaks of the Spirit World proper, and, in effect, takes us on a `guided tour' of the countless beauties thatawait us all - free to enjoy, without condition. Mention is made of the architecture, and of the superbly beautiful materials that the buildings are composed; the private dwellings that dot the landscape, giving the impression of being one immense park-land, with no territorial boundaries. (overcrowding is unheard of, despite the  countless millions of inhabitants.) <br />One of the most surprising things to be read is the fact that churches, of all denominations, exist in the Spirit World. Monsignor explains, that, as the members of the congregation look around themselves, and see what they regard to be `Heaven' - brought about by their great faith - what better way to give thanks to God but to build a church to his glory? (and hope for his continued benevolence.) Monsignor explains, however, that those who live in this `home-made' Heaven are strictly confined to themselves, with no prospect of converting others, and that for as long as they stay within their constricted Heaven, so will their spiritual progression be at a standstill. <br />A large portion of the second chapter is devoted to the extremely important subject of gardens and the infinite variety of  flowers (with many types only to be found in the Spirit World.) Where there is no night-time, or seasons, it can be appreciated that all manner of flowering arrangements are to be had. We are told how colour produces sound, and how sound produces colour, and therefore how everything is arranged to produce consonance with its neighbour. <br />Spiritual progression is also touched upon. We are told how great personages from the high realms often come down and freely meet the inhabitants, bringing with them encouragement and unconditional love, direct from the Father of us all. <br />The third chapter, `SPIRIT PERSONALITY', deals with thought and how it is the `building-block' of life in Spirit.(Although not touched upon in great depth in this book, `Life in the World Unseen' has an example of an extension to alibrary being constructed entirely by thought, with no `hands-on' participation.) We are also told how the power of thought can transport us throughout the entire Spirit World, and how it is possible to communicate telepathically.   <br />Throughout  this book, it can be seen to be Monsignor's sole purpose to show us something of the brilliant prospect that lies before each of us when our moment comes to join the happy band of contented, NORMAL, people, who, FOR ALL TIME, are enjoying the reality of what we so readily think of as merely being the end result of a religious exercise - only for the `select few'; who, in reality, can have no notion of what life in the Spirit World is really like, for one simple reason - THEY ARE AFRAID TO ASK!!  <br />(128 pages, paperback)  <br />With great regret, `Life in the World Unseen' is currently out of print. (Concerning the U.K.) <br />However, a fourth book `Heaven and Earth' is available.                                                                       MARK NAFTEL	1996-08-20
