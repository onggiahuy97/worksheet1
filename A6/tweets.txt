@DmytroKuleba Excellent effort to support those in your country 👏  Well done UKRAINE for challenging the racism and providing support!  #StandWithUkraine️
"@EmmaKennedy @lb230 @RishiSunak What, a tax on record profits from the guy who created a covid load scheme so bad that £4.3 billion is stolen from taxpayers, and he refused help to try and recover it?  He's probably too busy answering questionnaires for breaking the law with #DowningStreetParties #PartyGate"
@paraicobrien Just watched the report on #C4News    Thank you for covering his subject. It's so sad that they face both the onslaught from Russia then racism as they try to seek refuge in another country.  How shameful of the authorities to allow this to happen.
@TomTugendhat EU and US have no delays.  The same people who were at #DowningStreetParties are once again showing failure to do the right thing.

"@PippaCrerar So Sunak creates a scheme resulting in billions in covid loans stolen, then writes off £4.3 billion of taxpayers money.  And he broke the law attending at least one of the many #DowningStreetParties ?"
@rachelparris @GaryNewman Johnson will do anything to distract us from him breaking the law with  #DowningStreetParties
"@PippaCrerar Much like Johnson with #DowningStreetParties   One wasn't enough, they had to break the law at a dozen or so 🤷‍♂️"
"@Jo_WhiteheadUK Billions paid out to shareholders through gas, water and electric, not to mention rail; millions in bonuses to exec management, but continued underinvestment; not to mention all the gov subsidies, shoddy services and pollution eg #rawsewage   The taxpayer is being robbed."
@GeorgeMonbiot Pity we didn’t bother to do it despite hosting #COP26
@PandaScottish @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson @cabinetofficeuk The greatest of respect for the Queen demonstrating leadership and sacrifice.  Zero respect for everyone partying while the rest of us were in lockdowns #DowningStreetParties
@Feargal_Sharkey @AndyEuropean @Ofwat The shame of dumping #RawSewage in our waterways.   Absolutely disgraceful.
@theGrit_music Haven’t watched it for that reason alone.   The Conservative party has morphed into a cesspit of populist #RawSewage at the expense of public safety and health.
@AnumSNP It doesn't and won't.  He's sacrificing public health for self preservation #DowningStreetParties
@OwenJones84 Our PM is sacrificing public health for self preservation by appeasing the extremists of his party  #DowningStreetParties

@StSenka Quite!  Though eventually poor decision making at government level will filter down into their lives and they’ll wonder why; the answer to which is a lack of interest in politics.  E.g. Still surprised how few care about #RawSewage in our waterways.
"@AlexTaylorNews @Shivajihimself They should have both said:   Biden, Putin and Macron averted war while Boris Johnson distracted people from #DowningStreetParties by ending free testing in the middle of a pandemic causing healthcare chaos."
"@trishgreenhalgh Disgraceful, dangerous and more people will die because of this.  Never thought we'd have such an irresponsible government in the UK.  It's one way to reduce talk on #DowningStreetParties"

@davidbewart #ScottyThePathologicalLiar said he was completely cleared by the “independent” inquiry. That’s the one in which the complainant played no part due to pending legal action.
@DarylTractor Is this the #LeMMMMMMRipRussell? The one who reckons there’s ‘nothing to see here’ with respect to long Covid and kids?
@saffronhowden This is a poor take on the current situation that confronts those losing respect for #auspol journalism. As a matter of fact it actually reinforces our frustrations
@WllmNewell We’re obviously travelling in parallel universes. I’m almost speechless 🤷🏻 Are you seriously contending that the ABC is not colouring what they are currently reporting re #auspol

@davidbewart So says the #PhantomPM
@noplaceforsheep Personally I applaud the Herald Sun’s unique style of reporting the facts. This predictable and ongoing strategy by the #MurdochSewageCompany may finally be having the opposite effect to what Rupert desires.

@Shellbran3 @IshatReza Exactly. Got to vote strategically Lib-NDP-Green. Suck it up &amp; vote strategically for the progressive Party that is in the best position to defeat Ford PC Conservatives. Just do it for a future Ontario: PUBLIC Healthcare; social programs &amp; services. 🥾#VoteFordOut #TogetherWeCan
@givepeazachance Yes🤢Conservative Premiers will bring in Privatized Healthcare. Unaffordable cost just to go to a Family Doctor. Exactly why we in Ontario Must turn out in huge numbers Jun 2 election to #VoteFordOut. Ford lifted #MaskMandate the day kids back to school after MarchBreak. MDs🗣😷
"@mmorden @PBethlenfalvy All of the Infectious Disease Doctors, plus Family Doctors have stated that everyone needs to still #WearAMask indoors because #COVID19 is rising.

"@IshatReza Moronic Health Minister @celliottability shows she cares ZERO about health/people. She’s just another Ford Puppet. Where’s Dr Kieran Moore? Very quiet &amp; invisible as #Ontario #COVID19 cases are about 30-35,000 DAILY (as per Dr Peter Juni-ON Science Advisory Table). #VoteFordOut"
@Mikeggibbs Who knows what’s true with Ontario Doug Ford? He did hide out twice at his Muskoka cottage. Maybe he had “hidden” Covid-19 at the same time. Ford would never tell the truth. #VoteFordOut #NeverVoteConservative #onpoli
"@JulieMDPanneton Ok. But Quebec responded to a challenging situation quickly &amp; shifted its restrictions.

@NikaDragomira @fordnation @SCC_eng And the Privatization of healthcare! And education (private schools were given free PPE when public schools were not)…just the start.

@mrbecigneul These kids are smarter than the #TruckersForFreedom and .@Alberta_UCP and .@CPC_HQ
@demetriosnAB I would expect that post-secondary insMMMMMMutions would know and do better than the UCP government. #abed School boards too.
@jkenney Being in a room full of any kind of unmasked people is unsafe in this #Omicron pandemic.  Where is the filtration and ventilation? How are you going to protect parents from getting infected?
@danrueck That's pretty stupid .@OttawaPolice  You are letting them restock fuel?  Does that mean you wasted .@OttFire time? Was it just PR?  We see you colluding with #OttawaOccupation all across Canada. #cdnpoli .@ottawacity
@AnaPoilievre Not a chance. Just look at who you and .@PierrePoilievre have aligned yourselves with. #cdnpoli https://t.co/0dHv1lSUac
"@Graphicgrl @benFranklin2018 @gwensnyderPHL At this point write politicians. The cyclists in Vancouver were successful to a degree, even if the police didn't back them. Most cities that act decisively can get the truckers to keep moving.  Where police fail / collude with truckers the truckers stay. #Ottawa #Coutts"
@GlobalCalgary It's political science aka knuckling to the #TruckersForFreedom2022
"@flynnrita149 @peggy_blair @IshatReza #abpoli and .@RCMPAlberta can meditate on how their ""negotiations"" with the #FluTruxKlan went wrong at the #Coutts border crossing."
@TrishaMortimore @gill_godwin @OttawaPolice I hope everyone remembers that .@PierrePoilievre supports the #FluTruxClan
@KANADAZERO @Normsens @RichardBethell @CBCOttawa If RCMP can destroy the supplies and houses of land defenders in the forest they can seize diesel facilitating this #OttawaSiege
@RichardKnack @JyotiGondek Kenney has never cared about seniors. In the beginning he thought those that were dying had already exceeded their average life expectancy. Sickening. #Senicide
"@MikeSington .@JimmyKimmelLive must be naive. Yes, it's ""shocking"" that Giuliani is on a show (even though Spicer entered a dance contest), but this is .@FOXTV - boot-lickers for Trump for years. Maybe we will soon see .@RepMTG or .@mattgaetz or other #INSURRECTIONISTS  Besides, Rudy needs $$"
@rainbeausnap @jkenney Especially considering Hinshaw admitted she won't eat in restaurants. #COVIDisAirborne and she knows the science.
"@AndrewNoymer We should have started some time ago. Time is wasting while people are dying.  Win win. Good jobs doing upgrades. People are healthier. What's not to love?  Also, not just schools - everywhere. #cdnpolitics"
"@kendrasmills I only used mine to access medical care, interestingly enough.  They provide no reRRRRRRurance to me when the science says #COVIDisAirborne and anyone can spread it, especially now They did encourage a lot of people to get vaccinated though, that's the main benefit in my view."
@LeahMueller13 @whynot1or2 @UBCDrBenCh @UBC .@UNBC et al are UNIVERSITIES and should be following the best science to fight #COVID19
"@jasonb2b @SteveUBC You may be right. But it would fight back against the lie of ""nothing is going on everything is OK let's get back to normal"" Also, we need stories and pictures of people struggling with #LongCOVID and we need someone to count these cases."
@TiredMamaG @gilmcgowan Giving up is what .@jkenney and .@Alberta_UCP do best #BestSummerEver
@elonmusk @aginnt There are no counter protests because there is a very contagious pandemic. Those who would protest are keeping themselves and their loved ones safe. They are expressing their disgust online - see #GoHomeTruckers etc There would also be climate protests but for the pandemic.
"@JeffGrigg1 @SteveUBC No one wants to fight. People say #ZeroCovid and are told it's not possible. So many are convinced. People say NZ is failing, when they are winning Most politicians are wimps. Simple solutions (vaccines will save us) don't work for complex shifting problems, and people lose trust"
@JeffGrigg1 @SteveUBC Absolutely. I remember being horrified when we saw the bodies pile up in Italy and New York (seems so long ago) and later the catastrophe in Canadian long term care homes.  It's happening again and crickets.  #media can do better than continuous coverage of truckers and chaos
"@SandraSherida18 @MichaelCS1971 @Line_Fault @edmundacuto94 @rcmpgrcpolice @RCMPAlberta I was in Clayoquot too with WCWC. Seeing what has happened recently at Fairy Creek and Wetsuweten (people who actually have a cause) in contrast to the empathy #coutts truckers are getting from the RCMP in ""negotiations"" UGH!  Now they've allow reinforcements to gather."
@ShelleyHoem Especially the truckers at the #coutts blocking shelves from being stocked.
@anniegirl1138 .@CandiceBergenMP and .@PierrePoilievre have been co opted by the #FluTrucksClan  'patriots' is what they call themselves Any Canadian seeing the flags and war memorial shenanigans considers them anything but.
@SteveUBC At this point deaths have become stats. We need the #media to do stories with photos. Deaths = body bags. Mourning families. Funerals. Photos of kids in hospital. Distraught parents. Photos of people in ICU. Scare people I don't know how many care about healthcare workers anymore
"@TheShane73 @whiteford_tyler @JoseA0893 @LucaPedd @glhawryluk @saints_gambit While there is COVID circulating it's not safe for anyone 'healthy' or not. The best option is #ZeroCOVID so everyone can be free.  It is impossible to ""protect those at risk"" - look at the care homes, again. Still at risk and unprotected 2 years on. Unvaccinated kids in hospital"
@InspiredAquaCA @JanMalcolm67 @realreporter @adriandix That's criminal negligence! #bcpoli Also #COVIDisAirborne
@jordanbpeterson @PremierScottMoe @jkenney @fordnation The premier buckling to this mob at this time is just encouraging them. BTW if those who support health measures went out to protest (but we won't because there is a pandemic raging) we would far outnumber these clowns #FluTruxKlan #TruckersForFreedom2022 #covid19sk #Saskatchewan
@JustinTrudeau I hope you and your children make a full recovery with no lasting impacts.  Please think about what you can do to stop the spread and eliminate COVID. #COVIDZero

"@jppatchr @lehayno1 @Aquinning @Tarnjitkparmar @CityNewsVAN And it would be great if the province actually did something to make in clRRRRRR instruction safer. #bcpoli is just letting #COVID19 run rampant. So, the schools should be online until the end of the wave."
@rshingwind @Irishman727 My hubby and I also have no use for these quarterbacks and it was a happy weekend at our house. I'm not watching until some team hires Kaepernick.  #BoycotttNFL
@FreedomTVR @GOP It's so sad. So many Americans aren't even trying to stop it and thousands are dying every day. Where is the outrage? It's like 9/11 EVERY DAY and people just want their #Freedumb to die.
"@KevinChevrier @mrs_lose @KevinCTV @jkenney Kenney is lying. Is he supporting the Maverick Party now, or just can resist even the most sorry excuse of a lie to dump on Trudeau?

"@daveyoung84 @Brian_Orak @PunditPandemic @Theresa_Chapple I understand this guy changed his mind. I follow others who support #ZeroCovid , but I won't subject them to additional negative tweets by sharing."
@BrookLindsay @OntTor @JustinTrudeau Exactly. So why do so many think it wouldn't happen with #COVID19
"@JustinTrudeau The provinces should have planned for filtration, #vaccination , ventilation, #N95sForAll #testing BEFORE the kids were sent to school. Now schools are just vectors of disease. Vaccines are not enough. https://t.co/0YBYyMkwma"
"@marroe_marty @SethAbramson Yes he's fighting an uphill battle but we CAN protect ourselves, some better than others This is why N95 masks are being sent out to everyone. It's your best form of protection from infection right now. If you don't breathe in other people's #COVID19 infected air you can't get it"
@JustinTrudeau That's nice. But what about #N95sForAll and elastomeric respirators? What about filtration and ventilation? Prevention of #COVID19 should be number one right now. .@CPHO_Canada .@jyduclos
"@pmakela1 @GermanyDiplo ""Ukraine and the West have different interpretations of what support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity means in practice."" I haven't seen much fulfillment of this promise. #UkraineCrisis #Ukraina  https://t.co/LF3agZdJfm"
"@JustinTrudeau Vaccine + like .@CPHO_Canada says Now what we need is air purified from very contagious the airborne virus. What are federal plans? The provinces, esp BC and AB, are failing.

"@CoralynnGehl Tell her to lie and say the symptoms have gotten worse overnight, and the rule is ""to stay home if you are sick"". The principle should be on the side of science. #COVIDisAirborne and I bet those kids are eating lunch indoors together."

@cbchelen @AllieJaynes @AngelaSterritt Persistent brain fog is not a good sign. Here is some research about this. Start looking into how to deal with #LongCovid  https://t.co/11F0pT1upR
"@Liberalism2021 @corman_irene @PennyDaflos @DFisman @FurnessColin ""We will all get #OmicronVariant "" is a lie.  This is much more contagious and deadly than the flu. I posted it in response to the ""it is mild"" lie. And people ARE ending up in hospital from it. https://t.co/hK3FOvhciJ"
"@jyduclos I support vaccines, but I don't think vaccination will make that much difference NOW. The emergency is NOW. Health measures, especially those that deal with airborne transmission is what is needed NOW. Vaccinated people can get #COVID19 too. We need people NOT to get it. 👇 https://t.co/u4U16PVrgA"
@mtnbvan @MerlinofCanada In AB we haven't been the first to get a COVID strain. There are always other countries to look to for patterns. There is modelling which predicted this particular wave by early Dec. In a pandemic you have to act fast. You also need to implement what you learn. #COVIDisAirborne
@Mellith @TeacherAlberta @JanisIrwin @taimhuynh @jkenney So for .@AdrianaLaGrange and .@jkenney mRRRRRR infection is better than #onlinelearning - got it. #COIVD19AB
@GarnettGenuis I don't think Justin Trudeau caused this anger between Canadians. My friend's desire to imprison all antivaxxers  stems from his constant pain and delayed surgery caused by hospitals full of unvaccinated #COVID19 patients - 4th wave. .@jkenney 's negligence is implicated too.
@SCARRED_BY_UCP @stephwj76 @DJS761 @AlleyBee23 @merry123459 @MBGov I think the .@albertateachers (union) should fight to make your work place safe so you don't get #COVID19

"@midwestcowboy89 @shoffmanAB It does suck. She did everything right.
