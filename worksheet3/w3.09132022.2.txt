He was way too busy with his schooling and Quidditch to do much of anything.  Fortunately for us, this changes in The Goblet of Fire.. but I'm getting ahead of myself. <br />Starting from the beginning, Harry once again finds himself at the Dursleys... and whisked back to Hogwarts by Mr. Weasley, but not before George sabotages Dudley with his newly invented Ton-Tongue Toffee.  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he is shocked to hear that the Interhouse Quidditch Championship won't be held because Hogwarts, along with preppy Beauxbatons and cold, indifferent Durmstrang, will be participating in the ultimate wizarding trial: the recently-brought-back Triwizard Tournament. Each school will have one representative.  From Beauxbatons, Fleur Delacour was chosen; from Durmstrang, Viktor Krum; and from Hogwarts, Cedric Diggory... One problem: the Goblet of Fire enters another Hogwarts student into the Triwizard Tournament.  Who?  Duh.. Harry.   <br />Throughout the three trials of the Tournament, Harry learns to rely on his friends more than ever.  He also is in for the shock of his life when he and Cedric are transported to an open field, where they witness a horrible deed: Lord Voldemort (aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who) has risen and is back in his body.  Voldemort then kills Cedric (who is dating Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw Quidditch player and secret love of Harry [yes, he finally likes someone]) and duels Harry.  Who wins?  Duh.. Harry- but barely.  The rest is just anticlimactic and thus not worthy of mentioning here. <br />Overall rating: much better than Prisoner of Azkaban and one of Rowling's best.  100,000/100	2005-10-04

This is the fourth book in the series, and the movie version will be coming out soon. I just finished reading this book for the second or third time since it first debuted, and the story holds up just as strongly, if not even stronger, this time. I think the intricacy of the plot gets lost on us fans and readers sometimes, but Rowling has superbly crafted the plot and deftly reveals the story of Harry Potter in such a way that leaves us both satisfied and yet eagerly clamouring for more. I cannot wait to finally read the \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" and then the long-awaited final book in the series. Ms. Rowling has left her indelible imprint on both the literary field and our culture as a whole, and as both an adoring fan and an envious fellow writer, I'm very glad I've in some small way been able to share in this magical tale.<br /><br />If you still haven't entered into this world, you should introduce yourself to Harry Potter now.<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks[...]	2005-10-04

It is my personal favorite of all the six books. It's longer, has a fantastic plot, and best (or worst?) of all, a very unexpected ending that is just so suspenseful!<br /><br />It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts and there are some mysterious things going on. Oddly, Harry ends up having to participate in a new, dangerous contest taking place at the school for which he's not even age-eligible. How come Harry ended up in this perilous event, and, most importantly, what's the reason behind all these strange occurrences?<br /><br />JK Rowling introduces us to a few new characters in the book, a few new characters you'll definitely love! The plot is simply wonderful, and I believe the novel is extremely well-written. Even though this book is slightly darker than the previous one, it's still a great story for all ages to enjoy, especially Harry Potter fans!<br /><br />If you have read the previous Harry Potter books, I guarantee you that you'll enjoy the fourth book very much. It's also a simply fantastic base for the three books to come (two of which have already been published). Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire makes the Wizarding world seem darker, more complicated, and scarier, but more fun, too!	2005-09-06

He gets sprung early by the Weasleys to attend the Quidditch World Cup, but not before the Dursley and Weasley families meet with hilarious results.  The World Cup is exciting but the celebration ends on an ominous note.<br /><br />Once at school Harry and friends learn that there will be a yearlong competition, the Triwizard Tournament involving two other schools.  As the competition progresses it becomes apparent that there are those who have goals beyond fostering ties in the wizarding community.  The ending is dramatic, foreshadowing future events.<br /><br />This is the fourth book in the series, if you are a fan of the series this is a must read, although I would not recommend this for the very young.

So far I have read the first 4 books. They do keep getting better, I will say that, and in my opinion, this book was the best one so far. I have never read a book quite this long before, but somehow, the 753 pages did not drag all that much. Sure she definitely could use a better editor and some scenes could go or be cut, but on the whole, it hung together very nicely. I liked the small plot variation in this one, because I must admit, it does get old having the same plot all the time. This book takes a much more serious tone than the previous ones, and ends with the return of Voldemort. However, I found it more believable than the others. I am looking forward to getting the next two books and completing my \\"experiment.\\" Hope this is helpful to the one or two people in the world who have not yet read these! ;)	2005-08-22

The story turns significantly darker, and such topics as torture, terror, and murder are all prevelent in the book.  In short, it's not quite as innocent and unassuming as the first three books.<br /><br />What it is though is fantastically well written, with the characters developing far more depth and developing the first real stirrings of romantic feelings, as naive and innocent as they may be.  J.K. Rowling again manages to construct a page-turner-- keeping the pace fast, the prose reasonably light, and the story quite interesting.  I dinged this one a star because it feels a bit disjoint and there are elements of the story that seem to be a bit less focused and essential than others-- everything felt critical in the first three books, but parts of this don't.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it's a superb book, but it's the first one in the Harry Potter series I'd think that parents should definitely read before their children to make sure they feel it's altogether appropriate-- it is significantly darker and may be harder to deal with for younger children.	2005-08-10

It gave the book a Scooby Doo ending. What is a Scooby Doo ending you ask? Well, it is when the Scooby Doo bunch - in this case, the Harry Potter bunch, catch the criminal/wizard behind it all, and the accused throws away all of their 5th amendment rights (well, who says they don't have that in the wizarding world?) and makes a complete confession for all the world to hear.<br /><br />\\"If it wasn't for your meddling kids!... (confession, confession)\\"<br /><br />And I think it screws up the book. Mind, not to spoil the book to those who have not yet read it. This book has an amazingly intricate plot, which is good. And then they give the wizard who caused it all veritaserum at the end and he explains everything. Sort of like Quirrell in The Sorcerer's Stone. I mean, was it really necessary for him to talk that much? Why do criminals/dark wizards feel the need to discuss their evil maniacal plans at liberty to those to so obviously oppose them? It's too simplistic.<br /><br />Oh well. So aside from that hang up/gripe, I still say this book was enjoyable. It was a long read, which is a good thing because you can pretend you are not a muggle and enjoy Harry's adventures longer.	2005-08-07

Well, it is when the Scooby Doo bunch - in this case, the Harry Potter bunch, catch the criminal/wizard behind it all, and the accused throws away all of their 5th amendment rights (well, who says they don't have that in the wizarding world?) and makes a complete confession for all the world to hear.  <br /> <br />\\"If it wasn't for your meddling kids!... (confession, confession)\\" <br /> <br />And I think it screws up the book. Mind, not to spoil the book to those who have not yet read it. This book has an amazingly intricate plot, which is good. And then they give the wizard who caused it all veritaserum at the end and he explains everything. Sort of like Quirrell in The Sorcerer's Stone. I mean, was it really necessary for him to talk that much? Why to criminals/dark wizards feel the need to discuss their evil maniacal plans at liberty to those to so obviously oppose them? It's too simplistic. <br /> <br />Oh well. So aside from that hang up/gripe, I still say this book was enjoyable. It was a long read, which is a good thing because you can pretend you are not a muggle and enjoy Harry's adventures longer.	2005-08-07

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth book in the Harry Potter series, is a must read, just as all of the others are. This book may seem kind of long, but the plot and suspense is so great, you really don't even notice. <br />The fourth installment of the Harry Potter series begins not with Harry, but in one of Harry's dreams, which may or may not be really happening. That's for you to decide. After going to the Quidditch (a wizarding sport) World Cup with Ron and his family and witnessing disaster caused by the followers of Voldemort, the Death Eaters, Harry returns to Hogwarts, his wizarding school and is somehow thrown into a tournament that he wasn't even supposed to be able to enter. He knows that someone who is at least 17 must have put his name in the Goblet of Fire, which draws the names for the tournament. As he tries to find out who might want him killed, he is faced with the challenges that are in the tournament. And who knows? Maybe there will be a surprise at the end. <br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite book in the Harry Potter series so far.It keeps you guessing until the very end. I would suggest reading the first three books before reading this one, but I would really like to say that this book is great for fantasy or mystery lovers, as Harry Potter has a lot of both. <br />	2005-07-22

I definitely put this at the bottom of the series.  The end is excellent, but the rest of the book is really slow and very poorly thought out.  The bit with the port keys was ludicrous. Voldermort's inside man could have just made Harry's book a portkey. Or asked him to bring him something off of the shelf which was, or any of a thousand different ways.  The whole driving force behind the plot (and all of the slow writing) is thus completely nullified.  I realize that kids might not pick up on this, and like the cheesy romance we were forced to endure.   <br /> <br />It thus falls solidly into the catagory of children's literature - not for adults who could see through the gaping plot holes and poor construction.	2005-07-19

To be in the company of his best friends Ron and Hermione, with whom he has shared many a preternatural adventure, is a glowing wish.  Complete exoneration of the Dudleys' horrific nephew-management, a yearning that soon becomes fulfilled.  In Goblet of Fire, the reader will see Harry Potter as a truly happy fourteen year old boy.<br /><br />For a short while.  Then mysterious, secret things begin to happen.  What seems amusing to some becomes a reality of causative catastrophe.  Demonic events unfold beneath the reader's very nose, without him or her being aware of it.  J. K.

Goblet of Fire takes first place as a modern mystery whodunnit, out-twisting even Prisoner of Azkaban.<br /><br />The skillful writing of Rowling's hand intermingles, entwines, and combines sub-plot after sub-plot, until the amalgam of Harry's universe is entirely realistic; the reader's brain swells with concentration.  The details are enormous in count.  One must re-read the book to seize every known factor, simply to comprehend.<br /><br />Pretty soon, the days begin to look grim, and not just for Harry.  Who would want to go out with Hermione, the bushy haired, big-toothed know-it-all?  When will Ron ever get a chance to step out of Harry's shadow?

And why doesn't the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor trust anyone?  Secrets, that's why!  In \\"The Beginning,\\" Rowling exposes Hogwarts castle to a terror unmistakably foreign to its innocent occupants.<br /><br />Rowling's book is a literal vector transporting all of us far away from our own distorted lives, directly into the bubbling turmoil that is the wizarding community.

But as clever as they are (with Muggles), almost toying with \\"our\\" world (as is evident in earlier books), the overall camaraderie between individuals in Goblet of Fire proves that many wizards and witches, be they malicious or virtuous, are passionate.

Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire is the spectacular fourth book in the popular Harry Potter series. However it is also the darkest book of the series so far. This book retains the wild and fun fantasy that makes the world of Harry Potter so fun and original. However this is and remains the darkest book of the series because it is the first of the series to have death as an underlying theme.<br /><br />In this book Harry Potter is about fourteen years old. He is beginning to come into his own as an adolescent. He has his first crush; he starts to rebel against his abusive aunt and uncle and he wants to spend time with his friends. When his friends invite him to the Quidditch World Cup Harry happily accepts, not knowing that this event is going to be the start of how his world will change forever.<br /><br />Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire is a integral turning point of the Harry Potter series and it clearly shows. The characters show their maturity, and each of them is showing the development of their own individual personalities. They are also showing attractions to the opposite sex in this book as well.<br /><br />The violence in this book is intense for a children's book but it is not gratuititous as it could have been. There are 3 deaths, self-mutilation, and animal attacks but somehow, Rowling avoids having things overly bloody.<br /><br />In conclusion, Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire is an instant classic. It is sure to surprise and delight many Potter fans for generations to come. The rating that I give this book is 5 stars.	2005-04-26

If you find any of those things interesting, then read this book! Harry Potter's life is centered around these three paranormal entities. An orphan at only one year of age, it takes not a genius to infer that Harry has not lived the life of an average 14 year old. In fact, at the tender age of one, he endured an attempt on his life by the most powerful dark wizard since Grindelwald in 1945. Lord Voldemort began his reign of terror several years before Harry was born, killing everyone who stood in his path. One night, he went to the Potter's house seeking to kill them all. He killed Harry's parents easily, but when he tried to kill Harry, the curse rebounded upon himself leaving Lord Voldemort powerless and Harry with a lightning-bolt shaped scar. Now, Harry is a 14 year old whose scar hurts when Lord Voldemort is near or feeling especially murderous. At 734 pages, this book is just some light reading.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth book in this thrilling fantasy series is pivotal. To me, this is my second favorite book in the series behind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix since the deeper you get into the series the more excitement there is. Unlike previous novels, there is no school Quidditch teams as something larger is happening at Hogwarts - The Triwizard Cup. Every book shows Harry overcoming some difficulty and this event proves to be Harry's predicament in this gripping novel. Every time that you think that you have figured out where this novel is going, it takes another twist. However, the climax of this novel could be expected if you consider what it would take to make the series exciting a few books later. Also, many new characters are added such as a poisonous columnist, Rita Skeeter, as well as characters from Beuaxbatons and Durmstrang, rival European Magic Schools competing against Hogwarts in the Triwizard cup.  Naturally death is something that Harry has been accustomed to, but could be prepared for suddenness of it.<br /><br />The Harry Potter series is full of morals so naturally it did not surprise me due to the nature of this fabulous book that it would continue the series' moral that  \\"It is our choices, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\\"  This book is written in a way that is suited to all audiences. After all, it is about a teenager dealing with much more adult situations. I recommend it to any one who enjoys suspense novels. I am a person who scares easily, yet even due to the horrifying nature of some scenes, I truly found this novel thrilling.prepared for suddenness of it.<br /><br />The Harry Potter series is full of morals so naturally it did not surprise me due to the nature of this fabulous book that it would continue the series' moral that  \\"It is our choices, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\\"  This book is written in a way that is suited to all audiences.

I stopped reading those books until now. I've realized how great of a book the fourth installment is and to say kids arent the only ones who like these books. In the fourth installment of Harry Potter, its a more action packed and darker tale of Harry Potter. It is also much different than the other 3 years. For there is a Triwizard tournament and no Quidditch because of it. A dream about You-Know-Who makes Harry Potter to be more careful. Also, the characters are basically well, you get to know them like they are your best friends. Its not a blatant description either but more of a learning from their actions. So, in all this is an amazing book. I'd have to say I was impressed. The worst thing about this book is it seems like you read for hours and you dont even put a dent in the amount of pages it has. But I am glad it was a long book as well as the 5th one. If your not into fantasy, stay away from these books, because you will probably hate them, or maybe not, these are just that good.	2005-02-19

I like to read books with emotion and insight,(not the worthless kind mind you). I'll read the same book twice,(my record's actually ten though, and yaa, I know, a lot of dorks read the same books twice)but I will never read the exact same kind of book twice, and I know a lot of other readers wont either, so what's the point of five bloody books? This book's characters are  typical. You know, I didn't mind The Lord of the Rings crazy dwarfs and stuff, but this book's out-thereness is kinda dumb. The auther has so many terms.(but not nearly as worse as The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe)This book's actually kinda boring. It just skipps from one thing to the next without really getting into each characters reactions, feelings, or actions.(The characters don't have habits or opinions that they take to action.)<br /><br />  I can understand why 8 year olds might like it, or even 13 year olds, but adults? Come on adults rave on about something different. Oh yaa, and stop blaming your disdain towards your kids on Harry  Potter. Dissect somthing like your parenting skills.	2005-01-23

After a three-year hiatus since middle school, I finally had the opportunity to return to the world of Harry Potter. The Goblet of Fire picks up where the Prisoner of Azkaban left off, where Harry is a year older and a year wiser while attending his fourth year at Hogwarts. Life is far from usual, even for this young wizard, as Harry struggles with the harrowing challenges of the Triwizard Tournament, the negative publicity from yellow journalist Rita Skeeter, and the trials of growing up. This fourth installment expanded on the Harry Potter universe, revealing that the world of magic is not limited to Britain, with witches and wizards of all nationalities and races and entire magic schools founded in far off countries.<br /><br />The Goblet of Fire is a very imaginative and well-written novel as with the rest of the series. Rowling's novel is vividly written and it gives the reader a good idea of the settings, but it never gets bogged down with extraneous details and leaves enough for the imagination. Because of it's British nature, however, I couldn't get any of the childish \\"humor\\" - alas, what people find funny is an acquired taste. I enjoyed how the plot was more grown up than any of the previous novels, to fit a more mature audience and a more mature Harry. While this is one of the longest books of the series, much of the first few chapters seem to be all filler. I could have done without some of the events, such as Hermione's one-girl, house-elf civil rights movement and all the little side conversations between characters. While these sequences perpetuated character development, reading them felt laborious.<br /><br />As I saw Harry grow up over the course of the series, it was easy to feel sympathy for his character. Not only is he an ordinary person thrown into a torrent of extraordinary events, he struggles to cope with life - as with any teenager. With many plot lines left dangling at the end of this book, four more years at Hogworts and adolescence left for Harry (and four more books to go no doubt), there are still plenty of ways for our hero to get into trouble and face death again.

I am not a Harry Potter fanatic, but I did begin reading the series this summer and finished, #4 just last night. The series has been an easy and enjoyable read. GoF was very intriguing and satisfying at parts. It was the usual combination of fun, mystery, and surprises we've all come to love from #s 1-3. I especially liked the character development of the three main characters that give us an the impression that the characters really are growing up. I \\"flew\\" (at least for me) through this book and ended with a very satisfied feeling. However, this book in the series had way, WAY too much filler. I don't even remember being pulled into the book until about page 350 of 700 or so. The first 300 pages were mindless chit-chat about nothings that really didn't hold my interest much. (Next 2 sentences are a mild spoiler, but not really) The whole house elf liberation deal? Way too much information considering it goes nowhere in the end. I had heard the point of the series was to increase the length of each book as it progresses. I hope this is not the case because the mindless filler was definately evident in #4 and #5 is even longer.	2005-01-10

In 2000, the fourth of J. K. Rowling's exciting books featuring her beloved character of Harry Potter was released.  Entitled \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\", we find Harry once again facing his arch enemy, the very dark wizard whose very name creates great fear within the wizarding world: Lord Voldemort. Towards the end of Harry's summer vacation that he spends with the ever-unpleasant Dursleys (Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Cousin Dudley), Harry received an unexpected invitation to attend the Quidditch World Cup match with the Weasley family (the family of one of Harry's dearest friends, Ron Weasley).  After some obvious objections, Uncle Vernon agrees, but is concerned about how the Weasley's will arrive to pick up Harry.  Instead of arriving in a car as any muggle family would, the Weasleys arrive via their preferred method of transportation: flew powder.  Unfortunately, the Dursley's had converted the fireplace into an electric one; but Arthur Weasley clears the way for the rest of the Weasley clan to arrive by blowing a hole through the chimney wall, which he promises to repair to the fear of the Dursleys.  Being his first time to watch a professional quidditch match, Harry is extremely excited, especially since Arthur obtained the best tickets possible; however a very unusual event occurs following the game: a group of \\"death eaters\\" (supporters of Lord Voldemort) begin to harass a family of muggles at the campsite where so many wizards & witches are staying for the game.  Then, the highly feared symbol of Lord Voldemort appears in the sky causing ever more panic among the guests and disruption for the Ministry of Magic.  A lowly house-elf named Winky takes the blame and is subsequently fired from service to Percy Weasley's boss at the Ministry of Magic, Barty Crouch; but everyone returns to their homes and Harry, Ron and Hermione Granger return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their fourth year.  However, this is going to be a very different year at Hogwarts as there won't be any inter-house quidditch matches.  Instead, a revived Triwizard Tournament will be held between a champion to represent Hogwarts and two other champions each representing other wizarding schools.  Albus Dumbledore sets an age-limit of 17, meaning that no one under that age may participate and as tradition dictates, the impartial Goblet of Fire selects each school's champion.  However, the Goblet of Fire picks not the expected three names of champions, but four, with Harry being the fourth.  Claiming that he did not sneak his name into the goblet, Professor Dumbledore is inclined to believe Harry, but not everyone does.  However, it is clear that someone does want Harry to participate in the dangerous tournament.  The only questions are who, and for what reason?  You'll just have to read this very exciting and compelling book to find out!<br /><br />Each of J.K. Rowling's books about Harry Potter keep getting better and better.  I was very impressed with the first three, but the fourth, at a staggering 734 pages, maintains a high a level of interest throughout with its many unexpected plot twists and turns, and I was impressed with some of the words that J.K. Rowling used that would clearly require a child to inquire within a dictionary to understand the meaning.  Like the previous books, the fourth has several subplots, such as Hermione's determination to free the house-elves, Hagrid's interest in Madame Maxime (the head of one of the French wizarding school known as Beauxbatons), Hermione's apparent interest in Viktor Krum (who not only attends the Durmstrang wizarding school, but is also the very famous Bulgarian quidditch player whose feats during the Quidditch World Cup amazed everyone) and the ongoing mischief from the ghost named Peeves.  A vast assortment of new characters are introduced in the fourth book, including several people from the Ministry of Magic, the new professor against the dark arts ('Mad-Eye' Moody)and the various people from the other wizarding schools.  The book also has several returning characters from the second book (\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\") including Dobby and Moaning Myrtle.<br /><br />Without a doubt, J.K. Rowling's fourth book entitled \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" resoundingly earns 5 out of 5 stars.  The twists and turns that this story takes make predicting its outcome impossible.  I very much look forward to reading the fifth book, as well as the sixth book that will be published in a few months.  I also look forward to the film version of \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" that will be released in theaters later this year.

K. Rowling is the author of this unforgettable fiction masterpiece.<br /><br /> \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" takes place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry.  Hogwarts is located at a hard to find location in the United Kingdom.  This mysterious, exciting, and fun story takes place in 1994.<br /><br /> \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" centers around a Person vs. Person / Good vs. Evil conflict.  Harry is constantly having to defend himself against the antics of the Dark Lord Voldemort and his group of followers called the Death Eaters.  When Harry was a boy Voldemort killed his parents, but he was not able to kill Harry.  He became week and is trying to become more powerful so he can ultimately finish his mission and destroy Harry Potter.<br /><br /> Harry Potter is the 14 year old Protagonist in \\"The Goblet of Fire.\\"  Voldemort is the Antagonist in the book.  Ron Weasly and  Hermione Granger, Harry's best friends, are Static Characters, they stick with Harry through the worst of times.  Doby the House Elf is a Round Character and the majority of Hogwarts students are Stock Characters.<br /><br /> The theme of \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" is the events that take place during the Triwizard Tournament.  The Triwizard Tournament is a three school competition between the Hogwarts, Beauxbaton and Durmstrang schools. It consists of one champion from each school competing against the other champions in a  three event Tournament.  The three school champions for the Triwizard Tournament, which takes place at Hogwarts,  are chosen by an impartial judge, an old cup, given the title The Goblet of Fire.  The winner gets one thousand Galleons, the highest form of wizard  coinage, and prestige for themselves and their school. Harry's name, however, is unexpectedly chosen by the Goblet and he is bound to compete, according to the rules.  The problem is that nobody knows who put Harry's name in the Goblet, because only students seventeen and older were allowed to enter the competition.  Harry believes that whoever put his name in the Goblet has it in for him and wants him to die while competing in one of the Triwizard Tournament tasks.  Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to take every task one at a time and concentrate on making it through all the tasks alive.<br /><br /> J. K. Rowling was very successful in presenting her central idea throughout \\"The Goblet of Fire.\\"  When Professor Dumbledore, the head of Hogwarts, spoke to the students at the opening banquet he clearly stated that the Goblet of Fire would select the most worthy students to compete for  \\"The Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons prize money\\" (Rowling J.K.).  I thought the theme was outstanding and perfectly written.  The book was so exciting I was up till Four A.M. Reading.  All aspects of life are neatly folded into the Harry Potter books in a splendid sort of way.  The recognizable  characters and the way the story flows makes for great reading.  The characters are perfect, with ones you love and others you love to hate. This is a very memorable book and there is one line that I really like in this book, it takes place when Sirius, Harry's Godfather, is talking to Harry, Ron and Hermione.  He says \\"If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals\\"(Rowling J.K.).  This is a great statement that is very true.<br /><br /> So far \\"Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire\\" is my favorite book in the Harry Potter series. It is my favorite book of all time and has influenced many peoples lives, young and old. One of the reasons it is so popular is that everybody can feel as if they are inside the book, going through all of Harry's successes and failures with him. All the characters come to life and you do not wish that there were such things as witches, wizards andmagic,  you know that they are real.  Harry Potter is an amazing story about growing up, making the right choices and learning from your mistakes.magic,  you know that they are real.

Somehow, Harry has been chosen to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, even though he is supposed to be too young to enter. Someone, hoping that Harry will be killed in the tournament, arranged for him to participate--but who is it? All we know is that it is someone at Hogwarts, but there are several suspicious candidates. Meanwhile, it seems that Lord Voldemort is growing stronger and preparing to return. When will he make his appearance...and what does this have to do with the Triwizard Tournament?<br />My interest in the mystery kept me reading quickly--although this is a long book, over 700 pages, I read it in a few days without feeling that I was taxing myself. An exciting book that leaves you anxious to read more of Harry's adventures.	2004-06-22

After a lengthy visit to an international Quiditch match (as a spectator) with his friends and the Weasley family, Harry returns to Hogwarts only to find that he will shortly be competing in a very prestigious contest of his own - against students from other wizarding schools, not just one of his own classmates.<br />In this book, Harry, as appropriate for an adolescent, is subject to mood swings, sulkiness, and indecision, which is his downfall, from minor things like finding a partner for a ball to deciphering the contest clues. At the end, the competition takes a deadly turn, which I will only say involves You Know How. And on a lighter note, Hermione gets her first boyfriend.	2004-06-05

These authors firmly ascribe to the philosophy, \\"why use one page to describe a scene when you can do it in 10 pages?\\"  Some people think that the never-ending stream of prose represents great compositional skill & mastery of the language.  Believe me, any graduate student can pad a seminar paper as skillfully as Rowling has Books 4 & 5, but the graduate student is writing to a different audience.<br />What is going on here?  I am guessing that because of the success of the series, Rowling has been allowed to run amok, and no editor has the nerve to rein in a money-making rogue elephant.  Unfortunately, it appears that Rowling has some difficulty sustaining a coherent narrative over such a long period of time.  I can only imagine what Books 6 & 7 will weigh in at, but it wouldn't surprise me if they end up being 1000-1200 pages apiece.  The narrative will only collapse under the weight of a book that long, and would ruin a series that got off to a good start.  If Rowling is interested in the quality of her work and not simply in raking in the cash, she needs to understand that more is not necessarily better.	2004-06-02

The story brings new and exciting characters, creatures, and breath taking twists. The story starts off two weeks before Harry is to go back to Hogwarts. He is retrieved by his close friends the Weaslys. Where they invite him to join them to spectate at the year's quitich world cup. This year at Hogwarts the quitich season is canceled due to the coming of two new schools and the tri wizard competition. Most of the students were very disappointed but once the competition was under way they forgot all about that years quitich season. I would tell you but I am pretty sure you can already guess who participates for the Hogwarts team. The competition is fierce and treacherous and not only does harry have to think about the Tri-wizard competition but he has Voldemort and his dark followers after him. There are many obstacles in Harry's way see how he escapes death numerous times in the fourth book of the series.<br /> As I read this book I grew more excited and curious. I had many questions and the only way to find the answers was to keep reading. I could almost feel the emotions as Harry set forth at many tasks. J. K. Rowling has out done herself yet again in this better then ever Harry Potter story. If I were to rate this book I would give it 4 out of 5. The only reason I discarded one point was because at times it could get a bit boring. This was only at a few places through out the book. To become a part of the magical word all you have to do is pick up the book and it will take you away in its phenomenal way as it does children from 8 to grandparents at the age of 90.	2004-05-26

Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley are in their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year, the Triwizard Tournament is taking place at Hogwarts. The Triwizard Tournament involves several dangerous tasks to measure a wizard's magical abilities. The Triwizard Tournament hasn't taken place in over a century due to the death toll climbing too high. Harry has been chosen as a competitor in this tournament. The only problem is that Harry didn't enter the contest. Follow Harry as he tries to win the tournament and tries to survive the dangerous tasks ahead. The evil Lord Voldemort will face Harry once again in this exciting book. This time though, Lord Voldemort is backed by his followers, the infamous Death Eaters.<br /> J. K. Rowling really pulls you into her world of mystical creatures and magic. The complex, fast-paced plot is intriguing and unforgettable. I really enjoyed this book because the vivid descriptions seem to draw you into the wizarding world. Also, the plot had many twists and turns so the ending was not at all predictable. The book looks at the challenges of being a teenager realistically, which is hard to do, while keeping the magical theme. Humorous dialogue and themes of friendship make Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in the series, but in my opinion, the best.  Don't take my word for it though. Buy it from your local bookstore or retailer today.  Believe me, you won't regret it!	2004-03-07

Harry is back at Hogwarts for his fourth year of seven, and he is in a big surprise this year.  This year there is no Quidditch Cup instead there is a Triwizard Tournament, and a member from each school is selected, but some how so is Harry.  Other characters that are picked to participate are Viktor Krum from Durmstrang, Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts and also Harry.  Everyone in the three school was surprised in the outcome.  Harry couldn't believe it neither.  The first of three competitions was to get the egg of the dragon you picked out of the sack before the competition.  Harry faced the Hungarian Horntail the toughest of all the dragons in the tournament.  His task was to snatch the golden egg hidden under the dragon, while dodging the attacks the dragon was throwing at him.  Will Harry make it alive of will he fall to his dome?  The next task was the go  swimming in the school lake for something that is very precious to you, but before that you had to crack the code of how to find out what it was.  Harry didn't know what was taken from him until he asked where is Ron.  Then he relized it was Ron at the bottom of the lake.  Does Harry exceed or does time run out and he never sees Ron again?  Last, but not least the final task has come, and it is a giant maze which you have to get to the center of the become the champion.  Sounds easy huh, but on the way there you have to pass numerous obsticels, and deadly animals.  So does Harry win the tournament?  If he does what happens after that?  Is he famous?

I have a tendency to write a summarized comment of these HP books I read as well as other books. First I want to say that HP5 was a great read in my opinion - although a long one. Despite its length I had a hard time putting the book down in the morning times when I could read it. I tried to read as much of it up until I was running late for work. The only disadvantage I found with the extra length of this installment was the endless backtracking by the author. I kept reading about Harry's experiences from his previous years to where I just about tore my hair out from its roots. Repeatedly I kept saying to myself -- YES, I know this already, I read HP1 - HP3! The backtracking that the author should have exercised more was when she had the characters hint about what had happened the previous year through their dialogue. One example, in HP3, Madame Pomfrey is relieved to hear the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Lupin is somewhat versed in curing magical ailments. These kinds of underlying hints give her work a charming reflection on Harry's experiences both old and new. This is not the only installment that the author is guilty of this, but it is the first where it happens the most often. My advice to JKR - just tell the audience they need to read the books in order or otherwise be lost in the process of getting to know Harry Potter entirely.	2004-01-04

But the development of themes in this episode sets it apart - perhaps a reward from Rowling for the enthusiasm of her adult readers as well. A multitude of sub-plots bubble away, each reflecting and commenting on our own world's prejudices and problems, while the action takes no step back to allow for these developments.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was my favorite book out of all four I haven't yet started the fifth one yet, but I pretty sure it's going to more intense and exiting. The way the story goes makes you feel wanting more. Reading something in the beginning without even knowing why it's there in the first makes you think if the answers going to come up soon. That's the way this book started. For instance, the person who put Harry's name in the goblet was Mad-Eye-Moody which turned out to be the son of Barty Crouch pretending to be Moody. Finding out all these things makes you wanting more and wanting to figure out the other stuff that doesn't make sense. Another Example is when Winky, Mr. Crouch's house elf was at the top of the box at the quidditch game saving him a seat. By reading on you find out that Mr. Crouch's son was in the empty seat with an invisibility coat on. All Harry Potter books are mysterious and adventures. I recommend the books to anyone that enjoys mysterious and adventures books. You know what; I recommend this book to anyone.	2003-12-15

I don't understand why some people think the Harry potter books are evil. The Harry Potter books to me are friendly and nice. Yes,they have magic in them but when they have magic it's ethier for good to help Harry,Ron and Hermonie to get away from the the bad guys. Or something silly that Harry is learning in one of his classes. I like the Harry Potter books alot because even though I'm in college I can go back and relate to what ethier Harry or Ron or Hermonie is going though. I think if you can relate to a book it makes it more instring and you want to read it more.<br />I think all ages should be able to open the book and enjoy them. I think middle schools and maybe even high schools should be reading the Harry Potter books.<br />Last but not least, I did not really like reading that much before. But, when I started reading Harry Potter books I liked it because they were funny and i could relate to the books. I think everyone should at least read one book of Harry Potter to see what they think.	2003-12-15

But once you start reading it you get in to it, and you wonder what might happen next. So far I have read all four of the Harry Potter books and this was one that I like the most. I really like the fact that they don't have the Quidditch games no more I like the fact that in oder to play the game you have to be 17 years or older, because there is more danger out there. Once you read this book you'll want to read the 5th book because I know I do. I like the fact that they show how kids really are know, they get jealous of each other and that's how kids really do act. If you have read the first three books I recommend you to read the fourth because to me that's the best and it might be yours too.	2003-12-15

This book is alot like the Wizard of Oz in some ways. Like in the wizard of Oz the little girl Dorothy is trying to get home and she has to get away from the witch. Yes there is that word \\"Witch\\". Why don't they try to ban that book and movie? It deals with witches as does the Harry Potter books. If you haven't read the book I recomend you start reading it. It has to do alot with friendship. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are always helping each other out. Harry doesn't care if Ron is poor or that Hermione is not a pure bred wizard. He accepts them for who they are and not where they come from. It is much like what kids face each day. Most of them get picked on because they don't have what others have or because they look a different way or are a different color of skin. The author of these books covers all of that in the series. I think that this a very good book to read, as are the first 3. I suggest you read it once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down. Especially when you get to the part when Harry is captured by Voldemort and he manages to escape with the help of his dead father.	2003-12-15

As an adult reader, I was hesitant at first to get into the Harry Potter series. However, after finally giving into the hype, I decided to pick up the 1st book and absolutely fell in love with Hogwarts. Despite the length, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is possibly my favorite book in the series. The magical world outside of Hogwarts gets explored a little more in this book, starting at the Quidditch World Cup. And instead of the traditional Quidditch House Cup, 3 wizarding schools compete in the Triwizard tournament to crown a single hero and champion. But don't be fooled, the real magic of this book still lies within the walls of Hogwarts and the spell-binding adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Don't blink or you just might miss something.	2003-12-01

The Goblet of Fire is about as long as the previous three Harry Potter books put together.  I was worried going into this that the magic would run out - that Rowling might have been caving under the pressure of having to produce a Harry Potter book each year.  Some of the reviews I had read suggested as much.<br />Well, the magic is still going strong.  True, this is a long book (we do not arrive at Hogwarts until around page 200), but, like Harry, I want to spend as much time at Hogwarts as possible.  The story is just as engrossing here as in the previous novels.  This, in fact, may be my favorite so far.<br />The story concerns a contest amongst several schools of wizardry.  The book begins with Lord Voldemort so I don't think I'm giving too much away by saying he has something interesting planned for Harry in the tournament.<br />This is darker than the previous two books.  The similarity with Lord of the Rings becomes more apparent.  As Harry grows up, circumstances become more and more dire.  I have not yet read Order of the Phoenix, but I am looking forward to it.	2003-11-26

To begin with, I wasn't so impressed with this entry. After the lean and to-the-point mystery of Prisoner of Azkaban I was bored to tears with the pointlessly long and empty opening of Goblet of Fire. The first 100 pages are the slowest and most boring so far in the Harry Potter books. I urge you to skip the first few chapters (up until the badly described and confusing 'riot' at the Quidditch World Cup) and get straight to Harry aboard the Hogwarts Express as nothing of interest happens before this point.<br /><br />But once back at Hogwarts all the usual hi-jinks start. There is yet another Defense Against the Black Arts teacher (even weirder this time), the usual hassle from Malfoy, rumors of Lord Voldemort's return to power coincide with Harry's scar hurting, but no Quidditch. Instead two other Wizard schools (Durmstrang and Beauxbatons) bring their best students to visit for the whole year to participate in the Triwizard tournament. A sort of Olympic Games for Wizards, but only three (chosen by the Goblet of Fire) are allowed to complete.<br /><br />But somehow the Goblet spits out a fourth entry (Harry), giving Hogwarts two chances to win the tournament. Much to the annoyance of almost every other student as they all think he wants to be centre of attention again. But even worse for Harry because he didn't enter the tournament because he didn't want to and he was too young. But someone put his name forward and once again Harry has to risk his life while solving a dozen mysteries.<br /><br />This book is nowhere near as fast paced as PoA and sometimes it seems that Rowling is far too at ease with her catatonic way of developing the plot. I would have preferred if it were more concentrated and wasted no time. I never felt like I was getting anywhere with it no matter how many chapters I read. But by the end, when the plot threads are tied together (and some left annoyingly hanging) the book feels more wholesome but the payoff still doesn't feel as big as it should be for trudging all the way through a slow story with a beginning so slow it's almost going backwards.<br />I sure hope The Order of the Phoenix is better.ld be for trudging all the way through a slow story with a beginning so slow it's almost going backwards.<br />I sure hope The Order of the Phoenix is better.	2003-11-08

I remember vividly the year 2000, the summer where the anticipation for the fourth book of the Harry Potter adventure finally reached a boiling point with its release, immediately becoming the fastest-selling book in history. The book was the longest in the series so far and undoubtedly the most exciting. For startes, the traditional Quidditch championship which Gryffindor had won the year previous was cancelled for the Triwizard Tournament, which introduced a whole bevy of characters from different parts of the world. Quidditch fans get their fix at the beginning, however, at the raucous Quidditch World Cup: packed with colorful surroundings and great details, the whole sequence is written with great prose and humour.<br />The three Triwizard tasks are also written brilliantly, Rowling seamlessly blending humour, anticipation and dread into each paragraph. Rita Skeeter is a new character, a despicable journalist who makes life a living hell for Harry with fradulant stories, another sign of Harry's maturity and Rowling's increasing worldview: journalism problems! No doubt something she's experienced since Harry Potter has become a worldwide phenomenon. At almost 700 pages, this book never drags in its sections of description as Rowling continues to captivate us with her magical world. Surprise, a fourth brilliant read.	2003-09-01

Like the old english classics by Dickens and Shakepeare it has transcended the boundaries of nations and languages.<br />  And that is the point I am making. Harry Potter's universal appeal is due to the fact that it depicts an experience that is common to almost all the literate people of the world: spending childhood at school. In Harry Potter we see a reflection of ourselves doing all the things that we had so deeply desired to do but never could do. By making us relive our school lives in a heroic manner Rowling touches our memory at a place where our feeling are most strong and tender.<br />  We love Harry Potter and associate with it because he is the embodiment of all we had wanted to be. And this association becomes even more strong when we see harry not just basking in glory but facing troubles and crises and quivering under the stress.<br />  In the Goblet of Fire Harry makes a long protracted mistake of going further and further into Voldemort's trap. What appear to successes throughout the novel, turn out to be follies in the end. But as Harry is locked into a combat with Voldemort he once again rises to the occasion and manages to escape.<br />  And so the great Dumnledore becomes aware of Voldemort's return. At the end of the novel a great chapter seems to have been opened in magical history whicn leaves the reader in suspense about what would follow next.<br />  I firmly believe that the sole merit of good literature is that it depicts human nature and its various expression in the face of different situations in the form of thoughts, feelings and much more. By accurately describing the school life of a boy faced with many problems and also gifted with many qualities, the Harry Potter Series and particularly the Goblet of Fire, merits the title of World Classic.	2003-07-19

I let the really dark turn this book took towards the end make me rank it below The Prisoner of Azkaban, but a reread and the ensuing reflection found me ranking this above its predecessor.  With the fourth book, J.K. Rowling turns the Harry Potter series into epic-size proportions and given the recently-released fifth book, it's something that will continue with Books Six and Seven.  In fact the opening chapter of this book hints at what's in store.  The question is when and how?<br />There are two big extra-special events in this book.  The first one is the Quidditch World Cup, where thousands of wizards attend to see Ireland play Bulgaria.  Harry goes with the Weasleys and Hermione to this once-in-a-while gala sporting event, which takes place in the woods.<br />However, mayhem is later caused at the campsite when the Dark Mark, an emerald skull representing Voldemort's supporters, appears in the sky.<br />Meanwhile at Hogwarts, Dumbledore announces the Tri-Wizard competition, revived after its dangerous past, with 6th or 7th formers (16-17 year olds) allowed to compete.  Qualifying students are told to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire.  That eliminates Harry, who is only a fourth former and knowingly does not put his name into the Goblet.  You can imagine what happens, right?<br />Many new developments are taking place.  Fred and George Weasley would rather open up a joke shop, much to the chagrin of their mother, who think they should be putting more emphasis on higher education.  Dudley, Harry's nasty cousin, is their first victim a la the Ton Tongue Toffee, but then again, he deserves it.  Guess what it does?<br />The character of Rita Skeeter, a gossip columnist always looking for dirt on her subjects who would put Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons to shame, is introduced.  Woe be to anyone who crosses her, although one would think the article on Hermione being Harry's girlfriend, though untrue, would be a compliment to Harry and Hermione.

Not only is it funny, dark, and entertaining... but in the long run--- it makes sense! my favorite part about this book is how in the end, EVERYTHING comes together! nothing goes un-notices or overlooked. things that didn't make sense finnaly seem perfectly clear, mysteries are unfogged and misunderstandgins are comprehended with well put explanations. This is, as i said, my favorite Harry Potter book (although i just finished pheonix... so we'll have to see) because of the mysterious happenings and the suspenseful plot and so on. it is a very entertaing and fun book to read. although the size may intimidate some... don't sweat it! you read this book sooo fast, i read it in 3 days because i paced myself because i didn't want it to be over!! i would highly reccomend buying/reading this book. But, i would also highly reccomend reading the previous 3 of the series before hand... just for some backround knowledge. everything will make a lot more sense and the book will be more enjoyable.	2003-06-23

Harry is living with the Dursleys, his muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle.  Harry is unhappy living there, but has no choice.  Underage wizards cannot use magic in the muggle world, so all Harry can do is send his owl to get messages from his friends Ron and Hermione as well as from his god-father Sirius Black.  As the summer winds to a close Harry gets permission to stay with the Weasley family.  Together, they go to the World Cup of Quidditch, which is being hosted by England.  The World Cup is the extent of Quidditch that we get for the book because of something else that is going on at the school.  The Tri-Wizard Championship has returned after a hiatus of centuries (because the fatality rate was far too high).  The Championship is between three magical schools and each school gets one champion.  Nobody under the age of 17 may enter and they will be magically prohibited to enter.  All names will be entered into the Goblet of Fire, which will select the champions.  Cedric Diggory (a Hufflepuff Quidditch player) is the Hogwarts champion.  The other two are selected and the selections should be over....until one more name is spit out: Harry Potter.  While this was against the rules, Dumbledore decided that since the Goblet of Fire spit out Harry's name, Harry must compete.<br />The book follows Harry during the school year as there are attempts on his life and through the Tri-Wizard Championship (made up of three trials spread out throughout the year).  There is quite a bit of action in this book and like the others, it is a book that once I started reading, I didn't want to stop.  There are surprises and sadness and everything in between.  J.K. Rowling writes so well that the characters are believable as people, and even though we know that magic isn't really, we can believe in it for the duration of the book.  With each book that Rowling writes, the Harry Potter series gets better.Harry Potter series gets better.	2003-06-23

I just re-read Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire about a month ago in anticipation for the fifth book (that is now less than two weeks away), and I was reminded of the reasons why the fourth book is my favorite so far in the series.<br />In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry returns for his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There are the same friends, the same enemies, a crush (drama!), plus students and teachers from two other wizarding schools. Everyone's at Hogwarts for the return of the Triwizard Tounament - which is the cause for much more of the danger and excitement in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's fourth year.<br />On the inside flap of the hardcover edition, the book is called the pivotal fourth novel, and for good reason. \\"Goblet of Fire\\" adds another long-term obstacle (I know that that's too weak of a word) to the already-developed plotline of Harry and friends' quest to get through their seven years of school. Almost more than it does anything else, this novel builds anticipation, for now readers have the tiniest glimpse of what lies ahead in years five, six, and seven. For this reader, it seems like seven books will never be enough.<br />The plot of Harry Potter 4 is definately darker than the first three, and this may be part of the reason I thought it was better. J.K. Rowling's plots have always been as good for adults as they are for children, but the new aspects in this installment made the book filled with more emotion, and a few more themes that older audiences might identify with more than the young.<br />If there's anyone out there left who hasn't read this book, don't be intimidated by the size. In this case, more pages just means more fun. Anyway, I have friends (myself included) that were finished on the day that we got it. Don't make any excuses to yourself if you've read the first three but are holding off on this one. Read this book. If there's anyone out there (and I really hope that there isn't) who are thinking about skipping the first three and starting with this one, break the habit of starting series in the middle and go read \\"Sorceror's Stone.\\" It's a terrible habit and I don't know why people do that, but I'm saying it just in case.<br />If you haven't read it yet, enjoy. If you have, go ahead and read it again. For me, at least, it was just as good the second time.hinking about skipping the first three and starting with this one, break the habit of starting series in the middle and go read \\"Sorceror's Stone.\\" It's a terrible habit and I don't know why people do that, but I'm saying it just in case.<br />If you haven't read it yet, enjoy.

I can't possible pick a favorite among the Harry Potter books... My favorite tends to be whichever I am reading at the time.  Still, I've just re-read Goblet (in anticipation of Phoenix) and I am impressed all over again. Rowling has planned and woven in so many tiny details in the earlier books (which, at the time, just seemed to add \\"color\\" to a scene), only to reveal in a later book how each detail is significant.  Also, I thought that the Triwizard Tournament was a great tool, not only for the \\"action,\\" but also because it gave the reader an opportunity to learn more about the background of certain characters who would not otherwise have \\"come up in conversation\\" at Hogwarts.  Again, I'm sure those details will come around again in a more significant light.  Speaking of which... Did anyone else notice that a) The name of the \\"woman with all the cats\\" who used to babysit Harry in the first book was \\"Mrs. Figg\\"... AND b) At the end of Goblet, Dumbledore sends for \\"Arabella Figg.\\"  Rowling doesn't do that sort of thing by accident, and I really enjoy it!	2003-05-25

As a lover of writing and reading, I have appreciated the subtle nuances of Rowling's work. I came to read her series because I thought the movies were very sweet and interesting. Books 1-3 are very enjoyable, and highly entertaining; however, with this fourth book Rowlings out did herself. I must say that this is one of best books I have ever read.<br />I cried, laughed, and was jumping off my couch while reading. The fact that it is simply done enhances the emotional low and highs. JKR's vivid detail is engaging and I couldn't put the book down, literally. I started reading for a bit of fun, and eighteen hours later I was wishing that I had Book 5.<br />Unlike JKR's previous novels, the \\"Goblet of Fire\\" dispenses with a lot of its redundancy (as explained by another reviewer). Here the reader is taken to a very large fork in a road in the world of Witches and Wizards. We are given our greatest insight, and I was astounded and breathless.<br />I won't give away much of the plot, but I will say that everything is not as it seems for Harry. Friendship, loyalty, and conceived notions are threatened for our young friend. Beginning with his ill concealed delight to attend a World Cup Quidditch match with the Weasley's, where young Potter is introduced to the varying world of witchcraft. Yet, Voldemort has more in store for Harry, and characters of old and new faces must choose between understanding, or death. I refuse to give away more. You will have to buy the book and read for yourself.<br />On a separate note, I am twenty-six year old female and lover of literature. I applaud everyone who even attempted to read this book, especially children. I don't understand what all the fuss is about, but pull your head out the sand folks. This is a great book, emphasis on book. It is an imaginary world that is really nothing more then a microcosm of our own. Magik is what gives it the spice of life, but all the more subtle and finer points is what brings it to life. When I have children they will definitely be reading these stories. Matter of fact, I may have to speed up the process so I can get started reading again.<br />Happy Readingchildren they will definitely be reading these stories.

A great series of books to read aloud to your kids (even if they can read it themselves). Don't be surprised to hear them beg you to \\"read on! one more chapter! you can't stop now!\\" Besides you won't mind reading these books yourself (why should the kids have all the fun?). We were all dying to know what will happen next. I guarantee you will have a hard time putting it down. I was glad to see Dobby the House Elf back and wonder who might be returning in book 5? I don't believe some of the subplots are as trivial as some people think and will probably be furthur developed in book 5. This book is a bit darker than the other stories. The ending should probably not be read right before bedtime to younger kids. This book will take some time to get through but it never seems too long. Why do so many people want to cut down a book's pages? Finally book 5 has a release date, June 21st, see you in line!	2003-01-14

However, you must be open minded, and leave behind the fact that many consider this book \\"literature for children only\\". That was my mistake at first, when my younger sister lent them to me. I suppose I was  quite prejudiced: I didn't read them, I skimmed trough the first and decided that they weren't for me.<br />However, after seeing the first movie I realised I might be missing something worthwhile. At the second (but first serious) try, I loved them (so, what does that tell us about prejudices?). Now I've read all Harry Potter's books, and I love them (I'm anxiously waiting for the next one).<br />Anyway, I can tell that this one, \\"Harry Potter and the goblet of fire\\", was the best so far. More action and a deeper development of characters make a wonderful book. It is a little sad, though (one of the characters dies), but at the same time has a lot to teach you about what is important in life: values, friendship.<br />I would recommend this book for everybody, grown-ups (unprejudiced and with imagination, please, don't repeat my mistake) and children. Each one will read this book in her/his own particular way, but all will like it, and keep it. In a word, worthwhile and captivating...	2003-01-10

Christie Meets Agatha Rowling	I've enjoyed each of the four books so far published in this series.  The thing that makes \\"Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire\\" such a wonderful book is that it is a superb mystery.  We really need the final chapters where all of the details of what was going on all along finally come to light.  The action of the book makes it also a superb page-turner.  I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.  The fact that it is set against the backdrop of a world of wizards and witches gives such a unique setting for the mystery to shine.  Rowling's characters are also so wonderfully human from the pompus Bagman to the cool Krum to jealous Ron down to Moaning Myrtle who turns up whenever Harry gets close to a body of water, be it the bathtub or lake!  The final dual between Harry and U-Know-Who is incredibly sustained tension.  Rowling has done a wonderful job like Agatha Christie at winding the mechanism of the mystery up so tightly we wince and then letting it spin out facts to explain the mystery as Dumbledore patiently listens to Harry's account of the duel.  This is an exquisite thriller.  The lessons of loyalty, friendship, and focusing on the truth are superb lessons that resonate with children and adults alike.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter series is becoming more and more difficult (because everything has already been said thousands of times)!  Trying to give a unique review is also becoming harder and harder.  This is another absolutely stupendous book and I really loved reading it.<br /> Harry has returned to Hogwarts for his fourth year after a fun visit with the Weasleys and a terrifying experience at the World Cup (marking the return of the death eaters).  Quidditch is not being played this year--in its place is a rigorous competition known as Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Only one contestant is selected from each of three wizarding schools with the stipulation being that the student must be seventeen.  Unsurprisingly, fourteen year-old Harry's name is also pulled out of the \\"Goblet of Fire.\\"  Thus begins his solitary voyage.  With a few exceptions, Harry must make this journey alone through much of this novel.  He even becomes estranged from his best friend, Ron (Hermione does remain close to Harry).  The other students make fun of him and even ignore him. The cruelty of the Slytherins is the nastiest.  Many of the things that Harry goes through are the same as what most teens must endure as part of the growing up process.  Unfortunately, Harry does not have the benefit of loving parents to give him some must needed support so he turns to his godfather, his friends, and even a few professors.  This book is much darker and sadder than the first three books but as in the others, the writing is so beautiful that you will feel Harry's pain.  As always, Harry triumphs in the end but even this conclusion is bittersweet.	2002-12-29

Upon hearing that Goblet of Fire was over 700 pages long, many people exclaimed that children would not read it.  It's too long, they said.  But read it they have.  Perhaps because it was no different than reading two of the first three books.  Whatever the reason, volume 4 in the Harry Potter series is as much of a page turner as the preceding 3.<br />This tale opens, as usual, with the bane of Harry's existence:  the Riddle house.  It moves to the Quidditch World Cup where ominous events occur, then as is usual, to Hogwarts.  Just when the reader is ready to settle into the familiar world of witch and wizard schooling, Rowling disrupts everything with the Triwizard Tournament.  Thus, enter a host of new characters and new information on what it means to be a wizard.<br />By far the darkest of the series, Goblet of Fire moves the story of Harry's growing up and education along.  And at 14, the normal human side of him is maturing, too.  Along with the fantasy elements, coming of age, and traditional English school boy story line, a new element has been added:  young romance.<br />Some readers may be put off by the darkness of this installment of the Harry Potter saga.  Others might find the book over long; some more detailed editing would have solved that.  Still, this is a satisfying continuation of the saga.  The book also continues the wonderful task of getting America's young people to read.  There are so many books out there that children and young adults might enjoy, such as \\"Storm Warriors\\" by Elisa Carbone, and the Catwings stories by Ursula LeGuin.	2002-12-05

It is extremely dark and provides an adventure with more history and information about the magical world and the meaining of good vs. evil.<br />PLOT SUMMARY: Fourteen-year-olds Harry, Ron, and Hermione are excited when Arthur Weasley gets prime seating tickets to the International Quidditch World Cup. After their exciting and intense trip to the Cup, they return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their fourth year. Harry is excited about competiting in Quidditch for the House Cup, but is disappointed when he learns Quidditch has been canceled, due to the international school Triwizard Tournament competition, that involves three magical schools competiting against each other in magical and dangerous tasks. There are three Champions and the winner receives the Triwizard Tournament trophy and one thousand galleons. You must be at least seventeen years old to compete, so Harry thinks he doesn't have a chance. But when his name is mysteriously picked from the Goblet of Fire which reveals who the Champions from the three schools will be, Harry has no choice but to compete...even though there is already another Hogwarts Champion. Now with the help of Ron and Hermione, it's up to Harry to complete the three tasks without making himself look like a complete fool in front of everyone. Little does he know that this is all just a set up to bring back one of the darkest Lords in the history of magic...<br />OVERALL THOUGHTS: I've read all four Harry Potter books to-date and this is definitely the best one yet. It is full of suspense and complex twists/plots. There is still some of JK Rowling's witty, original sense of humor but since \\"Goblet of Fire\\" is more dark, there is less and this is a more serious novel. It is very intense and dark, the climax is pretty frightening for young children...so parents beware: you might want to read this with your very young children or wait until they are a little older to be able to understand everything.<br />If this is what \\"Goblet of Fire\\" is like, I can only hope for better with \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\".

This, as you may know, is the fourth installment from PK Rowling and, as you have come to expect/fear, it captures her mystical sense of \\"hay-laiden fantasy/comedy.\\"  The Goblet of Fire is much more violent and racy (no, not rascist) than the others in the series.  Here young Harold is forced to steal back the Goblet of Fire from Yoric and regain his champion-like status of the broom-game thing.  His buddening sexuality makes this the most exciting and awkward of the Harold Potter series.  Harry is torn between his \\"traditionally natural\\" love and attraction toward Hermione (pronounced Her-Me-Own), meanwhile his innards lustfully drive him towards that blonde dude.  The ending is the same as the other stories, but the revolutionary aspect of this the IV in the series is that the beginning casts off the shackles of traditional prose and is comprised mostly of fart jokes.

In my opinion this is not a good book for kids. The things that you have to go through the book and specially the end are really scary, shocking and dark.<br />With the people that wrote that J.K Rowling is getting out of track with this book are wrong in my opinion. She is writting the story of a boy growing in a magical environment and facing death while he grows. Of course the first books are going to be lighter to read, even thought they have some darkness, but is understandable that she is going to continuing adding dangers in the following books.<br />J.K Rowling, in my opinion is a genius of the writing.

For readers who thought that Harry had grown a lot in the third book, the fourth book shows even more how much he is maturing and growing up. Harry still finds that there is a lot about the wizarding world that he doesn't know, but he is learning and growing every day.<br />In the fourth book, Harry gets his chance to see a professional Quidditch game for the first time--at the Quidditch World Cup! The Weasleys have invited him to go with them, which also means that Harry gets to leave the Dursleys sooner than he had expected. Harry loves watching the professional teams and seeing so many wizards and witches in one place together, but two things upset the end of the night for everyone: a group of Death Eaters appear, followers of Voldemort, and Voldemort's Dark Mark is conjured in the sky--by Harry's wand, which he had lost sometime during the night.<br />Despite the appearances of these things, Harry's return to Hogwarts is filled with excitement when the students learn of what will be coming up during the year at their school. Harry soon finds himself wrapped up in the events, though he is below the required age limit.<br />Sirius is convinced that someone is after Harry and put his name into the drawing themselves. With all of the foreign students, teachers, ministry members, and reporters running around Hogwarts, Harry can't figure out who may be trying to get him killed.

Voldemort returns and Harry faces a battle with him, meeting the ghosts of his parents during the events.<br />This book always leaves me crying at the end.

However, the Goblet of Fire sets a new tone: darker, more dangerous-and better. Maybe I just like dark tones, or... Yeah, that's probably it. However, I don't think that's all. It's also longer then prior books clocking in at more then 700 pages; I read it in one day. It's just that good. It's nice to see a book mature with you; (by comparison, the Redwall series, if anything, is lighter then when it started).

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is(so far) the best Harry Potter novel.  It follows Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  The story starts of in \\"Little Hangleton\\".  The villagers who live there called the Little abandoned house on the Hill the Riddle house, even though the The villagers havd moved there fifty years ago.  The novel like the others are mysterious, scary, heroic, and magical just like the others.  And as the others Rowling has athe same charm to whisk you out of the muggle world and into the wonderous world of Hogwarts School of Witch Craft and Wizardry.  The novel also introduces new chracters to the Harry Potter univere such as John Riddle, Cho-Chang etc.  So if you want to be whisked to a world of magic than I reccomend you read the Harry Potter series.  J.K Rowling is a very gifted young writer, and this novel proves it.  ENJOY!!!!!!<br />  ~Dan~	2002-10-01

I am so happy that for once a super popular book is actually something that is well written and not an insult to the intelligence and one's aesthetic sensability. Thank God something clicked in people's heads that they are willing to explore and challenge themselves a little bit more beyond stupid love stories and pointless and poorly written action/adventure books. This 4th book has definitely many things that deserve the greatest compliments as you can surely see in probably all reviews. The most intelligent scenario Rowling has conceived so far in these 4 books in my opinion is when Harry is under his invisibility cloak trapped in the stairs in front of Snape and Filch and Moody helps him and finds out about the marauders map. Only close to the end of the book you realize why this moment when Moody is looking at the map in front of Harry was such a critical one, what was at stake, what was really going on there. No doubt fascinating imagination and lessons Rowling has displayed and shared in these Harry Potter books. Thanks for that.<br />I spent a waste of time reading one, two, or occacationally three star reviews. Not one of them said something that is realistic or supportive of what they try to say. Those are some most common one star reviewers reason(s):<br /><br />1. Harry has no depth (as well as other charaters).<br />- They are very rich in personality. Snape flexing his hands every time he looks at Harry as if wanting to strangle him is an example.<br />2. It is predictable.<br />- WARNING DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK Can these people honestly say they knew or suspected Crouch's son was alive??? Of course not! He died after being in prison for a year. Can people say they knew Snape and Karkaroff are death eaters??? Of course not! By the way I don't think Karkaroff is going to live to see 2 more Christmas.<br />3. It is boring<br />- I still can't understand how it is boring. After the end each chapter, I my first instinct is to continue to the next chapter. (I've read a lot of books to know what IS boring)<br />4. Too long (724 pages hardcover)<br />- I agree that some of the plot is unnecessary, but almost every events (about 85%) of the story is important to later conclusion or may cause laugher. Some reviewers' state that (SPOILER AHEAD) cedrics death is unnecessary, but he might just be important in book 5(as a ghost?).<br />5.  Violent<br />-There are some violent in this book, but most of them is to show how evil is Voldemort. The age range 9-12 is too low however, I'd rate it 12-120.<br />6.Harry lies<br />-Yes, Harry does lies, but only if the truth would slow down their investigation, or hurt, disappoint, and terrified the person been lied to. Like Professor Dumbledore's statement:<br />\\"The truth\\" he sighed. \\"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and therefore be treated with great caution...\\"(from Book one)<br />7. Some so-called Christian stated that it promote Occult, Wicca (modern witchcraft), and Pagan.<br />-As endless 5 stars reviewer repeat again, again, again, and again that Harry Potter book does not promote Occult, Wicca, and Pagan. These books are not evil, they do not promote evil, and they do not glorify evil. On the contrary, they glorify self-sacrifice, dedication and honesty to friends, honesty in the face of evil, courage in the face of evil, and most importantly, these books show children (and adults) how to face our fears with bravery. We can learn a lot from little Harry Potter, and I find it a shame that so-called Christians have decided to wage some kind of bizarre illiterate crusade against these books. Almost All incantations in made out of Latin like lumos (light Charm)=light.<br />I enjoyed this book and hope I can meet someone who does not like this book so I can see if they can support themselves.  Pardon if I have any spelling or grammar errors.

I am a few years up from the target age level for this book, but still picked up a copy and was just as impressed and gripped by the skill behind this book as I was for the first three books.  This book is another gem from Rowling, who managed to diplace my fears that this book would have another happy ending. She manages to keep all of the elements of Harry's magical world that we all love so much, and add to it, by giving us more glimpses of the wizarding world outside of England with the Quidditch World Cup, and even added specialized moves and terms in the game itself. She proved herself equal to the task of addressing the serious issue of the death of a student, and the rise of everyones' greatest fear, without making the plot seem melodramatic or silly. She is in addition to that teaching a serious lesson at the end about putting aside prejudgices and all that good stuff like she normally does. Not to mention she has challenged her readers to accept the fact that even a fourteen year old wizard can have dark times in his life. Good luck to her on the fifth, and better luck to those who insist on making movies out of the books.	2002-09-23

But the summer is fun, including the Quidditch World Cup.<br />Rowling continues her saga of being able to completely capture her audience with this book.  I was completely absorbed, at times on the edge of my seat.<br />In the tradition of the last three books, there is a satisfying twist in the ending of this book.  The second is still my favorite of the series, but this one loses no charm.  However, the series is taking a steady dark spiral.  (You'd have to read it to understand, there is no way I'm giving away what happens)  The last few chapters, for lack of a better way to say it, creeped me out.  Rowling is such a masterful story teller I was right there with Harry through an incredibly harrowing experience, one that I would not like to envision again.  The story is great, and it left me excited for the fifth book.  Once again there are new characters introduced that are eccentric enough to be real, but magically out of the ordinary enough to be completely unbelieveable.  Of course, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher once again steals this role in the novel.<br /> I can't wait to see where this story gets taken.  In the hands of this capable writer, I am extremely excited to see what will happen as Harry Potter grows into the wizard he will become.	2002-08-21

As the titular character grows older, so to do the stories become darker.  Many people complained about the way this book was written, and about it's surprisingly violent (surprisingly, not excessively) finale.  However, for the story to progress as a whole, it must happen.  After all, how scary is a villain that never causes any actual damage?  I don't want to give away much of the story but I'd like to point out some things I find interesting.  First, it's amazing to me how realistically Miss Rowling handled the distresses of asking a girl on a date.  When Harry and Ron have to find partners for the dance, they have a sufficiently difficult time at it.  One thing I know, being a bit of a social misfit, is that the opposite sex is very perplexing.  Also, a key theme of the Goblet of Fire seems to be paternal relationships.  Dumbledore to Harry, Harry's Godfather (I'm not saying his name) to Harry, Crouch to his son, Voldemort to his most loyal Death Eater, Voldemort to Wormtail, Arthur Weasley to his sons, Crouch to Percy (to a lesser extent), Mr. Diggory to Cedric, also Malfoy's Crabbe's and Goyle's fathers all make an appearance. Family is a strong theme in this particular book, and makes for some particularly poignant scenes. Maybe I'm strectching there, but it seems a strong theme.  I was moved by this book, genuinely moved.  As for those who attack adult fans of the Harry Potter books, for what it's worth I am an english major in college.  I understand that Harry Potter isn't Faulkner or Heller (two personal favorites), but it's not supposed to be.  Harry Potter is a fun story, meant to entertain, not necessarily to enlighten.  I suggest some people try lightening up, be happy kids are reading, and revel in the fact that in a world that can sometimes be all too dark, people can find something to enjoy.  After all, if you can't enjoy life, what's the point.  Really... What Else Is There?	2002-07-31

I have read all four Harry Potter books. This one is for certain not as good, overall, as books 1 and 2. Maybe it's only me, but I could have sworn I was not reading the real J.K. Rowling. There seems to be a few different styles of writing imitating her style in this book, a few different \\"ghost writers\\" (no pun intended). And, although there are about 200 pages that held my attention, the rest of the 700 some odd pages were boring at times.

Still, I am looking forward to see what they come up with next in book 5. While I'm waiting, I read another book about a Harry which is not stories of magic, witchcraft, and wizardry, but true, real-life stories from civilization's past presented within the framework of a fantasy. So, if like me you like fantasies, while we're waiting to see what \\"Harry Potter\\" gets into next, you'll probably want to read \\"West Point: Character Leadership....\\" by Norman Thomas Remick.

It is exciting, and brings the characters to a new level.  Although it is over seven hundred pages long, it is a fast read.  The length is needed because there is so much more going on in the characters lives.  You won't want to put the book down. It took me about four days to read for that very reason, and I am a slow reader.<br />  I loved this book and I would recommend to people of all ages, but be sure to have read the other three books or you won't understand some parts.	2002-07-17

What I've enjoyed most about Rowling's Potter series is the cozy feeling I get reading them--like sitting in an English pub on a chilly evening, there's this warm camraderie between Harry and his friends, a sense of security at Hogwarts, with its rules and traditions and authority figures that somehow survive the tweaking that its resident scholars inflict, and heart-of-gold characters like Hagrid and Dumbledore and Mrs. Weasley warm you on the inside like steaming bowls of Mulligatawny.<br />But now Harry's 14, old enough to be initiated into evil rites, snatched from the safety of a school game to a life-and-death struggle in a graveyard. The stakes are no longer a Quidditch championship, but world domination by the powers of darkness, and one student even dies in the contest. In light of the events of 9/11/01, perhaps American readers are more sensitive to the \\"change in the weather\\" that Potter and his peers are bracing for at the end of \\"Goblet of Fire.\\" I find myself awaiting Vol. 5--like tomorrow's headlines--with some rrepidation.	2002-06-27

Harry Potter is growing up, and the danger that he faces is as sinister as it is real.

The plot twists will keep you guessing (and as usual, your guesses as to who the villian is will be wrong) as you learn more about Harry's past (and the past of others - such as Dumbledore and Snape for example.)  Yet  there is a darkness to this book, which may be off-setting to some.  There are stormclouds gathering on the horizon, and trouble is afoot.

When the Harry Potter series first came out I was like \\"Pssht what idiocy!\\" (I was 7 at the time so it was more like \\"that's stupid\\") They didn't appeal to me at all, even when my friends started reading them. It was around 1999-2000 when I actually started to read them. My friend, who had all 4 books at the time, told me I had to read them and they were hard to put down, so (with a very skeptical mind) I started Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. Let me tell you, at first I thought she was WROONNNGGGG. I began the book and got to about chapter 3 when I decided I didn't want to read it anymore, so I stashed it under my bed. After my friend kept saying, \\"Are you done YET????\\" I finally decided to finish the book so I could give it back to her, plus my other friend, Stephanie, told me it got more interesting around the middle. So, I began reading, and found out that Stephanie was smarter than I thought. I read the book and immediately afterwards I ran to my friends house and borrowed the second.. and the third.. after I had finished the third my 3 best friends, Kayla,the one who lent me the books; Stephanie; and Julia, told me the 4th was the best. I quickly borrowed the fourth and devoured the book in a matter of 3 days. I LOVED IT. To me, it WAS the absolute BEST of the 4. Then, after getting bored waiting for the 5th book I read the whole series again... and when I got to the fourth.. well, let's just say my new favorites are the 2nd and 3rd. I still love the whole series, of course, but I think when you read the 4th book the 2nd time it loses it's appeal (namely because the first time you read it it's new and exciting, but the second time you know every single detail.) All in all, I rate this book a 5. It's awesome, and you should all go out and read the series.	2002-06-21

I've read all the Harry Potter books in order and I have to say that \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" is probably the best by far. I'm sure books five, six, and seven will be even better than this one...but out of all the books that are available right now, this one is it. \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" has a very dark twist to it, and it's about 734 pages long! But it only took me about three days to read it...THAT'S how good it was!<br />In \\"Goblet of Fire\\", our boy wizard hero, Harry Potter, is 14 years old. Not only is he going through puberty, but he's also discovering that maybe girls aren't as bad as he thought they were...and has got his eyes on one particular Hogwarts student known as Cho Chang. Before going back to Hogwarts though, Harry is invited to go to the Quidditch World Cup game with Ron Weasley and his family. Since Harry's never had the chance to go to one, he manages to get his Uncle Vernon, to let him go...this means that his uncle, aunt, and cousin won't have to deal with him for the rest of the summer. After some strange encounters at the Quidditch World Cup camp site where Harry and the Weasleys are staying at, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all go back to Hogwarts for another school year. The new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher is a mysterious, grouchy wizard called \\"Mad-Eye\\" Moody, who seems to have a likeing in Harry since he's always trying to protect him and help him out. On the first day back at Hogwarts, Professor Dumbledore makes an announcement that the Quidditch games will be canceled this year because of the Triwizard Tournament. There are three competiters, called champions, in the tournament, and they all have to be at least seventeen years old to compete. In this compilcated competition, the champions have to use their skills and strengths and wands to defeat really dangerous tasks...the winner earns a huge trophy and 1,000 Galleons. For some reason, when it is time to choose the three champions from each of the three schools, a fourth name--Harry Potter's--is picked from the Goblet of fire! Harry knows that he did not put his name in the Goblet, but since his name was chosen, he has to compete. Now it's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, to find out who put Harry's name in the Goblet...and also to help him to get through the competition. Also, there is a Yule Ball taken place at Hogwarts for all three schools to attend. Harry tries asking Cho to the dance, but she is already going with Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion who is seventeen, handsome, smart, and popular. So Harry gets really crushed, but ends up going with someone else because all the champions have to find dance partners to start off the ball.<br />Like I said before, this book is probably the darkest one of them all. Also, trying not to spoil anything, one of the champions dies while competiting in the tournament...I'm not gonna tell you who or how it happens! And Harry has another encounter with Lord Voldemort--this time it's more deadly. Plus, Sirius Black (if you don't remember from \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\", Black is Harry's godfather and his father's best friend) returns! I'd have to say that so far, the \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" are the two lightest stories. \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and \\"Goblet of Fire\\" are the darkest ones. If you like fantasy novels with dark twists, then I highly recomment \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\"...but make sure you read the other Harry Potter books first so you know what's going on. I'm just dying to read \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix\\"...another job well done, J.K. Rowling!

Plus, Sirius Black (if you don't remember from \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\", Black is Harry's godfather and his father's best friend) returns! I'd have to say that so far, the \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" are the two lightest stories. \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and \\"Goblet of Fire\\" are the darkest ones. If you like fantasy novels with dark twists, then I highly recomment \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\"...but make sure you read the other Harry Potter books first so you know what's going on. I'm just dying to read \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix\\"...another job well done, J.K. Rowling! And please try to hurry it up with the fifth novel!<br />Final Grade: A+	2002-06-20

While other commenters have noted some inconsistencies and deficiencies, it is easy to gloss over these.  Readers who allow themselves to be transported to Ms. Rowling's Wizarding world will barely notice the inconsistencies and enjoy the world revealed by the author's pen.  Afterall, if one were to get to nitpiky - would we even believe in wizards, witches, flying brooms, hippogriffs, veelas and lepuracans?  Although I will agree with a prior reviewer in that Ms. Rowling could easily have cut 100 pages or more - or should I say her editor should have done so.<br />In her prior books, JK Rowling concentrated on introducing us to Harry, Wizarding, and Hogwarts (Book 1), expanding upon the Hogwart's world (Book 2), and delving into Harry and his family even more (Book 3).  All of these focused on certain aspects of Harry's world and establish the basis for the fourth book where the whole of the wizarding world is laid open to us.  True to serial book fashion, Book 4 also sets up Book 5 - which will surely be interesting!	2002-06-19

However I just finished #4 and I must be honest. I found this book subpar with the others, the story meandered and was a tad slow. I thought that J.K.R was having trouble coming up with a story and decided to spew forth an edition that could have been shortened by about 200 pages. Now I love to read fluff books as much as the next guy however, I was finding this book too long for all intents and purposes. I mean can you watch a 3 hour movie of the Power puff girls before you say, \\"jeez this is a tad long.\\" Remember, J.K. think of the little kids who are reading this book. I just hope she didn't get paid by the page? Well it's only a theory.	2002-06-17

Without giving away the plot, there is no reason for the portkey at the end of the novel to be the object it is.  The whole plot hangs on this.  The bad guy could much more easily made something else the port key as soon as Harry gets back to Hogwarts and with a lot less fuss.<br />Because there is need for the port key to be the item in question, the verisimilitude of the novel crashes and burns.  I was especially disappointed because up until this point, I thought plotting was Rowling's greatest strength.  She sure blew it in book four.<br />Also, Harry drops the Marauder's Map when his leg is in the stair.  Fine. He tries to reach it.  Fine. But why doesn't he just say \\"Accio, Map!\\" just like he did the Firebolt, eh?  We know he knows that spell cold.  And after all, he uses that command to great effect in the climax.  Why not use it here? Couldn't think of any other way for Mad Eye Moody to get the map, J.K?  Tsk tsk.<br />wem	2002-06-16

Rowling has hit another home run with her fourth instalment of the Muggle confined wizard Harry Potter in \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\\" In this book, our young hero is 14 years old and on his way back to Hogwarts School of Withcraft and Wizardry to the great company of his two best friends Hermione Granger (played by Emma Watson in the movie) and Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint). But before anything that might be construed as boring and anything that will cause learing in our heros, they must first go the biggest sporting event in the wizarding world: The Quidditch World Cup. Dark things are going down right at that time though, which everybody except the villian Lord Voldemort and his faithfull servent Peter \\"Wormtail\\" Pettigrew are not knowing of.<br />This book as everything that a loyal Potter fan and even somebody who hasn't read one can enjoy: adelescent angst at the schools Yule Ball, a sleazy reporter and magic up the wazzoo. Making a very welll plased return in this book as Harry's godfather is Sirius Black who made his debut in the third book, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\\"<br />The tone and tempo of the series so far has gone flawlessly. The first book is very inoccent and fancyfree, the second one dwells deeper into the darker portions of the characters lives, the third one steps outside of Hogworts and the fourth one takes all three of the themes and crams them together. Most people that I have talked to have said that it is too long, but I think that is what makes it great; the things that happen can't be contained in a 350 page book. The end will make you feel like your watching a reunion on a TV show and waiting to see the rest of the cast join the main character. Mentioned in the essential hospital scene is none other than former Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin and a name that you might recognize: Arabella Figg.<br />What makes the Harry Potter series much more entertaining than the Lord of the Rings trilogy is that Harry and his friends do more than wonder around and look for a magic ring and actually interact and participate in things that are fun, but also be in periliss danger.<br />Althought this book is much darker (The Death Eaters) it still has a sense of goodness in it that manifests itself perfectly in his godfathers extreme loyalty to Harry. \\"Goblet\\" is the Wizard of Oz of our time and is not only a childrens fantasy novel but also a great detective story and such a fast read that you will want to read it again and again and again.riends do more than wonder around and look for a magic ring and actually interact and participate in things that are fun, but also be in periliss danger.<br />Althought this book is much darker (The Death Eaters) it still has a sense of goodness in it that manifests itself perfectly in his godfathers extreme loyalty to Harry. \\"Goblet\\" is the Wizard of Oz of our time and is not only a childrens fantasy novel but also a great detective story and such a fast read that you will want to read it again and again and again.	2002-06-16

I have read all 4 years of Harry's Hogwarts experience now and I have to admit that this was my least favorite of the 4 books. It's not that the book wasn't entertaining - Ms. Rowling certainly wove an intriguing tale . It's just that I think she could have eliminated at least 100 pages, perhaps more. She seemed to take a wordy Dickensian detour, adding too much extraneous information in certain parts. This should not discourage Hary Potter fans who have not yet read Book 4 - Year 4 is very important in young Harry's life and after muddling through the extraneous, you'll find this a must read!<br />In any case, the rise of Lord Voldemort and the consequent discussion of good vs. evil comes at a time when the events of September 11th have forced society to examine these issues as they pertain to our own lives. The dark note on which this book ended makes me nervously anticipate Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts.<br />Keep writing, Ms. Rowling - the books are so much more important than the movies (and better too!)	2002-06-13

This is another volume in an outstanding, deeply satisfying series; but I wonder if the author may be starting to run out of steam.  While volume four is very good, the underlying plot structure, Rowling must know, needs to change.  The formula so far has been that Harry meets the challenge of dealing with Lord Voldemort; and, along the way, he engages with some he trusted who turn out to betray him, and there are other \\"surprises,\\" now coming to be somewhat expected.  Rowling has excellent instincts as a writer, so I suspect that the delay of volume five is due to her desire and effort not to cash in on her success in a formulaic way but to come up with another book that will not only take Harry to a higher level of maturity, ethical insight, wizardry skills, and romance but also reflect her own growing maturity as a novelist.	2002-06-04

In Harry Potter's fourth and most daring adventure \\"The Goblet of Fire\\", J.K. Rowling leads us in a suspensefull journey that leaves us guessing. Harry Potter, now a much more mature 14 year-old, has his most deep and violent encounters, confrontations with his friends, and his first crush. This is by far my most favorite year at Hogwarts, so far. I love the way Harry has the competitions, the ball, and his crush on Cho Chang. It seems, at last, that Harry might have some real-life \\"muggle\\" problems, but of course he handles them in a way only a wizard could. The novel starts with all these events, starting off light-hearted and leaving us with excitement for the adentures to come. Little did we know, that the characters would take a turn for the worst. Harry undergoes dangerous tasks, nightmares that leave his scar hurting, and an encounter with his deadly nemesis. This is by far the most deep and violent confrontation with his arch-enemy, Voldemort, resulting in the death of a classmate and the unvailing of the Death Eaters. It also uncovers the underground secrets of the Ministry of Magic and the true pasts of faculty members and high members of the Ministry. I most enjoy Rowling's use of foreshadowing to tie all these events together and give us clues to what just might happen. Foreshadowng is the use of events and symbols in order to give us a preiew on what is next to come. Rowling uses this literary device most diligantly. For example, when Winky, Mr. Crouche's house elf, saves a seat for him at the Quidditch World Cup. Crouch's failure to show up and the mystery of where he was and why he wasn't there foreshadows Mr. Crouch's dissapearence later on and Winky's role in it. Another example is Harry's dream about the snake. This foreshadows Voldemorts use of the snake in his encounter with Harry. I most enjoy Rowling's use foreshadowing, mostly because it gives a glimpse into the ending and the dangerous events to come. I think Rowling's use of this literary device strengthens the novels story-line and is employed well. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I hope, is not the best we'll see from J.K Rowling, but is right up there in the top, oh I don't know, three. I thorougly enjoyed this book and I would definantly reccomend it anyone who loves a fairytale with heart.

After attending the Quidditch World Cup with his friends, Harry returns to Hogwarts and learns that an interscholastic tournament that has been banned for centuries will be started up again, with Hogwarts hosting.  Each school will have a champion selected by the Goblet of Fire, which will choose the most worthy student from each school.  However, something goes wrong, and it chooses four students instead of three, the fourth being Harry.  Bound by magical code to stay in the tournament, Harry is forced to take on challenges that are deemed to difficult for anyone under a sixth year in school.  Things are going well until the last event, when something unexpected happens, and Harry witnesses one of the most horrible things imanginable...

Rowling<br /> Harry, Ron, and Hermione are at it again in the fourth book of the series. Harry lives with the Dursleys on Private Drive in the Muggle world. A muggle is  a wizard word for non-wizard. One lucky day he gets a letter from Ron inviting him to stay with them and go to the Quiditch World Cup. This is the chance of a life time as Harry is a great fan of quiditch and is on the Hogwarts team. He accepts the offer graciously and goes to the Cup. He has the time of a life time but suddenly while he is there, there's a giant demonstration of Death Eaters(followers of the evil wizard Voldmort) that gets nasty. He runs into the woods as to shelter himself from getting hurt when the Dark Mark appears in the sky. This could only mean one thing. Voldmort is back!<br />After the Cup with much very much excitement it's time to go back to Hogwarts. When he gets there everyone seems to be talking about something very special that would be taking place this year. He tries to investigate further but no one who knows will tell him what it is. All he knows is that the Quiditch team will not be taking place this year. How could they! To be taking away Harry's quiditch the surprise better be very ,very good. When it is time to find put what the surprise is, he is introduced to the Goblet of Fire. It is a magic goblet that can see who is most worthy of the special event. Finally the surprise is unveiled. It is a Triwizard Tournament!<br />The tiwizard tournament  is where a wizard from each school a representative competes for their schools reputation. But what? Harry  cant enter the tournament? It is only for people older then him! Now what's he going to do. This is very disappointing as the winner would receive 1000 galleons prize money(that would be about five- thousand-ten-thousand dollars )! When it is time to hear who is representing Hogwarts, as disappointed as Harry is something very unexpected happened. Even though there's only supposed to be one representative from each school two were chosen for Hogwarts and Harry is one of them! People have died in this but is death worth the risk for the money? Well he has no choice but to compete in this Tournament for his school What will happen? Will he come out safe? Is there anything Ron or Hermione can do to help? You will keep guessing and guessing in this mistery/adventure book who is the bad guy? Who did that? I can recommend that anyone from child to adult will enjoy reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, by J.K Rowling.e's only supposed to be one representative from each school two were chosen for Hogwarts and Harry is one of them!

It started a bit slow but shortly I got sucked into what was going on in the story. Harry goes through many situations that really keep you guessing what will happen next, such as living with his neglecting aunt and uncle in the beginning of the book, or taking part in the Triwizards Tournament. The not knowing what to expect next keeps, you wanting more, and makes it hard to put the book down. I thought the book was really well written, and was fun to read, because you did not have to know anything about the events in the story. You learn about new things as you go along, which keeps it interesting.

Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire<br />J.K. Rowling, who transformed a TV generation into book lovers, continues to create magic in her fourth novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Her series about a boy at odds with himself, his family and his entire world until he discovers that he is a magical wizard speaks volumes on what it means to feel like an outsider and at long last find love and acceptance.<br />In Rowling's earlier novels, Harry begins to understand his powers through a series of adventures that teach him to trust his friends, question authority and most importantly, believe in himself.<br />This tale is as old as time, but Rowling stretches the moral play to a new elevation, as evidenced by the book's dedication:<br /> \\"...to Susan Sladden,<br /> who helped Harry out of his cupboard.\\"<br />Granted, Harry's adoptive parents forced him to sleep in an old cupboard, but it is a rather simple step to take this meaning less literally.  Nowadays, \\"Coming out of the closet\\" means more than an announcement of one's sexuality - it refers to taking pride in those aspects of your character that others would have you deny, either out of discomfort, denial or the desire to not be different.  Rowling uses Harry's position as an outsider in the Muggle (non-magic) world to depict what it feels like in the real world when you are made to feel different, and follows Harry through a process of accepting his differences. This is a valuable lesson for Muggles of any age.<br />Rowling refuses to force Harry to fit into a mold.  In The Goblet of Fire, Harry and several other witches and wizards are forced to rescue the person they will \\"sorely miss.\\" For Harry, this is Ron, his best friend. But even as magic has decided that Harry will miss Ron most, Harry realizes that deciding whom to save, and therefore have in his life, is not that simple.<br />That Rowling likes to toy with conventions is evident.  From her real-life rags to riches story to a strikingly feminist subplot that has characters questioning whether house-elves (who cook and clean) should be paid, Rowling refuses to let things slide simply because they are expected.<br />The same is true with Harry.  How easy it would have been to have Harry transition to the world of magic and live there in bliss.  But this would not be true or real.  In Harry's adventures, his greatest adversaries are from the magic world, from his own feelings of self-doubt and from the people he is expected to trust.<br />Rowling has opened new doors throughout her Harry Potter series, and this fourth installment is no different.  Rowling may be \\"just a children's author\\", but she has demonstrated once again that the lessons we learn as children about acceptance, tolerance and taking on new challenges shape who we are. Harry's life is difficult, especially after he learns who he is, but what makes Harry's life so rich is his ability to transcend the evil forces in his world and life live to the fullest.  For children and adults, this is something we struggle with daily - to not give in to life's challenges.

Through out the book there is always a little excitement and adventure in each chapter. The reason why I read this book was my brother said that this book was really good. So one day when I was board I started to read this book. It was grabbing my attention when I first read the chapter. I couldn't put the book down.<br />The book was about Harry Potter and how he got his name into the goblet of fire. The triwizards tournament was held at Hogwarts and Harry was chosen to be one of the four champions. The triwizards tournament there is a series of three tasks or quests you have to do. During the last task Harry and another champion from hogwarts meet at the end of the task and was going to touch the triwizard trophy together. Harry didn't want to take the trophy so he told the other champion to take it. The other champion didn't want to because he thought Harry deserved it so they both touched it at the same time. When they touched it they were teleported to Lord Voltemort!<br />My favorite part of the book was in the beginning where they went to the Quidditch World Cup. That was my favorite part because I like all kinds of sports. Harry and his friends went to the actual stadium and watched the world cup. That was the most interesting part to me.	2002-03-25

Other characters who are supposedly 'good,' such as Mr. Weasley, the father of Harry's friend, Ron, also lie and, in fact, Mr. Weasley advises his two sons to not tell their mother that they gambled. The story starts with a murder, and a very gruesome and repulsive ritual is performed towards the end of the book. The book also presents the idea that the ends justify the means. I read all four books and carefully documented many moral problems in the main characters that cause these books to be highly inappropriate for children ages 9-12. Additionally, as a former astrologer, I think it is important for people to know of the book's endorsement of the study and use of occult arts such as casting spells and divination. Harry is not learning to be a witch; he is learning to master forces that are the domain of a would-be sorcerer.	2002-03-25

Rowling can manage to make this book before than the ones before.  And at the end of each book, I can once again say yes!<br />In the fourth book of the Harry Potter series, Harry starts his forth year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Before going to school Harry goes to his first professional Quidditch match with his best friend Ron Weasley and his family, but things go terribly wrong after the match leaving everyone to wonder if evil Lord Voldemort will rise again.  As if that's not enough excitement for young Harry Potter, he suddenly finds himself in the middle of the dangerous Tri-Wizards Tournament where it takes everything a wizard know about magic to succeed...or stay alive.  I could say more, but that will ruin the fun.<br />As usual, this fourth installment of the Harry Potter book is excellently written with more and more intricately woven plots than in the previous books.  The plot twists and turns are just as complicated as ever, but Rowling's clear narrative leads us through them cleanly.  The book is also longer, at 700+ pages.  I suspect that some parents will object to some of the darker plot lines in the book (mainly centered around death and murder) and there were a few naughty words here and there (specificially the word \\"damn\\").  The ending was quite a shock, even for me an adult fan, but I also felt that it was necessary for it to end that way.  The Goblet of Fire is the first book in the series in which you get a real inkling of how frightening and evil Lord Voldemort really is, and I suspect that things will only get darker for Harry in books to come.  We're not dealing with the half smart/half stupid evil character that shows up in many children's books.  So be prepared!  As for appropriateness for children, I for one don't really believe in hiding the facts of life from kids and I would have no problem with them reading it, although depending on their age, I might prefer to read it to them instead of having them read it on their own.  There are some things in the book that can be scary to young children.  However, I'm sure that not all parents will feel that way, so I would advise parents who are sensitive to subjects such as death and curse words to read it first before allowing their children to read it.eir age, I might prefer to read it to them instead of having them read it on their own.

This book is still focused mainly on the three characters of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  IT is also still full of the antics of the Weasely twins and family.

This book is simply not meant for younger readers.<br />I found it thoroughly entertaining, but in need of better editing.  Some of the story lines simply do not blend well and this book is starting to show some amateur quality.  It is well worth the read because we all want to keep up with the threesome!

Rowling, is book four in the four book series. I recently read this story, and I thought that it was an incredible story with many twists and turns. Harry is getting himself into many more predicaments with his enemy Lord Voldermont. While continuing to attend Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, Harry is learning a great deal more about charms, potions and defense against the dark arts.<br />In this story Harry is chosen by the goblet of fire to participate in the tri wizard tournament, where this time there are four students. Harry was anonymously entered in the tournament by someone other that himself, nevertheless Harry continues to participate in the tournament because he is bound by his name. Harry knows that he didn't enter himself in the tournament.  He knows that someone has it in for him, so he has to be sure to watch his back.<br />While participating in the tournament a lot happens. Reeta Skeeter, the news reporter, is causing a lot of trouble around Hogwarts. She is printing false stories about a lot of people that work there, and getting them into trouble. Harry is also having problems with his scar, it is hurting because Lord Voldermont's evil is being transmitted to Harry via nightmares.<br />Over all, this story was a great hit and I recommend it for people of all ages. Whether you read it for comedy or not, the story may appeal to you. I really think that you should give Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire a chance and read it.	2002-03-12

No, Lord Voldemort (aka You-Know-Who) doesn't say this to Harry in the book, but still, this book has a very Empire-Stikes-Back like feel to it.  The book chronicles the adventures of Harry Potter and his friends during his fourth year at Hogwarts School for Wizardry and Witchcraft.  Everything has been going pretty well for Harry during his first three years at Hogwarts, with new friends, learning Quidditch, wizard training, and defeating Lord Voldemort's plans.  Turns out, though that Lord Voldemort has just been getting ready to make his big move, which comes during this book.<br />It's getting more and more obvious that JK Rowling must, to some extent or another, have planned out the entire series before she ever published the first book.  Each book is a self-contained adventure, but they all build on each other, slowly creating a complex battle between the forces of good and evil in the wizarding world.  The first three books are, in a sense, \\"Act One\\".  That is, they concern theselves with introducing us to Harry and his world, they start establishing the relationships between the various characters, they interject a BIG dose of mystery into the series, and they make us very aware of just WHY the wizarding world is so terrified of Lord Voldemort, even 13 years after his supposed demise.  Then, this book, the fourth in the series, is \\"Act Two\\" in which Voldemort makes his big move and begins the process of his return to power.  Now, at the end of book four, the lines are drawn, and the characters and conflicts are established.  Presumably, the last three books in the series will concern themselves with the battle between Harry, Dumbledore, and the rest of the forces of good to stop Voldemort and his minions.<br />The books are also getting more and more mature in their content.  There is some stuff in this one which could easily give little kids nightmares.  There are a number of fairly scary bits through the book, including the cold-blooded murders of two characters.<br />I'm not going to go too much into details of the plot, since I don't want to ruin it for you, plus things have been covered fairly well by other reviewers, but let me just say that for a long time, I had no interest in reading these books and had dismissed them as nothing more than mindless kiddie books.  However, when the movie came out, I picked up the first book out of curiosity.  Now, having eagerly devoured all four books, all this 32-year old engineer can say is, WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT???acters.<br />I'm not going to go too much into details of the plot, since I don't want to ruin it for you, plus things have been covered fairly well by other reviewers, but let me just say that for a long time, I had no interest in reading these books and had dismissed them as nothing more than mindless kiddie books.

This book was considerably bigger than all the rest. And when I had begun to read it, it was also considerably better than all of the rest. There was more suspense, a better plot, but however, there was no quidditch. In order to make up for such a popular thing, J.K Rowling had to do something equally as interesting, if not more interesting. But then again, how could you totally eliminate quidditch from a Harry Potter book? Harry Potter is quidditch. However, Rowling, I am sure, knew that she couldn't eliminate quidditch, and was able to incorporate it in this massive 1000 page hit. I would like to go on about how much I love Harry Potter, and the endless reasons that you should read it, and tell you all of the best parts of the book, but I am not going to be the one to spoil it for you.	2002-03-11

This by far is a much more sinister book.<br />That said, there are many lighthearted moments as well.  Especially in the beginning when the Weasleys meet Harry's folks.  That made me laugh.<br />Though serious undertones slowly entrench themselves deeper and deeper as Harry Potter enters a tri wizard cup tournament.  From there the book goes through a series of puzzles and challenges as Harry participates in the tournament.Finally in the end, you know the plot.  That's the predictable part.  What isn't is the result of the plot.  In the first three books, the consequences to Potter himself never seemed negative.  Here though some real consequences start to form as the outline for the last three books comes clear.<br />You meet a lot more new and interesting characters and even see some old ones return such as sirius black.

I am quite a big book fan and I read a lot of books before I read this one, but just the word Harry Potter changes the meaning of literature completly.

But don't just read the forth, read them all! The only bit I didn't like was Rita Skeeter. Her reports on Harry etc. annoyed me, but J.K Rowling said she was put in there to demonstrate a point - that being famous can have it's downsides and she was there to give Harry the pain of fame, so I think Rita Skeeter was mabye necessary.

And they showed how Harry had grown and matured over the past 4 years. Harry is loyal, devoted, and always tries to do the right thing. He doesn't always think before he leaps but then getting out of the subsequent predicaments is part of the story. It will be fun to see how Harry continues to grow and mature. This book had a more serious tone than the previous books, and I don't think the latter part is suitable for children under 9, unless they are mature for their age. It really gets pretty scary there for a while. I think parents should read this one first, and then decide whether to let their kids read it.	2002-02-28

Rowling uses dynamic characters to fill hopeful message	After millions of copies sold, thousands of children hooked and hundreds of families addicted, it is blatantly appropriate to say that the influence of J.K.Rowling's books remains contagious and infectious. From first hearsay of Rowling's unconquerable quartet of literature, the presence of great literary devices was detectable. To the reader, the most obvious example would be her use of dynamic characters,situational irony and a somehwhat satirical theme.<br />  Harry Potter, a \\"cinderella\\" to certain extent embodies a change of poor living and few friends to a magical wizard lifestyle filled with fun and dreams only fit for fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed all the books but my free reading choice was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I really enjoyed this book among the others because of the situational irony employed by Rowling. A prejudice tone felt as muggles were placed against wixards gives a good idea as to the authors feelings of prejudice and racism. As in many other forms of literature, difference is portrayed as not always better but only to prove that it is ignorance that stands between the two.<br />  Overall, I enjoyed the 3rd Harry Potter novel the most but as for the Goblet of Fire, a definite recommendation would be in order. Though dynamic characters and situational irony give the audience as well as thousands of children's imaginations a mystical captivation, Rowling's use of a somewhat satirical theme pushes this book from good to great. An insight to the world that differences should be accepted but also embraced mirrors the innocent want to succeed and help others succeed in life. This novel was above and beyond what was expected and imagined. Now the only question is when the 5th will be out!	2002-02-25

By far the thickest of the four, as of Jan 2002, I carefully predict<br />that the thickness shall not increase as the series progresses.<br />Contrary to the complaints of most critics about the size of the book,<br />I submit that Rowling is now writing to her dedicated readers, and is<br />not trying to draw in new fans with this work.  We demand this<br />progression.<br />All things aside this is the deepest, richest and broadest book in the<br />series.  We are once more introduced to new storylines and dimensions,<br />a hallmark of the previous books.  As I mentioned in my previous<br />reviews, storylines that were developed in the first three books pass<br />through this volume and on towards the future.<br />The return of the Dark Lord is an almost welcome event at this<br />juncture, partially because a confrontation was inevitable and also due<br />to the fact that the fate of Harry is ultimately tied up with his<br />nemesis.  Their symbiotic relationship can only result in one outcome;<br />an endless struggle for power and dominance over each other.<br />New dimensions of the wizard world continue to unfold with brilliant<br />elements like Portkeys (for instant teleportation), the Quidditch World<br />Cup (a natural evolution of the favorite wizarding sport) and the<br />TriWizard Tournament (a fantastic new competition).  The introduction<br />of other wizarding schools broadens the scope of Rowling's world by<br />several magnitudes, and so she continues to amaze us as she peels away<br />curtains, revealing more of her imagination.<br />The most important element introduced in the series thus far, in my<br />humble opinion, is the wizard discipline of Auror.  In the past I found<br />myself grumbling at the ravages and madness of the Dark Wizards.  Every<br />misdeed and crime they committed made me wonder if there was no<br />organized resistance to the evil.<br />When the Auror Mad-Eye Moody appears for the first time, I almost<br />cheered.  He represents a breed of wizard that dedicate their entire<br />lives to the pursuit, capture and even destruction of Dark Wizards.  I<br />feel that without such sacrifice and focus, evil would certainly have<br />the upper hand over good.<br />It was certainly heartening to me when Moody recommends this lonely and<br />agonizing path to Harry.  I believe this is the most likely path for<br />our champion, given the struggles he has endured with Dark Magic since<br />his birth.  I don't wish him pain and suffering, but the stuff his soul<br />is made of suggests he would not find peace unless he tried the hardest<br />he could to right wrongs in the world around him.<br />As always, our heroes continue to grow and mature.  We are certainly<br />seeing the blossoming of romances and other higher aspirations.<br />Brought many smiles to my face.<br />The staggering conclusion, and the gravity of the events to follow in<br />book five, make me wonder how will our heroes survive this?  It seems<br />that the lines are being drawn for cruel and ruthless War between good<br />and evil.  People are taking sides, and who knows if Harry, Hermione<br />and Ron will have the strength, courage, wisdom and vision to survive?<br />Thus the last chapter is titled - The Beginning.e represents a breed of wizard that dedicate their entire<br />lives to the pursuit, capture and even destruction of Dark Wizards.

Most impressive are the characters, especially Severus Snape. It would have been so easy for Rowling to make him the posterboard-villain of the series, yet the depth of his psyche is astounding. This is especially made clear in this book.<br />Most tantalizing are the little clues thrown in every so often; dedicated readers constantly read through the book to find them. If you look carefully, you can predict with some detail the answers to The Great Questions: Why does Voldemort want to kill Harry? What will happen next? Where will the battle lines be drawn?<br />Any reader should immediately buy all four books of the series, if you haven't done so already. The first two are \\"fun\\" and Rowling clearly is taking much from \\"pop fantasy,\\" but in the third book she really comes into her own.

The fourth one loyally retains these features for its younger readers, but adds a whole new dimension of intriguing themes. A multitude of sub-plots boil away, each commenting on analogous situations in the real world. Nonetheless, the plotlines all wrap up at the end very satisfactorily (\\"like a jigsaw puzzle\\"), while leaving the mouth wet in anticipation of the fifth book.<br />The majority of the book is fairly light-hearted but the opening chapter gives a hint of the dark, overbearing finale that will leave Hogwarts, and indeed all of Europe, a much less safe place by the time the fifth book arrives on shelves.	2002-02-11

Another great adventure from Ms. Rowling.  This time we find Harry, living for the summer with the Dursleys on Privet Drive, two weeks before going back to Hogwarts.  He has been starving all summer, because his enormous cousin, Dudley, is on a strict diet, and Harry's aunt believes they all should have to eat what Dudley has to eat.  Harry lives on stale birthday cake he has hidden under the floorboards in his bedroom.<br />He wakes from a terrible nightmare one night, his scar burning, and a horrible feeling of dread.  His fears are soon pushed aside, though, as he travels with the Weasleys to the Quidditch World Cup.  All kinds of adventures ensue until Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts.<br />Upon arriving at school, the students discover that the usual Quidditch cup will not be contested this year, as an old tournament, The Triwizard Tournament, has been revived.  Only witches and wizards 17 years of age and older can compete.  Students from competing schools will compete with the one student selected from Hogwarts.<br />What happens when Harry's name is selected as one of the champions to compete begins a rollercoaster ride of an adventure!  Who entered him in the tournament?  Why does his scar continue to burn?  Another great mystery and another suprising ending.	2002-02-11

Sour Grapes, all of you! A best seller is just that. A book that sells the most copies, regardless of its intended readership. Put Ms. Rowling back on the top of the \\"real\\" list where she belongs!<br />These books belong to all ages.  Every member of my family has read them, borrowed them from others and then purchased their own copies, attended the 4th book's midnight unveiling parties and eagerly await the next installment!  My 74 year-old mother in law was recently widowed and received the boxed set of Potter books to distract her from her own grief.  She is now a Potter-maniac in her own right and snatches up every Potter tie-in product she finds! (mouse pad, coffee mug etc!)<br />It's a rare author indeed who can give children, parents and grandparents a magical world they can't wait to share with each other.<br />I highly recommend Jim Dale's audio versions.  They are richly characterized without ommitting a single word (trust me, my 12-year old has listened repeatedly with the books open trying to catch any mistakes and so far has found only one... where Dale refers to \\"Snape\\" as \\"Snipe\\".) My husband is a truck driver who loves making the miles fly by while getting immersed in life at Hogwarts and he's gotten other drivers hooked on the series as well!<br />I could go on and on touting the virtues of these books (the foster child who takes a great deal of comfort from the abused and neglected boy who discovers his own magic) but if you've read them, you already know and if you haven't, what's stopping you?	2002-02-07

I found the characters to be more fleshed out, as they were with the first book (but seemed to lose somewhat in books 2 and 3).  I also very much enjoyed the introduction of characters from other parts of the wizarding world.  It gave the whole story a much more round, realistic feel to it ie:there is more to the wizarding world than just Hogwart's Academy.<br />There are places where I felt that the events transpire in a somewhat thin fashion.  For example:if there is truth serum then why does anyone have to worry about trust, why can't we just administer it to those who claim to no longer support the Dark Lord and get on with it - I also felt that Harry's &quot;win&quot; against Voldemort this time to be a litte too convenient.  Yet, I have to remind myself and the other reviewers that this book is for children.  It is not designed to have the complexity of adult fiction.  Which brings me to another issue...<br />The next paragraph in not a complaint, simply a parental advisory:<br />Some have claimed that this book is morally subversive.  I would not go so far as to say that.  However, I do, personally, feel that the age recommendation given, 9-12 years old, is too low.  If I were to rate this book as a movie I would minimally give it a PG-13 rating, perhaps even a &quot;soft&quot; R.  After all, it does include murder, and the mixing of a potion by taking bones from a grave, cutting off someone's hand, and taking blood from a young boy's arm.  I would not allow my own child, under the age of 13, to read this book.  I am an admitted conservative (I won't allow my toddler to watch any of the modern Disney movies), so each must judge for themselves.  I strongly recommend that all parents read this book before allowing thier child to read it, so that they may judge the individual child's readiness and discuss the themes in the book with the child.  I do not feel this is &quot;morally subversive&quot; material, as another review has suggested.  But a child should be able to understand ideas like cheating isn't ok just because everyone else is doing it, before they read the book, lest they hold up Harry Potter and what he does as a hero or role model.<br />End of parental advisory.<br />One other issue that I had with this book, the same issue that I had with book 2 and 3, is that the author constantly regurgitates information from the previous books in the series.  I find this offensive in any series novel.  Readers should take the time to read a series in order so that they understand what is happening without &quot;cliff notes&quot; scattered through the book.  Authors should not pander to those who are too lazy to read the first books.  At the very least, it disrupts the story for the reader who has read the previous books because you feel like you are stopped at a red light waiting for the story to go on after the author has finised catching the other readers (who did not read the first books) up with the background.s another review has suggested.

I have read all of the Harry Potter books, and the Goblet of Fire has been my favorite by far. In this book, Harry and his friends begin to come of age and prove themselves as talented wizards. Harry's successful completion of all the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament helps him live up to his great name, and some begin to feel a new respect for him. The return of Lord Voldemort shatters the perfect happy ending clich&eacute; that many books of today hinge on. Harry and Ron also begin to have a new interest other than magic - girls! It is very clear who Harry has a crush on, but I can't help wondering if there is something going on between Ron and Hermione...?<br />Some people say that the Harry Potter books are a negative influence on kids; some even say they promote witchcraft. This could not be further from the truth. The books all give a wonderful view of a magical, mesmerizing world that is just plain fun to read about. I would recommend these books to anyone. My 8-year-old cousin loves them, my mom loves them, and I - a senior in high school - love them. The writing of J.K. Rowling is so vivid and clear, that I can actually imagine myself sitting in Potions behind Harry, or zooming around on a broomstick next to him.

In rags-to-riches tradition, J.K. Rowling, a struggling single-parent, scrawled `Sorcerer's Stone' on scraps of paper while taking care of her child and working the slave-grind part time.  Lo and behold, `Sorcerer's Stone' is picked up by a publisher and goes on to sell more than 100 million copies worldwide.  Harry Potter, that messy-haired boy with the cheap eyeglasses, becomes ubiquitous in the pop-culture climate, championed by most as an excellent way to interest children in reading, while scorned and reviled by a small (but very loud) minority of religious extremists, the same sort that gave us the Inquisition and the Salem Witch-Trials.  Well, those few might learn something if they ever deemed to pick up a copy and broaden their perspective: `evil is as evil does' is a theme intricately woven throughout the (to date) four volumes.<br />Rowling has mastered the difficult task of writing to all ages, to children and adults alike.  For though the grammar is for the most part simplistic and the prose uncomplicated, the world building, the characterizations, the build-up of suspense and the handling of multiple plot threads are all deftly done. Moreover, the writing itself is extremely accomplished and in every volume there are small, subtle asides written particularly for the more experienced mindset.  It is no surprise then that these books have gained their astonishing popularity-like `Star Wars' (to cross-compare mediums), Harry Potter spans the generational gap in terms of entertainment and overall composition.<br />In `Goblet of Fire', the most recent and by far the largest of the series, Rowling introduces a whole slew of complications within the wizard-world framework: new characters, new situations, and ominous hints at Dark Lord Voldemort's inevitable resurrection. A Tri-wizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts during Harry's fourth year, and two different schools arrive to present challengers.  Meanwhile, the students are forced to adjust to yet another Defense against the Dark Arts teacher (their fourth so far) and Hermione Granger decides to campaign for the benefits of wage-slaves...oops, I mean house-elves everywhere.  Harry, Ron et all are getting older, and starting to notice the opposite sex; favorites from previous books also appear, including Sirius Black, Dobby the Elf, and the befuddled Cornielius Fudge.<br />The author has stated that she plans on seven Harry Potter volumes altogether; with that in mind, it is easy to see how pivotal this particular episode is: the introductions have been made, the conflict established.  From this point on, nothing in Harry Potter's world will be the same again...<br />Bring on book 5!present challengers.

The way the author chose to describe every little situation was incredible. It was like reading a script of a soon-to-become movie and making it real in my head.<br />One of the things that I didn't like was the amount of fantasy in this story. Most of the things that happened to Harry Potter would never be seen in our normal everyday lives. For example, the talking hat and the sudden popularity for not getting killed by an evil sorcerer. In my opinion, J.K. Rowlings must have a lot of imagination to come up with this sort of stuff. The characteristics of Harry Potter is also a good of example of exaggerating the part a hero plays. I couldn't seem to find any faults in his character, only in his surroundings.<br />Although Harry Potter was a flawless and perfect character, the story follows the stages of an epic story. He has two best friends and a giant who act as his mentors always trying to stop him from overcoming the challenges that are presented to him, in this case preventing him to enter the TriWizards Tournament, but in the end help him go through it all. He has a couple of obstacles like his classmate Malfoy, and his main challenge: facing lord Voldemort once again, then saving the &iexcl;¥world&iexcl;¦ and returning to his everyday lifestyle.<br />Harry Potter was written specifically to entertain and I would recommend it just for that.

This is (possibly) my favourite novel in the series and definitely the most accomplished as a piece of literature: it is closer to being an adult novel than any of its predecessors and has quite a complex plot for a &quot;children's&quot; book.<br />It is by far the longest of the books to date which is excellent as it allows the plot to be developed in far greater detail and also allows for deeper characterisation. This gives Rowling the opportunity to describe her world in even greater detail and makes for fascinating reading. However, the book is a lot darker than the others and, at times, is quite creepy and verges on the horrific (notably the chapter in which Harry confronts You-Know-Who (oh okay, Valdemort!)) and I feel younger readers might well be scared by this. Such writing and the length suggest that this book is marketed as much at adults as it is at children.<br />I will not repeat the plot here (as so many others have done that already) but I thoroughly enjoyed this book even though it is darker than the rest. We also see the beginnings of what could be (will be?) a blossoming love interest between Ron and Hermione--or will she choose Harry instead?

Rowling grabs you, and doesn't ever let you go..emotional highs and lows, magic, tragedy and comedy all nicely tied together with a fast paced story.<br />But she has real things to say to the adult reader.  I completely disagree with a recent review which said the only moral to the story was that its okay to cheat, since everyone does.  To the contrary, being true to oneself has laways been rewarded in this series, and the current book is no exception.<br />Also, like much great literature, the book is also about literature.  Hogwarts is, of course a book--a place of magic hidden fromthe rest of the world, where many things are possible, and some rules need to be broken to keep things interesting.<br />By the way, Rowling's description of prison is so accurate, it makes one wonder who she has been talking to.  Prison does eventually leach away one's soul, til you loose all touch with reality.  The dementors are real.<br />Can't wait for book five--but what happens when we all finish seven?

It may be because the last time I read it was 1-2 years ago, but the beginning of the book seemed a little unclear to me, even a little confusing.  And also, unlike the 1st 3, a lot of the stuff in the book were quite predictable.  It ended up, that towards the ending of the book (or last 80 or so pages) I kept asking myself, so when is Voldemort gonna show up? And I even started to suspect almost every character to have at least some connection with him.  And the ending was kind of sudden, it left me hanging there, not knowing what to expect.  Nonetheless, I must say that I too, later on could not force myself to put down this book, eager to find out the ending.  Also, this book compared to the first 3, stressed much more on emotions, particularly love and sadness.  And it went into much more depths of the characters, letting us understand more about their personalities and background.  Despite the slight flaws in this book, it is ultimately a great book that will lead you into a magical world that no other book can do quite as well.	2002-01-08

The main plot revolves around the TriWizard tournament, a wizardly contest between the champions of various schools.  Harry does not solve one single element of the tournament without either cheating or having some cheat on his behalf - including entering the tournament in the first place.  To be fair, at least Harry believes everyone else is cheating, too.  Unfortunately, this seems to be the closest thing to a moral of the story.<br />Rowling's world is losing some of its internal consistency as well.  If truth potions exist, why is there a concern at all about who is a follower of Voldemort and who is not?  How can potions that second-year-students can whip together consistently confound the most brilliant wizards around on a long-term basis?  Why is Voldemort such a dangerous foe, when he makes every classic bad-guy blunder known to man?  I was actually rooting for him by the end.  The dumb-luck-that-saves-Harry-from-Voldemort this time is the corniest yet, particularly when combined with the collosal stupidy of Harry's enemies that was necessary to allow it to happen.<br />Azkaban had given me hope that this series might turn out well, but this book has made me pessimistic again.	2002-01-07

I have read The Chronicals of Narnia, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, both which have been compared to Harry Potter. When my mom first gave me the books, I was skeptical because they seemed like they were childish and I wasn't interested. I put them on my shelf and they sat there nearly 3 months until I finally picked them up one rainy day. I read the four books in nearly 3 days. The moment I finished the first, I picked up the seconed. By the fourth, I was anticipating a very good read and I certainly wasn't dissappointed. Rowling has delivered a fabulous storyline and a magical new world. While other books are a bit redundant, these never dissapoint.<br /> This book starts out with Harry at the Dursley's, where they are being as unfair and cruel as ever. Harry gets invited to attend the Quidditch World Cup with Ron. At the match a group of death eaters show up to frighten everyone. As Harry and his friends retreat into the woods, they see a Dark Mark conjured in the sky. The Dark Mark is the sign of Voldemort. This is just the start of everything that is going to happen to Harry this year. The end will come as a real surprise and it will set the stage for a very dark end of the series. There is also romance brewing among the characters, which just demonstrates Rowlings ability to grow with her fans and will also make a great side-plot.<br /> By the end of the 4th book, I was swelled up with emotions of anger and sadness, and I am amazed that she could portray these emotions in such a believable way. I am now eagerly anticipating the release of the fifth book. Bottom line: Despite a lot of criticism of the hype surrounding these books, these are a must read. I loved them!	2002-01-03

Given Rowling's past track record, it wasn't too surprising to open this novel to find over 700 pages of text; each Harry book, up to now, has been successively longer, bigger in scope, and arguably better.  Who knows, maybe by the time that we arrive at the seventh and final novel, we'll have something twice as grand as Victor Hugo's masterpiece on  redemption--at least in size.  Harry Potter is, first and foremost, a children's story, and as a result it's highly unlikely that we'll see its author using it as a platform on which to discuss her view on the vice and folly of the world, as much as we may like to think that she's beginning to cater to her adult audience with each passing novel.  Everything here, in short, is still as it always was, but just in bigger doses.<br />The front flap of the novel does good on calling this a pivotal installment in the Harry Potter universe, however. Our young<br />adventurers are now beginning to get a taste of the growing pains associated with adolescence, so much of the innocence of the<br />12-year-olds that we've been subjected to up to now begins to gradually abrade as the pages draw by. The older<br />audience--and, presumably, the -growing- audience--will probably find that this makes it easier to relate to the characters;  thus, the immersion factor of the story is turned up several very, very forceful notches.<br />Strangely enough, I was left flabbergasted near the final pages of the novel, when the more \\"pivotal\\" element of this book actually made its presence felt.  Had this never taken place, I would have been more than satisfied, happy to look forward to the next installment.<br />But this isn't to say that the novel is entirely perfect, like the last two installments.  The main mystery of this story is largely unfulfilling, probably because we don't learn what Rowling is even trying to get at until full disclosure comes near the end of the book.  In hindsight, the situations now all seem very erratically nerve-wrecking;  but the first time through it felt as though everybody was simply running around in the dark with some secret agenda, and since none of these characters were fleshed out enough for me to care, I found myself paying more attention to the puerile, deliciously adolescent woes of Harry and his friends.<br />There's also two notes of interest that should probably be brought up.  One is that the book apparently must have missed the editor's desk, for there was not a single sentence in which the word \\"oh\\" was followed by a comma (some of the other errors are passable, but the \\"Oh I didn't know\\"'s and \\"Oh I guess\\"'s get particularly tiring since Rowling seems to have developed a strong penchant for that two-letter word--it's used about three times per page).  Second is that the book begins with some very crass, adolescent humor--the narrative avoids this as the characters begin to grow more serious, but I'd advise care while parents read about breezes in private areas and \\"Uranus\\" to their children in bed.<br />I surmise that \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" will probably come to be looked upon as the changing point in the chronicle of Harry Potter's life; all indications point toward a new, improved formula.  Without a doubt, the fork that is so eloquently woven into the final chapters bellows that now is the time to get ready for the real adventure to begin, and since Rowling hasn't disappointed in any of her three follow-ups, I find no reason to fear the future.  If anything, we'll probably be treated to more of what we've been nibbling on until now, and if that turns out to be the case, I certainly won't be one to complain--these books are more enrapturing than veelas themselves.recking;  but the first time through it felt as though everybody was simply running around in the dark with some secret agenda, and since none of these characters were fleshed out enough for me to care, I found myself paying more attention to the puerile, deliciously adolescent woes of Harry and his friends.<br />There's also two notes of interest that should probably be brought up.

I am very shocked at how some people think of this book. I mean, I always knew there were weirdos out there who think Harry Potter is dangerous...people who think that it puts bad ideas into kids' minds. There is nothing terrible about these books. It's fantasy, and some people don't have any imagination to believe in it. Just because the book says something doesn't mean that it's real. I read about some fool kid who jumped off his house's roof on a broom because the book said brooms flew. HONESTLY! It's fantasy, people, it's not real! I also read about some girl who was so scared of the books that she had nightmares for a month. Obviously she wasn't old enough not to be scared, so why were they read to her, or why did she read them? They are thrilling and chilling, but not scary! Someone else said that the only people who read Harry Potter are people who are uneducated, don't pay attention in class, or slackers who need something to read for a summer reading list at the last second. NOT TRUE! I'm a sixth grader, a straight-A student, and I don't procrastinate. All of my friends are the same, and we adore Harry Potter and its capturing story. J.K.

That's the only problem I saw with the books. But, nothing is perfect. Right? These are all great fictional stories presented within the framswork of fantasy. For those who enjoy fantasy, I would also recommend you read, while waiting for &quot;Harry Potter - Book 5&quot;, a little known book that does the same thing --- except the stories presented within the framework of fantasy are true stories that have educational benefit toward teaching character and leadership.

The forces of ignorance - embodied in particular by Rita Skeeter and the Dursleys - provide another peril that abets the more obvious villains.<br />There is a depth in plot and character (and a page count) that are unusual in a novel aimed towards children.

The Harry Potter series is NOT just for young children.<br />Having read all these books, I rate Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire very well.

And to those people who think so, Harry is not evil, but a pretty good role-model for the younger generation to follow.<br />Harry, as a character, is easy to relate to. Rowling has done a magnificent job on Harry here. Most writers tend to focus on the physical aspect of things. Rowling has kept that reaonably simple (Black messy hair, glasses, scar). In fact, what makes Harry special is the way that the reader can see him. The kid who was victimised at school. Spurned by his last remaining family, Harry is a boy who many recognise but few actually know.<br />In fact, go to your local high school, to the year 7 classroom. You will see your Harrys, Rons and Hermiones. You will also see your Malfoys and Snapes.<br />It is the magic of the characters, rather than what comes out the end of Harry's wand that brings the book together and gives the series a following. The plot is well thought out, beckoning you to turn the next page.<br />J.K Rowling has said that there is a bit of Harry in her. I'm not surprised, there's a bit of Harry in all of us. In fact, if I was to relate closely to any of the characters in the series myself, it would be Harry.

Be prepaid to spend some time if you start reading this book because you won't want to stop unitl you are finished, and if you are like me, you'll be wishing the 5th book was out already.	2001-12-12

I read the first few chapters of the first book and got hooked.<br />This is by far the best and longest of the four books.  If you've not read the others, you MUST read them first just so you will get the background out of the way. The subsequent stories build upon the previous one(s). As in the previous books, Rowling is very descriptive in detailing everything that happens, the characters and their environment.  Envisioning the story unfold through her words is very easy.  The book was a real page turner and I stayed up late trying to get in &quot;just one more chapter&quot;.  I lost a lot of sleep over this one.<br />I saw the movie translation of the first book and was generally pleased with it.  However, some aspects could not be put on the big screen.  Much of the charm, humor and character inner thoughts were left out (not to mention a lot of other stuff, even though it was 2.5 hours long).<br />I recommend reading the books and skipping the movies.  The books will be way more satisfying.  One word of caution:  Rowling is British and writes like it; so some of the language may need deciphering (treacle fudge?).	2001-12-10

They have been light hearted and eventful and have dealt with coming of age issues in a way that captures the interest of an adult without losing the interest of a child.  I can't imagine a better set of bedtime reading books to share with children even as old as 10 or 12 years.<br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth in the series, is another good one, but I found it difficult to get into after the first chapter.  The characters are again some of them charming, some of them intriguing, and the setting just as wondrous as in the other books, but here the narrative seemed to wander.  After a wonderful and arresting opening, the book seemed to stall out.  The gap between the almost Agatha Christie opening and the by now almost banal Qwiddich match left one wondering what the point of the whole thing was.  Rowling's stories heretofore have been fast moving, with few digressions and a tapestry of characters whose roles have been fairly clear cut even when they have been designed to throw the reader off the track.  (One is used to the latter device when one has read enough murder mysteries.)  Here it takes almost 500 pages before their purpose in the story becomes clear.  In fact it took the device of the Pensieve to bring the plot again into focus for me.<br />While it took me minutes to read the first chapter, and I was riveted again from chapter 29 to the end, the 28 chapters in between took me almost two months to get through.  In fact I only persisted because I was certain that the end would make them somehow more pertinent, and it did.  Unlike Rawling's previous three books, the chapters in this one seemed to lack the connecting suspense that kept me moving from one to the next in order to find out &quot;what happened next.&quot;  I could easily set the book aside at the end of a chapter and not get back to it for days, where previous books had been finished in a single day.<br />I still think these are charming books with much to say to everyone.  I can't imagine not having a complete collection especially for a family with young children, but  I think that this book is definitely the one for which I'd wait for the paperback edition or a lower price before adding it.r />I still think these are charming books with much to say to everyone.

I think it's blatantly obvious.  Harry Potter is universal, filled with glorious characters and also with characters so digusting you wonder why they're that way.  Each Harry Potter book has a moral, and the moral in THE GOBLET OF FIRE is the strongest one the series has to offer.  J.K. Rowling has the wonderful ability to give the reader enough details to give him/her an idea of the story but few enough details to let our imaginations soar.

However, as surprising as it truly is, this book reads faster than the first, though it it more than two and a half times longer.<br />The plot is mysterious, adventrous and fun, and the conclusion is downright frightening. Also, the characters are much older in this one, and have more abilities than in the previous three, which makes it all the more interesting.<br />I'll definitely be in line to buy part five opening day, and hope it lives up to this one, though I do think that that's close to impossible. &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is the most rewarding of the four by far, and I'll be the first to admit that I've been pulled into the phenomenon of Harry Potter after years of refusing to read these books.	2001-12-08

Being a firm believer that the &quot;book is usually better than the movie&quot;, I decided to re-read &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; before seeing the film.  Well, in the past two weeks I have read all 4 books.  &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; has certainly been my favorite.  Not only are there the usual twists and turns that we have come to expect from the &quot;Harry&quot; series, but there is also a good deal of character development as Harry and his friends mature.  The ending definitely leaves you wanting more.  For those who feel that Harry moves through the world unscathed and without emotional baggage, he certainly picks it up in this story.  My one concern is that with the cheerful picture of Harry on the cover, younger readers may think that this is another light hearted story of the young wizard.  Probably any child below 10 years will alternately be bored by the character development and horrified at the ending.  However, I would strongly recommend it to older children and adults.  Not since the Tolkien series have I been so drawn into a world of fantasy and imagination.  I especially like Dumbledore's summation at the end of the book...&quot;when you are given the choice of doing what is right or what is easy...&quot;  Harry continues to do what is right and so does the author.	2001-12-06

Just like the 3rd book, it made me think about the true identity of a person.  From the consistent topic in Sharekespear, we shouldn't judge someone from appreance.  I wonder if Dumbledore is really good person or what kind of person professor Snape is (he continued to look like a villian from the first volume, but he showed he sticks to the good side against Voldermort).  From this book, there seems to be a beginning of romance if it is appropriate to tell for children's book (but I think it's ok.  Romance is about love, isn't it?).  I wonder what Ron feel for Hermione and Hermione think of Harry.  I wonder when the fifth book will be published and what kind of story it proceeds with clues thrown in previous ones.<br />Though Harry smiled on the cover, I was sad when reading the last page. Why was that honest and brave boy killed because he was on the way of Voldermort  (I received an e-mail askinf if Harry was killed.  Of course not.  Without Harry how the author can write the seriese to 7th volume?

I'm 38 and after seeing the movie with my 5 and 9 year old daughters, decided to read the next book (Chamber of Secrets) in the series. Needless to say I got totally sucked in and by the end of the week had bought the entire series and read them all. My 9 year old is following suit but not getting through quite as fast.<br />Although even the first book (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) was very good, I felt that each subsequent book got better. The Goblet of Fire was easily the best, the 700+ pages went in a flash and I was left with serious withdrawal symptoms.  I heard that Amazon.com had to hire 9,000 staff and Fedex reserved 100 planes just to ship the pre-orders on this book.  I'm sure that these numbers will double with the next book.<br />Rowlings really knows how to write in a way that transports you into a magical world in your mind.  But despite the magicial setting, the human interactions and behaviour are realistic and easy to identify with.  I saw many parallels with my childhood experiences in boarding school in England.<br />For those who have not read all the previous books, I would suggest that you read each book in the series in ther correct order since some of elements of the incredible ending twists in the earlier books are referred to in the later books.	2001-11-29

This book, although darker than the first 3, still maintained the same effect of making us actually feel the magic going on, not just seeing it. We also realize that our beloved Harry is growing up. He starts to take an interest in girls, which shows that Harry is a very normal boy, dealing with normal problems. Harry is not the smartest boy, not the nicest boy, not the most gifted boy magically. But all of this helps us to sympathize and become one with the boy we have all come to love. Harry proves in this story that he is truly an individual person who possesses a powerful spirit and soul. And even at the end of this book, when he knows hard times are to come, he faces it with a positive outlook because he knows that good will eventually triumph over evil. This book can teach us all powerful and valuable lessons in how to be moral and good people. In this time of trial for our country, who wouldn't want to escape, even if for only a few hours, into Harry's wonderful world of fantasy and magic?	2001-11-27

Still I love Harry Potter as any of his young fans (if not more). To me the storyline keeps me excited and engrossed in the reading process, but the deeper messages passed by Rowling in her books makes me ponder even long after I read them. Young readers, think about questions like<br />&quot;what makes a successful person -- bravery, intelligence,  diligence, or ambition?&quot;<br />&quot;In face of hardship, what do you choose -- the easy way, or the right way?&quot;<br />&quot;Should anyone be superior because of his/her looks, wealth, class, or should there be something deeper as the standard?&quot;<br />&quot;Should people be given a second chance, and should you trust them?&quot;<br />...<br />I can already see this is becoming a really *dull* review for many of you out there. But I'm just writing them out in hope of making the most of reading Rowling. If you could, keep these questions in mind when you read Harry Potter and when you deal with real life. You may find you gain much more than just reading the best stories in the world.	2001-11-26

I best enjoyed how all the characters are growing up and starting to act like it.  They're dealing with more complicated things than mean relatives and not having any friends.  Life gets hard after a while, and it's even harder for Harry.  J.K. does a fantastic job of showing how one boy's life is changing forever.

Imagination, creativity, magic and surprises take center stage in the fourth installment of Harry Potter, and it proves once again that Harry simply gets better with age.<br />Never a dull moment at Hogwarts.  This year something different is on the horizon and has all the Hogwarts students giddy with excitement.  This &quot;something&quot; comes in the form of the Triwizard Tournament, a competition of skill and bravery between three rival wizarding schools.  Only one champion per school is allowed, and Harry is too young to compete.  But someone, somewhere, has it out for Harry and concocts a plan that turns his fourth year completely upside down...and with fatal consequences.<br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is more mature and humorous than the previous three, but does not devalue the adventure and magic that has become its trademark.

Story: sure, these books are predictable -- we know Harry will win every time. But the joy of this series is not the outcome, but the journey -- HOW he wins. That's what makes Harry Potter so enjoyable to read, and what makes this fourth book the best yet (#3 was also great, as was #1...#2 was the weakest, in my opinion). His hurdles become greater each time, and so does the reader's appreciation of his accomplishments.<br />2. Plot twists: we've all come to expect that there will be some sort of plot twist...nevertheless, the specifics of this plot twist always take me by surprise (except, of course, when curiosity gets the better of me and I read ahead). I never see the specific betrayal coming, even though I know there will be one. In this book, the betrayal (I won't give it away) had me floored -- there were so many red herrings, I didn't know who to trust (or not to trust). Maybe I'm just gullible. I hope I'm as gullible for the next 3 installments.<br />3. Characters: I think the trio is getting more and more differentiated. Hermione is becoming an independent woman, with a love interest. Ron is becoming not just Harry's best friend, but someone who is searching for his own place in the world. And Harry, still the reluctant hero, is dealing with his fears in new ways. So I would disagree with anyone who says that the POV in this story is muddled -- on the contrary, I now have an even greater sense of the differences in these characters, and an even keener interest in seeing how they turn out.<br />And that's it. Keep up the great work, Ms. Rowling. You're not only writing great stories, but you're getting people of all ages to READ.	2001-11-18

Hugo Award, Best Novel 2001<br />WARNING: This is the fourth book of the series, read them in order for maximum enjoyment and understanding.<br />The Harry Potter series, for those of you who have been living in a cave in Afganistan the past few years, postulates a society of wizards and magical creatures, living alongside but hidden from the ordinary non-magical people, or &quot;muggles.&quot;  Harry is the child of two wizards.  At a young age Harry's parents were killed by You Know Who, but miraculously Harry survived the Death Curse cast upon him by the evil wizard, and the spell killed the caster.  Harry spent his childhood with his mother's muggle relations, and knew nothing about magic until he was old enough to go to boarding school.<br />My boy complains that this is a gender-switched retelling of The Worst Witch; just as The Lion King is Hamlet in cat costumes.  There are only seven stories, the art is in the telling.  And J. K. Rowling tells this story well.<br />As I write this there are almost four thousand reviews of this book, over three thousand of them with a five star rating.  Let me just add that while the media insist on calling these children's books, adults can enjoy them too.<br />I cannot stress strongly enough read the books in order!  This book makes a turning point in the tone of the series.  This book may be too violent for some pre-teens (individual parents should judge), it is not more than a PG-13.	2001-11-13

Rowling, is fantastic story that reveals many different aspects of literature. First, Rowling uses flashbacks to help the reader hint at Harry Potter's miraculous birth. Next, many of the characters can be considered foils, such as Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom, Potter and Draco Malfoy. These characters are exact opposites of each other and in Potter and Malfoy's case are there for enemies. Finally, Rowling's use of stereotype categorizes the wizards from the `muggles.' Rowling has shown through this enchanting tall tale a simple yet delightful story.<br /> When Harry first encounters Lord Voldemort he is an infant in his mother's arms. Voldemort tries to kill Potter, but his mother's love prevents this. Potter often has flashbacks of this moment, wondering what it means and why he gets them. Eventually Potter learns that when Voldemort is near these splitting headaches and flashbacks to his infancy occur. With each flashback the reader can learn more about his mother's dying love for him.<br /> Granger and Longbottom, Potter and Malfoy are all complete opposites.<br />Granger is an intelligent wizard that really applies herself to her studies. She tries to achieve everything, overwhelming herself with too many classes. But she is naturally the favorite among all of the teachers. Where as Longbottom is constantly messing a potion or spell up, causing disasters in the classroom. He tries very hard but can never quit master what the other students accomplish naturally. Potter and Malfoy are not only foils but also worst enemies. Potter is a popular wizard, not to mention a worldwide hero among the wizards. Potter is allowed to do things that other wizards his age cannot, such as play on the Quidditch team. Draco on the other hand is a bully that is despised by most wizards. He is evil and cannot be on the Quidditch team or participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament like Potter. Malfoy is and evil wizard compared to Potter who is a good wizard, trying to only perform good clean magic. Foils allow the reader to comprehend to characters at the same time by comparing their differences.<br /> Finally, Rowling shows the wizards' different stereotype upon the muggles, or non-wizards. The wizards in the novel often refer to muggles. They shun upon them, seeing them as unequal. If any wizard has muggle parents they are made fun of bitterly. This shows how sometimes we can stereotype people because of their race or religion. But Rowling uses Hermione as a \\"half muggle\\" to show that she is impure in the eyes of others, but can still perform the spells better than most wizards her age.<br /> The use of literary devices in this novel helps the reader understand the book. Flashbacks indirectly help the reader determine what did happen. It allows the story to continue but still get that glimpse of the past. The use of foils also helps better understand the character and their part in the story. When Potter and Malfoy meet we know Malfoy is going to be the antagonist, trying to force Potter to mess. Finally, the stereotypes that the muggles receive from the wizards teach us that our stereotypes are wrong and can hurt somebody.

For me that's really fast(I take longer to read books). I agree with one of the reviews that said this one was too intense for younger fans. The book does, definatly have a different flavor. usually towards the end of every book in the series, the mystery part comes out, characters are revealed(who they REALLY are), Harry duels &quot;You Know Who&quot; and saves the day. This one will have you stumped in the end. trust me. Even for those of you who think you have the endings figured out. I'm almost fourteen, and I did get scared. I admit it.

On the contrary,you have this heavy burden on your chest knowing that the the greatest enemy is back &amp; more powerful &amp; that the end of this book is just the beginning of a more exciting, more grueling series ahead.<br />Harry Potter has matured a lot in this book.  &amp; so has its author, J.K. Rowling.<br />Of all the HP series so far, (#1 - 4), this book is highly recommended for reading &amp; worth collecting.  I cannot wait till the next one.<br />J.K.

During the daily commute in the Tube, you can easily spot several adults reading one of the series.  Just like many others, I only picked up the first one out of curiosity.  Once I picked up, I couldn't put them down.<br />I echo many readers' comments on the style and fluity of the writing.  Thus, I will not repeat them.  What made me like the series is it brought back simple pleasure of pure imagination.  Don't know about others, but cynicism and harsh reality of adult life have stifled my creativity and imagination over the years.  The Potter world is not easy either.  There are deceits, betrayal, death and loneliness.  It's just as sophisticated like the real world, which adults can relate to.  What's different is that there is black and white, right or wrong, good or evil.  It brings everything down to the basic.  And of course all the magical creatures and sweets and toys just add that much more pleasure to be in there.<br />Overall, I am proud to say I am a Potter fan!	2001-10-25

And, I have to admit, they are fun and entertaining to read. But what irks me is when people constantly refer to these as &quot;the best books ever&quot; or &quot;great literature for children.&quot; Talking to a friend (who also is a non-fanatical reader of Harry Potter), we both agreed on this sentiment. Yet when confronted by such criticisms, people blinded by Harry Potter mania tend to scoff and say, &quot;Who cares? I read it for the entertainment value.&quot; (People have said this to me before!) Really? That's great. So do I. But then please shut up about how it's a masterpiece in the making! Popularity does not equal great literature.<br />For one thing - and this is one of my biggest gripes - the characters are TOO one-dimensional. Dumbledore is way too perfect. He is trusting, believes in Harry when no one else will, was the only one who Voldemort was afraid of, blah blah blah. Boring! With JK Rowling's depiction of Dumbledore as so infallible, why not just change his name to Jesus and be done with it? Please...give the guy some depth!<br />And then there's Harry. Poor, orphaned Harry, who just happens to be the youngest Seeker in a century! Not to mention he is put in the &quot;best Hogwarts house,&quot; which has won the Interhouse Cup whatever each year he's been a member (he helped break Slytherin's winning streak!!!) Ugh. The whole poor orphan (equipped with a wicked &quot;step&quot; family) who just so happens to be insanely talented (or, in many female stories, beautiful) storyline has been done to DEATH. Cinderella, anyone?<br />And the girls. There is so much sexism in the books, but it's mainly little, subtle things...so I don't think Rowling put it there on purpose...but please, how come it's only the female characters who lose their heads and scream whenever a crisis dawns, and the males are the only ones that keep their cool? Example: when Harry flies on his broom for the first time, Ron gives an &quot;admiring whoop&quot; and the girls just shriek in alarm. Excuse me while I go pay homage to the porcelain gods.<br />The enemies are too one-dimensional, also. They are always beaten by the good guys, they are never very smart, they are shown only as evil, evil, not to mention strongly disliked and jealous, fools. I'm going to repeat what I said for Dumbledore: give the poor people some depth!<br />Well...I know that my review borders mainly on character development, etc., but that was my biggest gripe with the books, and therefore is my focus. Now I just wait for the spiteful HP fans to start swooping in...admiring whoop&quot; and the girls just shriek in alarm.

If you liked the other three, buy this one too! It is a wonderful book over all. I don't think it is the best book of the four, however, because it is a little too long. I think that as the Harry grows older and the books grow longer, younger children could lose interest in the series. For me, (I'm 20) the books are a great escape from college studies but my 10 year old brother didn't finish it.<br />I've noticed that some reviewers feel compelled to compare it to other (adult) fantasy novels like Tolkien's Ring series. I would like to say to them that although millions of adults (like me) enjoy HP, it is a children's book and is marketed that way. If you want complex adult fiction don't read Harry Potter and then criticize it for being the wrong genre! I would personally compare it with Roald Dahl's work--another children's favorite!	2001-10-17

First, let me state: I am a firmly devoted Christian and I loved all 4 books.  I have heard that it is &quot;antichristian&quot; and that it &quot;teaches magic.&quot;  This is absurd!  Most books are written these days either by nonchristians or people who feel that the particular story does not focus on religious questions.  Many people probably avoid the subject to avoid controversy.  Personally I believe that many &quot;Christian&quot; fantasy books should be placed with other fantasies.  After all, so far as I've seen, just because the story was set up around THE God instead of some make-believe god from the author's own mind doesn't affect the plot.  Simply because she avoided the subject doesn't mean she's against it.<br />Next, I must say I am 18, a Senior, and I loved this book.  I  felt myself identifying with the characters, since I'd gone through that terrible age myself.  The simplicity of the writing and characterization does not take from the storyline, and is actually a bit of a relief after hours of Heart of Darkness and Canterbury Tales.  I definitely enjoyed having something to read that remained blunt, clear, and relaxing.<br />I must say, though, I feel somewhat gipped.  Rowling leaves us with so many questions: What does Cho think of Harry?  Does he stand a chance?  What will become of Ron &amp; Hermione?  Is there any way to stop Voldemort?  There was some small resolution to some of these problems, but there isn't even a momentary eye contact to see into the character of Cho.  We have so many unanswered questions, and what does Rowling do?  She takes a break!  She stops writing!  The fifth book won't be coming out for months, and I'm left hanging!  J.K.

My 13 year old told me to say &quot;Enough with Harry Potter&quot;. I think the author is losing the gemeration of kids who started with her as they get older. He has discovered other series tat he much prefers, such as the Brian Jacques REDWALL series and the DRAGONS OF PERN series. As your kids mature, they will outgrow Harry. Too bad Harry isn't keeping up. Personally, I found this book disappointing. The author is copying from others and pawning it off as her own. No really original ideas, just hype. And this one is just a tad bit cynical and dark. Oh well, you can't hype stuff and expect it to last. I gave this 2 stars for the attempt and some fast moving passages, otherwise there is a lot better out there for your kids.	2001-09-10

Nevertheless, Rowling's writing skills have clearly matured. Her unparalleled imagination is still at work, but she has added subtle nuances that make her characters even more interesting.

It is a masterpiece. It is the beginning of what promises to be an epic engagement between the powers of Good and Evil.<br />A lot of people (too many of which have not actually read these books) find the Potter books objectionable. I have to seriously agree that less mature children should not read &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; until they can handle some of its darker aspects. Still, I find it no more objectionable than other great children's books such as &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; or &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />I praise J.K. Rowling for not glamorizing evil. As Lord Voldemort gets stronger in book four, we get to see him for what he is...the personification of evil, with nothing admirable about him.<br />There are some great new characters in book four. My favorites are Ludo Bagman and Viktor Krum (you have to love how he say Herm-o-niny).<br />I have also really come to like Cedric Diggory (who is mentioned briefly in book three). Cedric reminds me a lot of C.S. Lewis's High King Peter--the very picture of true chivalry.<br />As always, another book makes me like Harry, Hermione and Ron (all the Weasleys really--especially &quot;Weatherby&quot;) more than I did in the book before. Though human and flawed, they are great as unlikely heroes.<br />I give &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; my highest recommendation.	2001-08-24

The fact that there are nearly 4000 reviews written already for this book says it all. I have just finished reading the fourth Harry Potter novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.&quot; I can't recall being more impressed before. Having written three amazing books already, J.K. Rowling has done it again and pulled out another winner from the Sorting Hat. It is my personal opinion that the Harry Potter series outdoes many folklore authors. In fact Rowling's books are, arguably, only surpassed by J.R.R. Tolkien in their overwhelming grip on the reader - for once, the saying &quot;he couldn't put it down&quot; was true for me. Having now read all four books, and eagerly awaiting number 5, I am about to start from book one again! Please don't think these books are just for kids. The plot, character development and phenomenal imagination that comes from these books is well the buy, and exceeds that of many modern authors.

Nonetheless, I found this book to be delightful. Rowling has moved character development along very well (how refreshing to see Harry's friends finally get fed up with his neverending &quot;fame&quot;)and has left many avenues open for years 5-7 (did anyone else start wondering whether Dumbledore is everthing he says he is?). I did find the death of one character a bit gratuitous (he wasn't, despite all reports to the contrary, that big of a character to begin with) and the resurrection of Voldemort a bit too graphic for young children (heck, for me, even) but despite that this book had me wishing for the next installment (this from a person who read the first book only to prove that the &quot;hype&quot; was ridiculous and that these stories probably really were horrible).<br />I have to wonder, though, if this series can really sustain itself through seven years of Hogwarts (especially if we can't expect volume 5 for over a year)and Harry's teen years. Probably, though, Rowling can handle it. Oh... and for the sanctimonius ... who condemn these tales without reading them first, and who cry out for banishment (ever hear of a little story called &quot;Farenheit 451&quot;?) and book burnings, either get over yourselves or join the amish community... This book certainly does NOT promote evil (what do you think... that if it's read backwards a secret message will appear?). In fact, the students at Hogwarts are punished for using their magic for anything other than good and, for crying out loud, these books make no reference to devil worshipping, voodoo or anything of the sort. So I would suggest that you speak of things you know about and leave the conjecture to the students of Hogwarts.	2001-08-23

Okay, you're probably all wondering why I am writing a review of a book that came out a year ago, and the answer is I've been at school an extra year and have more juicy adjectives and writing knowledge at my disposal. Harry Potter is like the Star Wars fims in book form. The storylines are totally different, you will find no wookiees or lightsabres in this book, nor will you find magic wands or massive wizardy schools in any of the Star Wars films, but they are both phenomenons. Like George lucas, J.K Rowling has managed to draw you in with her knowing what we (I.e you) want. Each book in the series has a totally different plotline, but with the characters you know and love. People don't realise how similiar these two phenomenons are, but when you start wondering whether Lord Voldemort is Harry's father, you can't help noticing a similarity. Everyone should know the plot by now, so I won't explain who Voldemort is. The whole series is filled with enough twists and turns, you could make a roller coaster out of it. Irresistable, irreplacable and errr.... unputdownable.	2001-08-16

At the same time the references to the previous volumes are still numerous, giving to this new episode a perfect continuity in the story.<br />The first element that jumps out is the fact that Harry Potter has been growing in age from one volume to the next, and in this volume he really has his age, thirteen. This is the mark of a very good writer who is able to follow the maturity or the maturation of the characters, so that the story is realistic. Never in the four volumes, and particularly in this volume, are the characters older than they should be. Hermione discovers social consciousness and gets interested in the fate of elves, as well as she discovers the difference between friendship and love. Ron Weasley discovers the need to believe his friends and the first pangs of love or sexual awareness. Harry Potter opens his eyes to the necessity to assume his responsibilities by learning what he needs to accomplish his tasks and the sense of honor and human solidarity even within a competition in which he tries, and he is not the only one, to remain human, with his challengers or co-competitors, instead of being an unsensitive and selfish winning machine. This is done with great subtlety and delicacy. Fred and George Weasley are older and they discover the need to have a social and economic position in society that brings in an income based on a creative project for the whole community : this is known as business in any society.<br />The second element is that the confrontation between Potter and Voldemort finally comes to a direct face-to-face one-on-one duel whose stake is life or death for Harry Potter as well as life or death for his direct friends and the whole community. The battle leaves the level of individuals to reach the level of society, a real universal value, a cosmological dimension. And in this progressively built up, and non-final because undecisive as for the life of death of Voldemort himself, frontal shock, the writer shows a level of imagination that has no limits. She uses older elements in an unforeseen or at least partially unpredictable way, and she adds new elements that are totally undeductable from the previous volumes. Suspense is absolute and never, at this level, loosened or weakened.<br />The third element is The widening of the national and ethnic scope of the book. The author introduces a competition that brings into the picture two schools from abroad : one from France and another one from eastern and central Europe. Hence there is a play on the particular « dialects » of those foreigners in their use of English, a play on food variations, on clothing variations, on transportation variations, etc. This is supposed to widen the scope of the students&#8217; consciousness and awareness of the differences that exist between and among humans to bring out a wider accepting of national and international cooperation. But she also widens the scope by introducing several other communities, particularly  some that are traditionally rejected by wizards and witches on the basis or pure prejudice, that is to say racism : merpeople, elves, goblins (a little), giants (only a beginning). The aim is always to show that cooperation between different ethnic groups is necessary to give the future some stability and predictability.<br />The fourth element has to do with political power and its abuses. Power for the sake of power (Lord Voldemort), or for the sake of stability (The Minister of Magic, Fudge), or for the sake of lawfulness (that always covers some unlawful element and some inhuman attitudes to impose the law), or for the sake of personal privileges (like the power to show off, to get publicity, to bet and gamble) leads to abuse and cecity, at least shortsightedness, the incapability to see how the future will change and warp those principles or objectives, those ambitions, those values : to be a real leader you have to keep in mind the unification of your people and the wider longer aims of human life, of social life, of history. Lord Voldemort and his followers find themselves on the wrong side of history, just the same as the Minister of Magic who only wants to protect what has achieved, which is the past, and to prolong it into the future. This idea that the future needs moral commitment and the accepting of change is essential in this book. There is a real mirror in the book that gives us a picture of our own society that uses democracy in order to capture power in the name of change and progress, and then defend it in the name of stability. Any political leader is led to conservativeness, I am even inclined to saying conservation.<br />We thus wait for the next volume that will have to deal with the fight against the revived Lord Voldemort and also with some fundamental issues that have not yet been solved : love and its outcome, the fate of Harry&#8217;s godfather, the need of justice and to avoid injustice or to repair cases of injustice, when injustice occors, etc. We can trust the writer to bring in new elements that will constantly feed the mill of suspense and imagination.and warp those principles or objectives, those ambitions, those values : to be a real leader you have to keep in mind the unification of your people and the wider longer aims of human life, of social life, of history.

As I have previously said this is the greatest book ever.  Because of the Tri - Wizard tournament there is no Quidditch at the school.  In October the two other magic schools Beaxbutons and Durmstrang come to Hogwarts to participate in this event.  You have to be at least 17 to be able to enter but someone enters Harry's name, I won't tell you who though.  In this book Harry finds a crush Cho Chang and so does Hagrid , Madam Maxime.  Harry meets Voldemort again and finds out a few secrets from him and Dumbledore.  The reason for this books length is because of the Quidditch world cup that the Weasley's, Harry and Hermione go to in the beginning.  Not until page 150 do they go to Hogwarts.  They also spend a lot of tome doing the tasks for the tri-wizard tournament.  In the last task Harry spends quite a bit of time with Voldemort.  They also spend quite a bit of time finding out secrets.  So remember buy this book!	2001-08-12

This book has raked up much praise and adoration from the young reading public. The exciting story lines, and exotic characters revolving around a magical setting is what brings in the young readers. However, the complex relationships that Harry entertains with his friends, family, mentors, and enemies are what keeps the mature readers of Harry Potter. This book is seemingly the beginning of what seems to be the &quot;maturing process&quot; of a young boy we have all come to adore. This stage in young Harry Potter's life arouses a bit of nervous feelings for the adult readers because new problems and situations are bound to be introduced to the seemingly very young readers. Perhaps, this &quot;maturing process&quot; will rake in a whole new audience of readers and loose the large fans Harry Potter has already gathered.<br />Personally, I can't wait to see how J.K. Rowlings pulls this off. The raging hormones and erratic teenage behavior ought to be a significant twist to the already innovative plot!<br />This book is the beginning of a new stage of Harry Potter and marks a long period of waiting to see what will happen next...	2001-08-12

Harry Potter reflected the kind of innocence that one would find in a child not yet come in to his own, a Nerd of sorts, whose potentials, and possibilities appear hopelessly lost in his inability to &quot;fit in.&quot; Harry is not initially thought of as &quot;Hero&quot; material with all the goodness, stregnth, and self-righteousness emminating from him.  Unwittingly, and, unwillingly, he is thrust into circumstances by which heroes and victims are created. With unerring intuition, he comes into his own,as a reluctant hero humbled by the price paid by his survival.  Harry Potter exists!  He is everyone who ever felt out of place,unworthy, or, misunderstood.  He is the every day person that gets out of bed to greet the new day with out magic, without expectations, just filled with the determination to have a good day.	2001-08-09

Breaking the rules and showing evolution, this novel illustrates how well rounded a writer Rowling has become.<br />First, this novel, a behemoth with roughly 700 odd pages, breaks the standard Harry Potter rubric.  It begins with a turn for the better.  Our first glimpse into Harry's 4th year is a foreshadowing of Voldemort (er... you-know-who).  All I can say is that I am extremely pleased that the Dursley's weren't my first impression again.  Speaking of which, when they did show up, Rowling finally makes them stomachable again by having the Weasley twins play some nasty tricks on them.  Good show!<br />Second, this installment of the Harry Potter series shows that Harry is begining to mature.  Where the other novels have a rather schoolboyish attitude surrounding Potter, this one shows slight signs of his maturity.  The subtelty of these ideas in the writing shows how truly skilled a writer Rowling has become.<br />Last, the end of the book is, unlike the others, a cliffhanger.  Harry's story is now locked in and has me (and I'm guessing thousands of others) hooked and waiting for the 5th installment.<br />Excellent writing!	2001-08-09

The book starts off with him being woken from a nightmare by his scar hurting. When he returns to school, everything seems almost as normal as usual - or as possible at Hogwarts - apart from people whispering about the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, Hogwarts' Quidditch being cancelled for the Triwizard Tournament, and him (unwittingly) being entered into it. Harry (who has to deal with fame on a new level), Ron (who learns to control the green-eyed monster) and Hermione (who'll dabble in politics) struggle to keep their heads above water and on their necks, as friendships strengthen, and new ones bloom. Many dangers lie ahead, and twists galore unfold. Clearly, Rowling is able to sustain (and even add to) her flare, comedy, and suspense, as another year begins at Hogwarts.	2001-08-05

It was nice to see that book four was 734 pages long, knowing it was the last book before the 'dry spell' while waiting for Hogwarts year 5 to be released in 2002. This book is very juicy in storylines. The book starts out with some very strange happenings at the Qudditch World cup when the Dark Mark is seen.( I won't tell you what the dark mark is or I ruin the suspense!) As most people know there will be no Quidditch this year at Hogworts but to make that up they will have the Triwizard Tournement. They haven't had this event in hundreds of years due to the amount of injuries and deaths to the participants. The suspense continues when Harry somehow gets into the tournament even though he is underage.<br />In this book J.K. also introduced a new character know as Mad-Eye Moody who is the new defense against dark arts teacher who seems to have quite a liking and interest in Harry. As the Triwizard Tournament progress the storylines definelty get much more juicier. As the final event approaches it looks like all the contestants from the three schools are in contention. However the best part of this book isn't until the very very end as there will be a big surprise!!! I don't want to spoil anymore of the book so you will have to read the book! All I can say is after reading the ending of book 4 I can't wait for the return of the Harry Potter books in 2002!!!!	2001-07-31

It feels like a whole new Harry and all different characters, we are strayed away from the descriptive, sarcastic, smart and funny characters we loved in the first 3 books. This is in a way very intelligent but somehow disappointing. The 4th Harry outing is still highly recommendable. The story is shocking and has grown up a lot, this book I would most recommend to teens. Not for the violence or the sense of romance, but more plot-wise. The teenagers will take this in better, the kids may have to have it interpreted by an adult. The book mainly consists of Harry preparing and doing tasks for a big competition, and I found the preparation for the tasks the best bit of the book. It brings out an intelligence in the series that no other book has displayed, while the actual doing of the tasks themselves are great. You feel like you are there, feeling the fire on your neck and been caught up in a web of rush and tension. In the end, all in all, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire succeeds in being a pleasurable and intriguing book for most audiences, but for some it will be a let-down.	2001-07-29

First I looked at these books I thought they were a mindless fad, but when I got around to reading them they were wonderful. This book is the best one so far because we can see the charactors growing up. We see more hidden emotions such as jealousy, and lust.  Some may say the book is violent, but I have another thought. The book is a fantasy book that needs to cling on to reality, and in reality there's violence. To learn virtues about honesty, courage, and loyalty you must also learn that there's violence in the world.  To the parents who are confused about the lack of metaphors and sophisticated language, you have to remember that the charactors in this book are preteens and preteens have little appreciation for such kind of words.

Not the quidditch tournament, but a magic contest between three (international) wizard schools is the red line in the story. She also pays less attention to the obnoxious Dursley family and more to Voldemort.<br />The Goblet of Fire is by far the most thrilling of the four parts. Harry is growing up and his opponents are more formiddable. This book seems to be directed to a more mature audience. Can't wait for part five!	2001-07-24

Whilst on holiday in the south of France, I happened to meet one of the senior executives of Bloomsbury (the original imprint for the Harry Potter series). Having heard the tales of bookshops swamped with excited buyers, I couldn't resist asking him whether it was down to good marketing or good writing. He assured me it was good writing. I believed him and bought all four books.<br />Thanks, David, for your sound advice. J.K.Rowling has, indeed, written a series that is brilliantly simple in its conception yet amazingly intelligent in its portrayal. If you've never read them, you should. Within half a dozen pages, you'll find nothing at all unusual about students of Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry riding high on broomsticks playing a game called Qidditch.<br />Harry Potter is now adored worldwide. So is his creator, Joanne Kathleen (J.K.) Rowling, a single mother with a wonderful imagination and a gift of insight into the minds of youngsters and adults alike. She has the undeniable ability to recall her own childhood and capture those wonderful, though sometimes difficult times. It's an ability that makes her creation, Harry Potter, so easily acceptable.<br />I notice that the Goblet of Fire states 'Reading Level Ages 9-12'. Clearly a misprint. It should be 'Reading Level Ages 9-92'. Eighty years from now, Harry Potter books will be sold as collectors items in boxed sets and todays 12 year olds will still be reading them and reliving their childhoods.<br />If you still haven't read any of the Harry Potter collection, you should swallow your pride and do so now! (They print adult editions with less striking front covers!)	2001-07-24

The growing up of the characters is beautifully portrayed. The sensitivity of early teenage relationship among friends and the sudden realisation of the characters about their and their friends' gender is very well crafted. The storyline holds tight, despite its length.  Now, the not so good things. It is the most sensational of all the Potter books, and I'm afraid it has played to the market forces. Most of the aspects appear to be dominated by the selling factor, overhyping the characters and the situations. The first three books were writen more from the heart and self belief, this was written for the market with the aim of hard selling in mind, forcefully lifting everything to a grander scale. As a result the book loses the innocence present in the earlier volumes. Overall, it's a book that lives upto the series, with its share of new ideas and imagination, making it a compelling read, but it achieves this goal mainly because of the earlier volumes. It keeps up the interest for the next in the series (no.5), but with trepidation that playing to the market forces and falling into the trap of following a selling formulae of a sensational bestseller will spoil the charm of the series. The author should show the courage to write a shorter book for the next one in the series, if necessary, filling unnecessary pages doesn't add anything to the creativity.	2001-07-24

I have given this book one star for just one reason: There isn't a zero star option! I am stunned by the rave reviews this book receives. I have read all four of the books in this miserable series, and have written a review on the first book (my opinion hasn't changed- that review is also a one-star). I'm not planning on spending money on these books anymore. In my experience, many of the people who love Harry Potter are the ones who will read a book only if they have a book report or summer reading to do. These books are for the people whose imaginations are impoverished due to lack of reading. As another reviewer put it, &quot;The adults who like these books are the ones who didn't pay attention in English class.&quot; One other thing I've noticed is that this series should have a subtitle: The Lord Of the Rings. This book lacks originality. J.K. Rowling has tried and failed to write a book as great as The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien. When Harry Potter #5 arrives on the shelves, leave it alone and pick this one up. You won't regret it! Another series of much higher quality are the Redwall Series, by Brian Jacques. Then, when you've finished with them, read the Sherlock Holmes stories, by A. Conan Doyle. Another series to read as soon as possible are The Chronicles of Narnia, by C.S. Lewis. So, forget Harry Potter, and read good books like these!	2001-07-23

Ah, the world of Harry Potter. As usual the wonderful writings of Ms. J. K. Rowling held me under a spell, and I just couldn't put it down. I love the whole world that she's created, and because I'm an excellent reader for my age, I could handle the 4th book. My Mum and my Uncle have both read all the books and i agree with them that the books have become more difficult as the story countiues. But in it all it still remains and excellent novel with a thrilling plot twist. There is so much mystery and intrege, the whole plot is filled with lies, hate and a great many stunning surprises.<br />One thing that I must give to Ms. Rowling above al others is her ability to keep things straight. Despite the fact that she discovered a large whole in the plot, and had to work 12 hour days for 2 weeks in order to finnish the book, JK's good writing skills (and I'm asumming good notes) kept every last detail straight...but I did notice one flaw. The end of the novel when Voldemort and Harry duel. The people and spells that came out of the Dark Lord's wand were supposed to come from the latest one and back. Well first there was Wormtail's hand, followed by Cedric Diggory, The old Gardener, Bertha Jorkins and then here I think is a mistake. First Harry's father came out of the wand, then Lily Potter. Am I mistaken but didn't Lily Potter die after James? So truthfully it should have been Lily and then James. Right? JK's simple and one time mistake perhaps were not noticed by many but I remember that at least. Well I'll excuse the flaw I Loved the book despite this.	2001-07-23

What Rowling does in the beginning is set up the entire story and certain deliciously exciting parts such as the Quidditch World Cup scenes, which are definately suprising and un-put-a-downable. She also sets up the big picture in the book as in previous books, which features a climatic battle with Lord Voldemort, or as in book 3, an unexpected conclusion involving Harry's new godfather, Sirius Black, and the strange character Peter Petigrew. Other reviewers have also stated that the book is too dark and violent. It's dark, but only because Harry is maturing and things getting darker is sometimes what happens, especially in Harry's world, which is one filled with magic, danger, and wonder everywhere you turn. As for the violence, that comes with the darkness and sometimes you just have to deal with it. What else would you do in Harry's place with a menace like Lord Voldemort hanging around scheming and plotting new ways to kill him or use him as he attempted to do in this book? I for one would definately be petrified from fear, but Harry was courageous enough to stand up to the He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and even escapes (several times now), however narrowly, from the evil clutches of Voldemort. So violence is necessary here. Harry can't just let himself be killed. You can wish that Lord Voldemort didn't even tried to do something horrible to Harry, but if he didn't, he wouldn't be the evil archnemesis we know, would he? Besides, it's Rowling's story and so far I think she's doing an excellent job with it. As for the readers complaining that the Harry Potter books are not great in the literate world, I suggest you get checked back into realtiy. Not only are they immensely popular (as were literate greats Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, and Mark Twain, which I'm sure you all know), but are classic in their views of courage, coming-of-age, and when facing darkness. The style Rowling writes in is flowing and easy to follow. She isn't too heavy on description, though still pays close attention to detail where it really is needed. Instead of lavishly decribing Hogwarts or Diagon Alley over and over again as she had before, she elaborates on the character's feelings, which are by far more important. Although this is true, you aren't at all blind in Rowling's imaginative world. All you need is a creative mind, a handful of Rowling's descriptive sentences and you're there, watching the greatest Quidditch match take place, or crossing your fingers for Harry while he makes his way dangerously through the Triwizard tournament, or at the dreadful climatic battle, clasping the book hard as you become afraid to read on yet still wanting to know what happens next. Another complaint of readers was the useless dialouges between characters. They may be lengthy but if you really listen to the characters, you can see them mature right before you. Harry becoming more daring and brave with the Dursleys. Hermoine lightening up or stiffening at the subject of House-Elves. Ron still scared of spiders and considering himself poor, his relationship with Harry becoming shaky and then wonderful again. Their dialouge is not something skip over-most of the story's humor in them! With all these complaints, it looks like readers are trying to &quot;grow up&quot; and are forgetting the captivating magic of the actual story. Who really cares about the technical things or happenings in the book? I certainly don't. I just want a story. A story that will give me characters to love, hate, cherish, care, and want to know better. A story that will give the good characters an adventerous plot they deserve. A story with a delicious style. Rowling has served me that story. I should think that she has done the same for you. Stop complaining. Stop trying to pick at the book and critisize it. Instead, enjoy it like a book shouldbe. If you didn't like it, don't ever read it again. If you miss it, then perhaps you like it after all. If not, fine, but I definately don't want to hear it. I'm sure other loyal Harry Potter fans won't either. I hope this has helped you. I also reccomend the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman.

What little plot there is meanders to such an extent that any narrative momentum is lost. The dialogue is embarrassingly mediocre. The use of metaphor and imagery is rudimentary so say the least. Anyone who has read children's fiction widely over the last 30 years or so will recognise this smorgasbord of tried and tested fictional themes, little of its content being truly innovative or interesting.

One star for the flowing and unique style of writing that the author keeps up throughout the book.  Now, the bad news:  Today's society stinks. Many people have been saying that the violence in Harry Potter books is common. Violence is everywhere. It's on TV, in movies, in the newspaper, in books, and even worse, in real life. I agree that the violence is common (I'm not saying that supernatural violence is common, just violence in general). But I process what people are saying into them saying that violence is acceptable, that today's society of violence is okay and that the violence in a book doesn't matter or doesn't affect anyone. Violence, first of all, is wrong. If people just want to ignore that, fine. Harry Potter's violence is supernatural and sometimes not. But at least there are some good virtues in the book to look up to. Unfortunately, writers these days seem to be saying that we need violence in order to have courage, sacrifice, etc. And we don't. Harry Potter is a fun series about these virtues, but Rowling is really just a mediocre author with a great style of writing that captivates. I have to give her credit for that, but otherwise she's just like any other author who says to me that you need violence to have all those good characteristics. She's also saying that you need magic in order to have power or control. Hopefully there will be a different sort of message in further books. I only took one star off so as to not make people angry. I'm not saying that you shouldn't read this book. I'm just saying that you should read it with a more mature mind. Instead of starting it or restarting it as many people have already with a thought of the book just being a good story or a piece fiction, start it knowing what the book could say to you.

As the series goes on, the Harry Potter books have become darker, and a lot more serious. Harry, who has aged 4 years sense the first book, has grown up. But this \\"growing up\\" may be a bit too fast for most of the series' younger fans.<br />When the first book came out, it was a fairly good-sized book, 250 pages . Now, with 700+ pages, it is beginning to look like a series for older kids. The characters \\"find their hormones\\" as the author puts it, and not only decide to start ... As the series stretches on, characters start getting involved romantically and start cussing, among other things.  But the darkness is surprising and is nothing a thirteen-year old can't handle.  All of the 'maturing' hapening is very realistic, but fans that started reading Harry when he first came out in 1998 at the age of 9, are now only 11 - anid have aged 2 years, relative to Harry's 4, and they may not be maturing as fast as Harry.  Also, the magic takes a slight turn from the 'Cinderella' magic more towards the \\"Blair Witch\\" type.  And of course anyone who grows up looses thier innocence and is exposed to more and more grizzley things - but the problem is that as Harry is growing up, kids aren't growing as fast.	2001-07-19

However, this book turns to some more serious issues, such as jealousy and &quot;rights&quot; and even death.  This book definitely is darker than the other three books.  However, the darker parts of the book do not occur until the end, where Harry views the past and comes face-to-face with Voldemort.

But then, slowly enough, people I knew were reading Harry Potter.  One of my friend's mother's ran out and bought the second book the DAY it came out on hard cover.  She usually heads straight to the library!  Of course, I kept shrugging it off... flipped the channel when the &quot;midnight sales&quot; were on the news, but when I realized I had to read these books were when I was babysitting a while ago.  The young girl I babysit for asked me to read her Harry Potter.  Nights after nights we went through chapters and chapters and pretty soon I found myself looking forward to reading them as much as she was.  Well... eventually, I headed down to the library and borrowed my own copies and read them all.<br />Well THAT's what the big deal was about.  I've never heard of anyone with such an incredably creative and intriguing mind.  The books are ALL just wonderful, intricate, interesting creations.  They go into so much detail about the wizarding world and how things are... and of course about those horrible Dursley's that any respectable Harry Potter fan despises.  JK Rowling created her own little world and then invited us all in through writing these books and I am never one to turn down an invitation!<br />However, for those of you, especially parents, worried about the &quot;satanistic&quot; wizardry, calm your fears, there is nothing remotely satanistic or immoral.  These books show wonderful examples of courage, bravery, comradery and all the virtues you could ever want in your children.  Once you go beyond and imaginative world of wand waving, you get to the pure foundation of the novel.  Friendship, heroism and adventure.  And really, what American or Brit, or any other nationality or religion could argue with that?	2001-07-10

These are well-written, and intensely exciting. Far better to read HP than most of of the other boy-hero books. And the usual lot: Goosebumps and the rest are just a literary waste of time. However, I'm disappointed in some of the more diabolical characters. Be sure to discuss this with your more impressionable children.<br />In all, the Harry Potter books are intelligent. For the kids who think the Babysitters Club or Goosebumps are the best the world, start with Harry. Then work your way over on the shelf to read the Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis, and for real depth of plot and storyline, see JRR Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />Due to the heavy commercialization of the HP books, I doubt HP will make into the ranks of classic books. They'll be, sadly, too diluted with pop-culture to make it. But for today, they'll serve as a nice segue into the classics.<br />Buy it, but with the caveat there are better books in this genre.	2001-07-09

Also, it was not predictable, and the ending wasn't as \\"happy go lucky\\" as the other books had been.  It seems as if Rowling directed this book more so towards the older audience.

It was a longshot, but what was there to lose? To my amazement, not only did I thoroughly enjoy the story myself, but my son was enthralled!<br />Each of the books, as well as having humor and plot, has a number of mysteries. Not only did my son recognize that there were mysteries, he was able in some cases to work out the clues and predict what was going to happen next.

How often can you say that about a book?<br />We've since read all four books in the series, and he wants to read them again. (I'm trying to get him started on the Narnia Chronicles instead.)<br />Now here's the most shocking part. The Harry Potter movie will be coming out this November. He says he doesn't want to see it.

I was right in thinking I wouldn't like them; that was until I started reading the second and then the third. Later, I then read the first which worked out fine. I had massive headaches from the eye strain it gave me to read these adventureous stories full of everything I think this world could use more of. Others have their opinions and I much respect them. I also have my own opinions.  Christians view this book as a way of the spreading of evil and doing it though our children. I read the fourth book the day I got it, and it was the longest book I have ever read and actually enjoyed it. As i set it down, I felt accomplisted and proud.  The ironic thing about my trip was that not only have my grandparents have read and listened to all of the books, but my grandfather is a well-known retired Christian Minister. They enjoyed these books. I loved them myself!! This proves that it doesn't matter what age you read it at or the supposed effect but more what the reader gains from reading J.K.

As a fantasy story-teller about the world of magic, J.K. Rowling has enjoyed remarkable success.  The adventures of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts, the school where young wizards learn the skills of magic, are highly imaginative and thoroughly enjoyable.  It is no wonder that this series has captured the imagination of children and given pleasure even to adults.  Many of Rowling's concepts are strongly reminiscent of the brilliant children's fantasy fiction by Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl, and she likely has been influenced by their work.  But Rowling clearly has a style of her own, and in this fourth book of the Harry Potter series, has confirmed her reputation as a story-teller for children. This novel has all the ingredients of a good children's novel - suspense, imagination, and excitement.<br />The remarkable popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to its author J.K. Rowling being frequently mentioned in the same breath as the fantasy greats J.J.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.  Yet this is not entirely deserved, because the works of Tolkien and Lewis go far beyond the level of story, imparting great truths about human nature and theology on a deeper level. Rowling's books do not have this deeper level, but are simply imaginative books that entertain.  That is not to say that Rowling's novels are not good. They clearly are. The incredible sales record of the Harry Potter series tells its own story of success.<br />The Harry Potter series has been much criticized for the extent to which magic has been incorporated into the story-line, and the increasing interest in the dark side of magic has left people wondering whether Rowling is leaving the door open to the occult.  Rowling herself has publicly denied any personal interest in the occult, and explicitly repudiated being an advocate of the occult or intending to attract children to it.  Most of the magic she describes is clearly fantastic and bears little relation to the magic of the occult.  Yet it must be conceded that there is a growing contemporary revival of the occult, and that occultic themes and ideas are hardly absent from Harry Potter's world, but rather play a key role in it.  When accompanied with an increasingly dark and macabre tone, this element did make me seriously question whether the Harry Potter books are suitable for children.<br />But in the end it is not the magic of Harry Potter that has made it so successful.  The real reason is that readers can identify with its characters. Although Rowling describes a fantasy world that exists only in her imagination and ours, it is clear that this fantasy world is largely a mirror image of our own 20th/21st century Western world. What makes this series so successful, is that we recognize ourselves in the novel - our system of education (Hogwarts), our ideology of human rights (Hermione's fight for the elves), our worship of team sports (the quiddich world cup), our love for competition (the tri-wizard contest), our political world (ministry of magic), our media (interviews with the Daily Prophet), our concern with health and beauty, our fascination with love and guy-girl relationships, and our love of feasting and food (The Yule Ball).  Unlike Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Lewis' \\"Narnia Chronicles\\" which are more demanding and deep because they bear little resemblance to our world, Rowling's world of \\"Harry Potter\\" bears a great deal of resemblance to our contemporary godless world and its idols.  Although \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" is outwardly about a fantasy world, beneath the fantastic trimmings it is essentially about our own world.

Harry Potter does not fit a good book. The Harry Potter books are indescribable. There is no other way to put it. The essence of the books pulls you through an adventure with danger and excitment. The books enchant your mind and soul, building up a mountain of love and joy. The author helps us relate to old memories, reaching back in time to remembering our choldhood. You remember enemies, friends, and in the end, just someone who will always reach out a helping hand.  The books show Harry having hard times,his parents dying,living with muggles,etc. Still showing the hatred of this book, she still shows the good times, just being able to sit down and share memories with friends. I think we can all relate to the Harry Potter books as our own child self inside our heart. I also believe that Harry Potter is not just someone else, but ourselves in disguise, trying to find the right path down which we all shall head. As far as Harry Potter goes, there is nothong more irresistable and refreshing as reading one of J.K. Rowling's books.	2001-06-28

This series was just what I needed! J.K.Rowling introduses new things in the wizarding world(snufflers and tents that have many rooms in it). The book keeps popping up with hints of something important but it is impossible to pay attion to every detail. The defence against the dark arts teacher is very interesting and weird,(how long can J.K.Rowling keep making up new and interesting people)? I spent a waste of time reading one star reviews. Not one of them said something that is relistic or supportive of what they try to say.<br />1. Harry potter is sudenly intersested in girls. That is not entirely correct. Harry has a crush on a Cho Chang. Part of that could be dew to puberty. 2. Harry has no depth(as well as other charaters). I will have to admit that I don't connect with the charaters but thay are very rich in persanalty. Snape flexing his hands every time he looks at harry as if wanting to strangle him, is an example. 3. It is boring and predicatble.  WARNING DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK Can these people honestly say they knew or suspected Crouch's son was alive??? Of course not! He died ater being in prison for a year.Can people say they knew Snape and Karkarof are death eaters??? Of course not! By the way I don't think Karkarof is going to live to see 2 more christmass.<br />I enjoyed this book and hope I can meet someone who does not like this book so I can see if they can support themselves.Harry touching the right thing only at the grandiose climax of the final task of the triwizard tournament was kind of having the bad guys unnecesarily putting all odds against themselves for such a long period of time.  Though they eventually succeeded these supossedly cunning dark minds would get quite low scores in low-risk planning.<br />This said, well this 4th book has definitely many things that deserve the greatest compliments as you can surely see in probably all reviews.  The most intelligent scenario Rowling has conceived so far in these 4 books in my opinion is when Harry is under his invisibility cloak trapped in the stairs in front of Snape and Filch and Moody helps him and finds out about the marauders map.  Only close to the end of the book you realize why this moment when Moody is looking at the map in front of Harry was such a critical one, what was at stake, what was really going on there.  Really amazingly clever. By the way I would bet this map idea of Rowling was probably indirectly inspired by certain computer games, and I also think the magic diary in the second book was probably indirectly inspired by palm computers.  Just guesses anyway.<br />A final comment about the alleged discrepancy in the order in which Harry's parents died.  That could be explained quite reasonably well, though in a tricky way.  We all know Harry survived the killing curse all together.  The &quot;Aveda Kedavra&quot; curse can therefore be beaten.  Now, what happens when it is not beaten?  It seems reasonable to think it may not cause technically instantaneous death.  Voldemort reportedly attacked Harry's father first and then Harry's mother.  It's plausible to think Harry's father may have survived a few seconds after receiving the fatal curse.  (Who knows, before actually dying because of the Voldemort's curse he probably even witnessed Voldemort's downfall when attempting to kill his son after having killed his wife).<br />Well, no doubt fascinating imagination and lessons Rowling has displayed and shared in these Harry Potter books.

(Who knows, before actually dying because of the Voldemort's curse he probably even witnessed Voldemort's downfall when attempting to kill his son after having killed his wife).<br />Well, no doubt fascinating imagination and lessons Rowling has displayed and shared in these Harry Potter books.  Thanks for that.	2001-06-28

Too many plot holes to fall into. Too many cartoonish characters. Too many ridduculous sub plots that seem to be going nowhere. Too many mumbo-jumbo jargon. (Did anyone edit the book?)Anyway, I agree with many readers about how silly the Portkey thing was and how imposter Mad-Eye Moody could've just given Harry a portkey and get it over with. Then there are the cartoonish characters. At the end of the book, when Dumbledore and Cornelius Fudge fought I thought about just how ridduculous that was. Dumbledore is an odd name. So is Cornelius Fudge. Also, both of them are odd and funny characters. They don't seem to be ones to fight about these sort of things. The sub plots within sub plots within sub plots. Hermoine with the house elves. It went pretty much nowhere. Harry and Ron's crumbling relationship. They got all all happy-sappy later, which made the whole thing kind of worthless. Fred and George got bad grades. Their mother gets mad and then is crying for them again. The female characters seem to be doing a lot of that lately. I sort of wish that Rowling would stop trying to be realistic because it's really annoying. Mumbo-jumbo jargon. You know, Rowling, you could've saved a lot of trees from being cut down if you just used 'as if' instead of 'as though'. Sure, it's style but you have style everywhere. The detail felt artificial and tacked on. Harry's adventure with love was strange too. It felt as if Rowling had just thought: oh yeah, Harry needs a crush or something. Overall, it was still a dangerously seductive and addictive book as all Harry Potter books are so Rowling as not lost her touch. The three stars are for that. I truly hope that the fifth, sixth, and seventh aren't as dark as Rowling says they will be because that will mean more arguments between Dumbledore and Fudge to laugh at, more Harry-Ron-Hermoine relationship problems that will be rather annoying, more mumbo-jumbo jargon screaming for an editor, more horrible plot holes that will get deeper and deeper, and more cartoonish characters that will make the over-sized cast seem like an episode of Loony Tunes....nd deeper, and more cartoonish characters that will make the over-sized cast seem like an episode of Loony Tunes....	2001-06-27

The first one was fun because it was new, even when it was aimed to children. The second was simple, and perhaps repeating the formula. The 3rd was great ! A great ending, and a lot of surprises by the way. But in the 4th, as Harry reaches maturity, JKR also does. She is not afraid to raise issues as slavery, racism and the craving for power. Yet, this is a book for kids, but it is also a book for adults. You can learn a lot of lessons for life with it. As C.S.Lewis and J.R.R.Tolkien did before, J.K.Rowling books are growing bigger, better and more mature. I hope the best for Harry Potter, and i wish i would be able to read books about Harry Potter and his 75 birthday. In the meantime, we all will be looking for Voldemort.	2001-06-25

I have to say that when I started reading Harry Potter, I thought they were the STUPIDEST books I had ever seen in my life.  However, after forcing myself to see what the heck everyone was talking about, I tried reading them again-and found myself positively hooked.  The adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck a chord in me, as well as many other people!  Harry Potter is not, as so many think, an 'evil' book...if they think it is so evil, why do they voice their opinion..nobody's forcing them to read it!  But anyway, the Harry Potter books are indeed my favorite..and yeah, I've read more books than alot of people have in their lifetimes.  No exaggeration, there, folks..simply truth..and Harry Potter, I concede, simply takes the lead.  I do expect the Potter fad will go out sooner or later, but there WILL be faithful people who continue to devour the literature of the now-famous J.K. Rowling.  I, for one, am simply IMPRESSED with the fantastic books Ms. Rowling has produced..and delighted by the plot line and complexity of it!  At the end of the Goblet of Fire, the LAST thing I was expecting was for Mad-Eye Moody to be on Voldemort's side...but he was..and to actually find out that the Malfoys supported him...I look forward the fifth book [which, today, I found out is not coming out until ***2002!!!!*** [grrrr.  and a sniff.] and it is my hope that Sirius Black's name is cleared, too..and let Harry have some love and joy with REAL family..it's too bad they don't have a spell to bring back dead people, for I would surely like to meet Lily and James Potter.  Sirius Black is intriguing, and how Ms. Rowling came up with HIM is beyond me..but as I have said, I'm delighted..simply delighted..and also, I REALLY hope Dumbledore is made the new Minister of Magic...cuz Cornelius Fudge doesn't seem up to the job.  Okay, enough babbling...see you all at the Harry Potter movie!  :D  -[as most of mie 'peeps' know me..]Dez.	2001-06-20

My sons are 10 and 7 years old, and I am reading them a chapter a night from Book numbers 1 & 2 in the series.  I'm not sure, however, about Book number 3, and I'm definitely not reading this, Book 4 in the series, to them as they simply aren't mature enough to handle it -- indeed, by the time they *are* mature enough for this volume, they'll be past wanting stories read to them.  That said, I applaud Ms Rowling and her strong ethical stance in this post-modern era.  Like the late Robert Heinlein, she offers guidance in the guise of entertainment and, also like him, does it so extraordinarily well that cash customers are willing to pay despite the didacticism.  Conservative Christians who object to the stage-setting and terminology of the Potter books miss the entire point.  This and the other books in the series are powerful voices in favor of *very* traditional values: courage, honor, compassion, loyalty, honesty, redemption, and just plain human decency.  There's no doubt here about the existence of evil and the necessity to stand aganst it.  Buy it for your young children?  No.  Buy it for your teen-ager?  Definitely yes.	2001-06-16

I thought #4 was a good addition to the series because of the added depth of storyline and the obvious changes occurring within the characters as they get older. There have been a lot of complaints regarding the &quot;darkness&quot; of this book, but I challenge those reviewers to present a scenario that involves the return to power of a Powerful and Evil Wizard that isn't a bit dark! I thought she did an excellent job presenting this, and I also support her decision to kill one of the characters. Life isn't all peaches and cream, sometimes it's dangerous, and I think children realize this better than adults do sometimes. Those children who have lost friends and loved ones may find it easier to cope with their loss by relating to the characters in this story.<br />I did have a few problems with the book, which is why I only gave it 4 stars:<br />1.) Many things, from the &quot;lynch mob&quot; of Death Eaters after the Quidditch World Cup tormenting the Muggle family, to the speech inflections, attitude, etc of the House Elf Winky makes me think the author is copying and making light of the former African-American slavery in America. Winky sounds suspiciously like the author borrowed her character straight out of Gone With The Wind (I don't know nuthin 'bout birthin' no dragons), and the image is made complete by Hermione's mission to free them and everyone else's assumption that they are happiest being enslaved.<br />2.) The author dedicates a lot of energy and righteous indignation to Hermione's efforts to liberate the house elves, and then it just...stops. I guess the girl just got bored of trying to free the slaves. Happens, I guess.<br />3.) Why, oh why, was their an entire tournament of chance involved if all the Imposter Moody had to do was get Harry to touch a portkey? Harry trusted Moody almost from the start, it wouldn't have been that difficult.<br />All in all though, it was a good book that left me wanting for more. Harry is an excellent hero, far removed from typical children's book heros who are the underdogs until the end of the book, when something miraculous happens.

Just the thought of a extraordinary and complex world of magic will blow anyone's mind. The main reason for Harry Potter's great success is that J. K.

The first three books, although not equal, were all fun and imaginative with just enough suspense and adventure to be exciting. This book was simply too dark and disturbing for children, and it bothers me that Harry Potter marketing is increasingly being aimed at children as the books themselves are becoming less child-like.  This book was ridiculously long and sorely needed an editor.  I was very unsettled by the increase in not just bad language, but also unkind talk and thoughts between characters who are supposed to be the &quot;good guys&quot;.  For instance calling one another names, wanting to hit someone because of disagreement, belittling one another, the list goes on and on.  The whole thing just left a bad taste.  Worst of all was the unbelievably cruel and abrupt death of Cedric, surely the most noble of all the characters in this book, including Harry!  Ms. Rowling seems to want to introduce more adult concepts in her books, and I understand that desire, but if that is the plan the marketing should not be aimed at children.  Of course children are more forgiving readers than adults are and the obvious plot holes don't bother them as much.  The most obvious one being, why didn't Mad Eye Moody give Harry a portkey ANYTIME during the school year.  Altogether a disappointing book and yet still a book about characters that my children have come to know and like.  It worked for me to read it aloud to my younger children.  Unfortunately I allowed my eleven year old to read this book before I did.  I've realized that I will no longer be able to let my children read anymore Harry Potter books until I've read them first.  Too bad that parents now need to screen Ms. Rowling's books rather than just enjoy them.	2001-06-11

Rowling is the J.R.R. Tolkien of our generation.  What started out as a whimsical children's series a la Roald Dahl is now veering into darker, but equally captivating waters as an epic battle between good and evil begins to take shape.  I loved this book!  It made me laugh and it made me cry.  (And I desperately want my own house-elf!  Which of course I plan to clothe and compensate!)  As a Christian, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these books to anyone I know.  I believe the good Lord gave us our imaginations to craft just such well-written fantasies and Ms. Rowling has been exceptionally blessed.  The theme of good vs. evil is vital to Chrstian theology, just as it is to these wonderfully written and delightful novels.	2001-06-10

As Harry Potter grows up, he starts to get into more serious trouble. This time he has an even bigger showdown with Lord Voldemort, which he seems to be able to survive only because of his magical background - a magician growing up with the harrowing tales of you - know - who's terrible force would have probably just died of fright seeing him arrise again.<br />We also see how Harry and his friends finally start growing up and becoming teenagers - going to balls, getting interested in the opposite gender... This 'growing' up is accompanied by a darker mood throughout the whole book, which starts out as an incident in the Quidditch World Cup, when Death Eaters (Lord Voldermort's supporters) cause some trouble, and it climaxes as we see Lord Voldermort ressurected, and starts gathering his followers again, even though this event was to be expected since the first book, where we learned about the Dark Lord's tries to grab the sorcere's stone.<br />J.K. Rowling still has the knack of inventing many 'magical' surprises for us, such as aparating and 'splinching' as new magical tricks, quite a bit more information on the dark arts and some history of the events before and after Lord Voldermort has fallen, and of course - we're being introduced to different wizarding schools, and finally understand why Hagrid is so big!<br />The only faults I find with this book, and I've taken off a star for are:<br />1) The plan of fetching Harry Potter by letting him survive through the Triwizard context, and then turning the cup into a portkey sounded a little too complex, and it was hard to guarantee that Harry would even be allowed to compete, and winning seems more improbable - why not give him a portkey in a more simple and direct way when everything else was ready?...<br />2) Hermione's fight for elves' rights started with a big bang, but after a while we stopped hearing about it - why?	2001-05-25

K. Rowling is completely riveting. You can get lost inside another world and you will never want to come back. It is truly a magical experience. When you read it you wander into a whole new universe where you do not have to think about your problems or troubles. You can feel what it is like to be a young wizard and explore so many new possibilities. It is imaginative yet educational at the same time. You can discover new words or learn what to do when your best friend becomes jealous or rude. It is, without a doubt, the best Harry Potter book that J. K. Rowling has written so far. It is completely enchanting and captivating. It makes it seem like anything is possible, even magic. I could read it over and over again and never get tired of it.

I read this book to my 8-year old son and it took us 7 months! The story is fascinating and enjoyable as are the other Harry Potter books, but if you're going to read to your child, I recommend numbers 1 to 3.  This book was 734 pages and when you read only 5 or 10 pages a night, you feel like nothing has happened! In my opinion Ms. Rowling has used far too much detail, such as explaining how the witches and wizards get to the Quidditch World Cup via a portkey. This information was important later, but surely not in such depth. We read the climax twice because Harry relates it in detail to Dumbledore. Many of the conversations were also lengthy without building plot. The story got to be very complicated and some of the vocabulary was also difficult for my 8-year-old to understand. (His favorite is Harry Potter Nr. 3.) It all adds up to a fascinating story padded into an unnecessarily long book.	2001-05-16

The book is the best book in the world.I recomend it to every person.Se los recomiendo es lo maximo. I have read many othere books too and believe me they are nothing compared to Harry Potter books and once you've read them you will see what I mean. I can't wait for books 5,6 and 7. Congratulations J.K. Rowling you are thebest writer there is and your imagination is like a kids mind that lets anything he sees be formed wityh new characteristics and creative and teachable words for us to not only understand but also learn. I am ... very proud of my english and my French is getting better but the books open the gates to creativity and let me say thet if all the books in the world were as good as this one I would change a T.V for a library card any time. But if you buy this book you will have the power to take your childs mind away from T.V and more into fantasy. Believe you should buy the book.	2001-05-06

The Best Yet!	`The Goblet of Fire' is book 4 in the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling.  It is also the largest book to date in this series.  To fully appreciate this one, you simply must read the preceding three.  Book 4 takes a completely different turn from the first three, with an entirely unconventional year at Hogwarts.  In this book Harry Potter get exposed in a big way to the international world of wizardry by first attending the `Quidditch World Cup' and later becoming a part of a very exciting and secret competition between two other wizarding schools like Hogwarts.  The characters from preceding books are in full swing in this one, and as usual J.K. Rowling introduces even more colorful and exciting characters in this edition.  Additionally there is the alarming return of the frightening 'He who must not be named'.  There is nothing quite like the imagination of this author, it is simply wonderful and brilliant.  She really has an incredible gift for capturing the reader in the most unusual and exciting adventures.  This book has kind of a dark and scary ending, unlike the preceding three.  All the same, however,  it sets up the reader with screaming curiosity for the forth-coming book 5.  You will simply enjoy this one as the whole story broadens out to become a huge global adventure, and Harry Potter is the ultimate hero.  This series has a unique way of spanning the generations of readers, and anyone looking for something fun and entertaining to read should definitely dig into this series.  You will find yourself captured like none other with this imaginative and refreshing creation.  Further the illustrations by Mary Grandpre are just right throughout the book to keep you turning page after page.  The biggest problem with this book is that it leaves you ravenously wanting to read book 5, and it has not been released yet!  A remarkable story, and it has me totally captured!  You will simply love it!	2001-04-29

I've heard a lot of criticism about J.K. Rowling's books, but I must say that anything that keeps children reading, and not watching television, has got to be good.  In the US, we constantly see articles about declining literacy rates or the amount of television that an average child watches during the day.  I am ecstatic to see the response from Rowling's books.  I am 20 years old and I have read books one through four, twice.  And just thinking about Harry, Ron, and Hermione, makes me want to read them a third time.  I'm not the only one, either.  My 56 year old father also enjoys them.  He says that they remind him of \\"The Hobbit\\" series by J.R.R. Tolkien, fun and imaginative. And they are just that, fantasy and fun!<br />The thought of anyone thinking that these books somehow condone occults or Satan, seems absolutely ludacrist.  I've always been an avid reader, but these books are just too tempting to pass up.  And I don't mean tempting by the way of Satan.<br />If we really want to \\"save\\" our children from the devil and all other sorts of evil that some people think are associated with these books, let's focus on the people that raise the children, not an author trying to make children happy.  Just think about it, J.K Rowling didn't have to continue with the third or fourth book if she didn't want to.  So many books were bought with the first and second editions, that she could have been set for life.  But instead, she chose to do something that made her and millions of other people in the world happy.  She continued to make us laugh with these books.<br />I've heard so many stories about parents reading these books to their children, instead of watching a TV program together.  Now what do you think that a child will remember more, sitting together in silence watching a rerun of Sabrina or a delightful half-hour of reading with their Mom or Dad?  I think that anyone who has read these books knows the answer to that.<br />I'd suggest these books to anyone, whether you can read them in two days or two years, these books are just too good to miss.her you can read them in two days or two years, these books are just too good to miss.	2001-04-27

At over 700 pages, Rowlings latest installment of the Harry Potter saga could have used some judicious editing. Including almost every character introduced so far and a slew of new ones, this book just has too much going on. From the Quidditch World Cup to the Tri-Wizard tournament, this book bounces from one major event to another with little of the character development that Rowling has become justly known for. More trouble for Hagrid, more problems with Snape, and red herrings abound in this massive tome. The most compelling aspect of this novel is the understanding that Voldemort's evil is a powerful one; it manifests itself horribly in the climax of this tale and reminds the reader that all is not laughs and good times for Hogwart's most famous student. Hopefully Rowling will get back on track with the next installment. Sometimes, less is more.	2001-04-25

It's twice as long as the others, which could not be a problem, but Mrs. Rowling felt that she had to add new messages to the tale, such as the freedom of the poor elves, caught in a slavery sistem by the magiciams themselves, and other allusions about human equality that appeals to me like cheap morality.  Besides, the &quot;surprise effect&quot; (with the adding of new characters and elements) tends to be a routine that, with every new part of the saga, is getting more and more complicated to justify. Other than that, it's interesting. (This review is based on the spanish translation of the book.)	2001-04-24

With all of the hype surrounding Harry Potter, I would bet that many people will pass over these books as nothing more than a fad. That would be unfortunate.  I was one of the people who bought them on a whim. I was taking a friend of mine to the Atlanta airport, when I noticed &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; on the shelf at a bookstore. Knowing that they would fly off the shelves if I didn't grab a copy (I had heard about the book on the news that evening), I bought a copy. Not only that, but I bought a copy of each of them (I'm one of those people who, in the heat of the moment, believes that if I don't get one now, I'll never be able to!)<br />I decided I would give them to my 8 year old niece for Christmas. Now, I heard the stories about how &quot;evil&quot; the books were supposed to be, so I decided to read the first one - just to see. I was HOOKED.<br />I read all the books the week I bought them. I gave my niece a card and $20.00 for Christmas.<br />Sure, these books may be the epitome of mass market publication. And you might get sick of seeing Harry Potter everywhere. But when it comes down to it, the books are good. Ignore the trinkets, the bookends, posters, glasses, stuffed animals and all the hype. Buy the books. take it from this 30+ year old kid - they are every bit as enjoyable as they are made out to be.	2001-04-24

While it starts off in typical zany fashion as the Weasleys fetch Harry to attend the Quidditch World Cup finals, complete with strange traveling arrangements and spells galore, the book quickly veers into more turbulent waters, as the World Cup gathering is terrified by the sighting of the Dark Mark, not seen since the dreaded Lord Voldemort stalked the wizarding world.  To further complicate matters, Harry is inexplicably chosen to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, held between Hogwarts and two other wizarding schools, and finds himself contending with much more than he expected.<br />Older kids and Harry's many adult fans will find &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; to be compelling reading.  This is by far the darkest book in the series, with some extraordinarily chilling scenes (yes, there's even some bloodshed).  Parents of younger Harry Potter fans may want to take a look through the book before passing it on--there is some mild profanity (the d-word and the h-word) and situations that may confuse or frighten little ones, particularly towards the end.  The length (734 pages) may also be intimidating for some kids.  J.K. Rowling, however, is developing into an amazing fantasy writer.  She is obviously aware of Harry's maturing audience, and each book is a little more complex, a little deeper--and ultimately better than the last.	2001-04-22

Like the other three books, the real bad guy, who's stirring things up this time at Hogwarts, is once again a SURPRISE.  Around the second third of the book, everything turns serious and all of Harry's daily life challenges seem less than trivial.  This makes this book have more weight than the others, and i think i am by no means the only one to stay up all night to see what happens.  This book draws you deeper into the wizarding world; it seems that Harry is almost all but losing his ties to the muggle world.  Even so, he is STILL, after 4 years, having revelations about the wizard world.  Good thing he has Ron for a friend...or does he?  There are about 4 or 5 different mysteries going on in this one, some small, some huge (the Goblet of Fire one coming to mind).  Hermione's character is reinforced in this one; her brilliance and loyalty are a big help to Harry, and Harry isn't the only person to notice her good qualities.  If you have read the other books, I'm SURE you can't wait to find out what happens with Sirius, Snape, Cho...Rich in plot, suspensful, colorful characters (each with their different side--McGonagall, strict yet soft; Dumbledore, powerful yet humorous; Snape, &quot;evil&quot; yet...well, there's one mystery that's gonna have to wait for the next book--) and please, read it more than once.

The Goblet of Fire is a magnificent book for several reasons.  First, Ms. Rowling constantly rewards the reader who has read the other three books by mentioning details (and then reiterating the details) from the other books and adding more complexities to the various nuggets of information.  Second, although book starts off a bit slower than the other three noevels, this is due to the richer and more complicated story line (as compared to the other three novels).  The more sophisticated story line should please adult readers as the plot is more complex and eventually, far scarier, than the other three novels.  Don't miss this book!

Words cannot convey the genius of The Goblet of Fire. With every addition to the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling outdoes herself. I don't know how she can top this magnificent work, but I'm eager to find out. The Goblet of Fire has become one of my favorite books, even though I'm 17. I finished this book in 2 days because I just couldn't put it down. Every page was better than the last. Harry Potter is for people of all ages. The plots are so intricate and captivating. All I have to say is read this book and you won't be disappointed. I've read it over and over again and the wait for the 5th book is driving me crazy, but I'm sure it'll be worth the wait.	2001-04-11

'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is a definite exception to this rule. The one thing for me that makes the whole series phenomenon so good is the way that all the books are interlinked together so cleverly. I don't mean that the characters reappear in each novel, although this is obviously true. What I'm talking about is the way if you read each book in the series, you will notice many little details mentioned earlier on spring up at later points in the books. As an example, I give the fact that in book 1, when Harry goes to buy his wand, he is told that his father, James's wand was excellent for transfiguration. In book three, we learn that Harry's father was an animagus, something that requires expertize in transfiguration. There are many other details like this which you will notice if you reread the series. Book four, the Goblet of Fire, in particular is an excellent piece of modern literature. Aside from the cool little references back to earlier books, the best part of this novel is the intense drama and fear that J.K. Rowling expresses in it, more so than has appeared in the first three books. Many people seem to dismiss the Harry Potter books as 'just for kids', but I can assure you that they can be enjoyed equally by adults, on a different level. While kids may like the magic and excitement, adults will enjoy the complexity of the plot and the links which I mentioned earlier on. I have yet to meet a single person, young or old, male or female, who has read this book and not enjoyed it. For those who believe that Harry Potter is anti-Christian, I urge you to read the series before making this judgement and you will see that underneath the surface of witches and wizards lie strong Christian morals. Forgive me is I'm wrong, but I think that Albus Dumbledore, the principal of Harry's school, is supposed to be a metaphor for Jesus and that the loss of the 'Elixir of life' in book one is the symbol of his mortality. Although I'm reviewing 'The Goblet of Fire', I recommend that you read the previous three books first to get full enjoyment of the series. However, having said that, this book can equally stand alone. The only minor quibble I have with this book is the fact that due to its length, it take quite a while to get started; in the English edition of the book, there are around 150 pages of scene setting before Harry even arrives at school. However, all these pages are hugely relevant to the plot and necessary for this story. This really doesn't detract from the quality of the book a great deal and it is still hugely enjoyable despite this.

Read all the books - this one is the scariest	Just in case you're a parent and want to know what all the fuss is about, Harry Potter is a young boy who discovers that he is the orpahned son of two well-respected magicians, being raised by ordinary and brutish relatives. Despite what the few critics say, all the books discuss self-reliance, trust and moral behavior, and sound on various themes resonant with children: loss of a parent, superpowers, and facing fears with courage. Each book describes the adventures of successive years in a magical boarding school, where Harry and his companions are being instructed in magical arts. Harry, who is kind of shy and modest, is an unwitting celebrity beacuse of his deceased parents' status - this is more usually a hindrance than help.<br />In Goblet of Fire, Harry is allowed to compete in a contest to determine the worldwide school champion of magic: Harry is one of the youngest ever to be allowed to compete, which causes accusations of favoritism, and some bitterness from his usually steadfast friends. The plot twists keep the reader interested all the way through the book, and the ending is a shocker.<br />This book is an excellent progression in this series. Don't think of it as reading a &quot;kids' book,&quot; - Harry Potter can appeal to the misfit young adult in us all. As an adult, it would be easy to dismiss J.K. Rowling's excellent and imaginative series as another media creation - were it not for the fact that the books appeal to a wide range of ages, and inspire each reader to use their imaginations and read. Use these great books as an opportunity to share an enthusiasm with your kids, and find out how much you'll enjoy yourself!	2001-03-20

Word of caution - read the first three or you'll never get through this book alive (and why would you want to?Half the fun is being immersed totally in this alternate world of Rowling's). It's one of those books that begs a quick sequel - but Rowling's a hell of a marketer and the fifth installment won't be soon enough in coming for anyone. <br />It's amazing - the deadly serious (literally) problems that Harry encounters in this book are ever so present (nay - increase tenfold is more like it) and yet its still the kind of book a child should read, and even encourages the adult reader to look at it from perspectives that should be had once in a while (we take things way too seriously for our own good after we turn 19).The plot's development tears at the heartstrings of the reader as the scenes with Harry's parents, the death of a rival and the maturing of Harry in terms of love and courage come and go. The mystery of Snape, the powers of Dumbledore, the  horror of the very, very changed world that is presented at the end of the novel is enough to make any follower of this epic just breathe with amazement at the skill of the author in creating a good story.<br />Buy the series if you haven't yet.

It really all depends on if you have problems with your children reading about witchcraft and wizardry. Children should have no trouble determining what is good and what is evil. The first 3 books are great, as far as I am concerned, for any child that can read. However, the fourth book does get violent and darker than the other books. I would not recommend it to any child younger than 13. The thing that's bad about introducing the books to children when they are 7 and 8 years old is that they will zoom through the first 3 and want to get their hands on the 4th one.

Everything fits from the flying brooms to wizard education to sports to dragons.  How imaginative.  And an adult reading these books can look back and remember their first dress-up dance (handled very well by Rowling in book 4) or remember school mates just like Harry and his classmates.  Doubtless, they will also take a moment or two to imagine grown up versions of those classmates, and for those they no longer know, will wonder if they lived up to (or down to) their potential.  And, of course, we all like a good vs. evil story; after all, &quot; . . . decent people are so easy to manipulate . . .&quot; (Book 4), but they win in the end, don't they?<br />Each book covers a year in Harry's life.  One might think this would get boring.  Not so.  The plot of each book is quite different and builds up in suspense until the surprising end.  Each book is also better than the last.  There is politics, humor, sadness, fantasy and a poison pen reporter (another imaginative wonder) in these books.  Rowling and Harry Potter has boys and girls (and adults) reading again.  That alone is worth 5 stars!!	2001-03-11

I like the way Ms. Rowling is adding a darker tone as opposed to the cheerful beginning set in the first three. There are moments of sheer terror, but it makes the story telling exciting and unforgettable. <br />  As I read the Goblet of Fire, I began to notice the set up for the final three books that will conclude the series. I throughly enjoyed reading the Goblet of Fire, for a nineteen year old that's quite a surprise. I'm looking forward to book five, the Order of the Phoenix, as we can tell that the story will surpass any predictions about its plot.	2001-03-10

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a very intriguing book with many well thought out characters.  Th plot is amazing with many twist and turns to leave you gasping for more.  This is truly a masterpiece.  One of the best fantasy novels since the Lord of the Rings.  The plot combines all the major aspects of a wonderful novel in to one, such as:  action, fantasy, mystery, suspence, betrayal, horror, and almost every other aspect you can imajine.  The book starts with The Quittich World Cup.  Something very strange happens there.  The dark mark is cast!  The dark mark is the sign of \\"you know who\\" and this time he may be back!  It is Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts and there is a very special activity planned involving three ancient wizardoing schools that hasn't happened for centuries.  The Triwizard Tournament.  Do these strange accurances have anything in common?  Is this some master plot to kill Harry?  The only way your going to find out is if you go and read it.  If you havent read the first three yet, turn of your computer right now and go get them!!!  Other wise, order this book asap!!!	2001-03-09

We've done so in an unusual manner -- I read them aloud to her (it started when she had a severe migraine and her head hurt too badly to let her watch TV or read).  Our reading has followed a pattern: we slowly pick through chapters for the first third of a book, as Rowling gathers all the strings from the previous books and gets the kids back to Hogwarts, then we pick up speed as the plot picks up.  We usually read the last third of the book in a day.  Goblet of Fire was no different.  The first third was (for me) the best beginning to a Harry Potter book yet, and the pace stayed swift from the first page to the last.  We read the last 200+ pages in one night, finishing around 2am.  Work the next day was not fun.<br />Absolutely amazing writing, brilliant characters, well thought-out plots, tremendous written imagery.  This is the best book yet -- darker than the previous books, but the difficulties faced by Harry and his friends are well constructed and the very sad ending is a powerfully done piece of writing that speaks volumes about good and evil.  It also shows some of the powerful potential within Harry, and what his parents must have been like during Voldemort's reign.  (By the way, we now have more reason than ever to say that it's a BAD idea to mess with Dumbledore.)  I look forward to book 5.	2001-03-04

It seems that they have no Defence against Dark Arts teacher and Professor Moody (a.k.a Mad Eye Moody) is just the person to fill the position.  This year the tri-wizard tournament is taking place and so Hogwarts and 2 other schools get together at Hogwarts and begin the cerimony.  Now usually, three names come out of the hat, but this time a fourth came out.  Of course, it had Harry Potter on it.  Thus Harry must compete with the others to win the tournament and stay alive, but with voldemort in the backround watching.... how long will harry last.

Kind of like the FDR of the series.<br />I stand by my earlier reviews of previous Harry Potter books when I wrote that Rowling writes with the growing perception of an aging boy. In this fourth volume, she sees the world more fully and through older eyes than previously. Harry is growing and so is his world.<br />This is one fine piece of literature. Rowling sets a stage early in a way reminiscent of some of the great horror writers of the times. And this book is less fantasy adventure as it ends up being horrific. In one of the longest climactic sequences I've read in ages, she unfolds her plot's essence and sets the monsters loose and you just can't help reading it. You can't stop. And why should you?<br />All the things you want to happen in this book actually happen. Harry shows hints of his greatness. The only thing that happened that I didn't like was that it ended.<br />I am continually impressed by the scope of the Harry Potter novels as well as Rowling's remarkable ability to realize an epic vision. But the previous three were complete with more or less definite closure. Not so here. This one will have you swimming the pond or crossing the country or flying the Edinburgh and knocking at Rowling's door demanding book five. I understand it's due out in 2002.	2001-03-02

It sets the stage for the rest of the book, with  Harry's Dream in which he sees Voldemort planning to kill him, The Death Eaters returning and making sport of muggles and the Dark Mark which is mysteriously fired into the sky at the World Cup.<br />Now, I have to ask you: if all these strange thing hadn't happened would you be excited of Viktor Krums Arrival? Would you find anything wrong with Bertha Jorkins disappearance? Would you have even the SLIGHTEST idea who they were talking about when they said Mad-Eye-Moody? I think not.<br />For all of those people who haven't read the book yet, try not too think things like &quot;this is sooo boring&quot; or &quot;I'm never going to finish!&quot; because J. K. Rowling never includes anything that dosen't have a purpose in the plot, and if you think it is a bit boring at the beginning then just keep slugging along until you get past the stuff that was boring you to death for I can ASSURE you that it is very interesting once you get past the opening of the plot and into the school year with pesky reporters, Jolly Ministry Members and House Elf protests.<br />I guess all I can say is that whether you thought the beginning was good or not there is no question that the bulk of it was funny, lively, and entertaining.	2001-03-01

There he finds out the Quidditch cup had been canceled (don't groan).  Instead, they would take part in the Triwizards Tournament, in which one wizard each from three different wizarding schools: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang, take part in dangerous tests of skill.

Ever since Voldermort has wanted revenge.<br />At school, Harry's best friends are Ron Weasly and Hermoine Granger.  This year, everyone finds out that a Triwizard tournament is to be held at Hogwarts this year.  In this tournament, three schools choose one champion who compete against each other in three tasks.

Each of the four champions have to successfully complete three tasks in order to win.  Harry completes the first two tasks with flying colors along with his other opponents.  The last task is to navigate through a meandering laberynth and fend off dangerous creatures.

Spot any child ranging from the age of 8-80 sporting a grin of satisfaction with a near constant bulge in their breast pocket, and I'd lay money on the nose they've discovered Harry Potter!  The justly applauded author, JK Rowling with a delicious sense of adventure wrought by a playful imagination has already skipped through 4 volumes delving with us by ingenuous invitation into many  sensitive life issues in her locus mundi of a school for wizards.<br />Let's look at Harry - a little boy through whose character she deftly reaches out to children who have the experience of not being appreciated or feel estranged from the families in which they live.  He can be accurately described as lacking nurture within the domestic situation in which we initially find him, sharing a sub-urban house with sub-zero affection from his aunt and uncle and their grotesque son Dudley (&quot;Dudders&quot; as he's `wazzumly' known by his shriek of a mother). Forced to exist in a cupboard in their house, subjected on a regular basis to the family's histrionic and impassioned put-downs of his natural parents, the death of whom has orphaned him into his present circumstances, things look pretty grim for little Harry.  We observe nevertheless his determined if slightly framed form somehow  maintaining its grip on life in spite of his pristine aunt's viewing him as her receptacle for scraps, while the ghastly Dudders force-fed by mummy's infatuation founders of course on to colossal proportions.<br />In spite of these tough beginnings it becomes gradually and comically revealed however, that Harry Potter is a pretty special little boy and the specialness in him radiates out until it's unmissable to a few other talented people, who when the time is right facilitate the changes to bring his qualities the support they need and his destiny starts to unfold.<br />Prevalent throughout the book is the theme that even though we all have special qualities, in the world of the 'muggles' (humans who have no connection with magic or imagination), our special qualities might well be not related to.  Through the world of wizardry, Harry expressing discomfort rather than arrogance about his personal recognition from knowing too the pain inside being the &quot;famous&quot; Harry Potter, slowly gains life experience and a sense of self-empowerment, which in order to meet his destiny he must embrace fully.<br />As the books progress the author gets even stronger at presenting unpredictable but plausible turns in the plot, which certainly satisfy adult readers and children alike.  The &quot;owls are certainly not what they seem&quot;, to borrow a Twin Peaks metaphor, and there are certainly plenty of owls flapping excitedly here.<br />Within the context of wizardry she explores quite centrally the inhumanity and suffering that develops from the divisive judgements used by one group within society towards another.  Implicitly critical and illustrating of the snares within characters enmeshed in these choices, without proselytising or polemic she allows the reader's own sense of compassion and fairness to assess the issues.  A point of pivotal significance being the fascistic persecution by the dark lord's supporters of the half-breed children who come from mixed muggle/wizard background polluting their concept of the 'pureblood' aesthetic.<br />We smile with affection as Hermione, Harry's earnest and affectionately pilloried swottish best girlfriend, starts to take up with zeal the banner against slavery with her campaign for the freedom of house elves. She establishes an organisation called &quot;SPEW&quot; in this cause. The book also explores the value and enduring qualities of friendship.  The feelings which live on beyond the pitfalls like jealousy and such which may rock friendship for a time, but which are eventually and gratefully overwhelmed by its loving bond.<br />Hogwarts (Harry's wizard school world) definitely accepts that all human life is there.  The problems of humanity are clearly demonstrated and explored  using the device of a 'forest of Arden' perspective to encourage the reader to actually take a reasonably searching look at themself. The dark lord and his supporters are balanced by the wonderful Albus Dumbledore who makes the crucial point to one Cornelius Fudge (Fudge by name and a 'fudger' of the truth by nature): &quot;You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so-called purity of blood! You fail to recognise that it matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be!&quot; It is this clarity that makes Dumbledore the one adult wizard  feared by the dark lord.<br />So, Harry goes on growing up and the more his qualities proceed to develop and shine, the more goodness he attracts to himself at his times of need. Also goodness then starts to radiate further from him spreading its contagion equally to those he comes into contact with.<br />In short it's a lovely developing story, just made for bringing the best out in folks - big kids and little kids alike.<br />I would quite like to discuss it with a 'little' kid and see how they find it compared to my 'big' kid perspective.

Rowling has done it again with HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE.  I have enjoyed every book in the series and Book 4 is no exception.  One could compare Rowling's work favorably with C.S. Lewis' NARNIA CHRONICLES and Susan Cooper's under-appreciated series THE DARK IS RISING.  This is fiction for children which is engaging and enjoyable for adults as well.  <br />One of the things I appreciate most about Harry Potter is that he is growing up in these novels, and like many of us, his coming of age will not be entirely pleasant or successful.  Granted, occasionally things are slanted a bit in his favor, and it would perhaps be more honest if the evil characters in Rowling's books were evil due to outside influences rather than their own personal wickedness, but I rarely find myself thinking about such matters when I'm actually reading the books.  Harry Potter's struggles and discoveries are what make these books magnificent; the wizardry element is just a bit of fantasy that spices things up at times.  After all, what child (or adult) wouldn't want a broomstick that could make you fly?<br />THE GOBLET OF FIRE dragged out a bit at times, which is why it doesn't get five stars, but make no mistake, the Harry Potter series books are definitely worth reading, whether you're 12 or 92 years old.	2001-02-13

Still I kept turning the pages, desperately wanting to know what was going to happen next.<br />Rowling introduces plenty of new characters - Professor &quot;Mad Eye&quot; Moody is a really welcome addition - and continues to flesh out such familiar ones as Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, and - of course - Harry, who at fourteen is starting to come of age.  This novel also features the rather horrific - and I suppose inevitable - death of another fairly major player.<br />Rowling continues to impress me with her seemingly limitless creativity.  I continued to be surprised and delighted ... and also rather repulsed by some of her less savory characters and incidents.

I've thought about it for a long time and have come to a few things. There are many things to enjoy in the book such as the Quidditch World Cup, the Triwizard Tournament, and the compelling ending. But this book isn't without flaws- such as, why didn't Lord Voldemort try returning to power in the previous books instead of trying to kill Harry all the time? He did try in the first book, but it didn't have much to do with Harry till the end. Also, with Harry and the other kids at the age of fourteen, the all too little bit of romance in the book wasn't realistic. I mean, people might not start having romantic relationships until that age, but what about romantic thoughts? Another thing is the 'coincidences'and long explanations. The 'concidences' such as how Lord Voldemort could've risen again without Harry, made me think about how J.K. Rowling could've improved in that spot. Also, the lengthy and complicated plan of using the Triwizard Cup could've been shortened to something by far more simple and perhaps more effective- Lord Voldemort could've killed Harry then. But of course, there are three more books to go and many more possibilities. And maybe more narrow escapes, if J.K. Rowling keeps on writing with her formula of 1. The Dursleys, 2. Out of the Dursleys, 3. At Hogwarts, 4. Danger brews along with mysteries remaining unsolved, 5. Mysteries solved in lengthy explanations and an apocolyptic end battle. But knowing Rowling and her knack for suprises, that might all change in book five, six, and seven, which are expected to be much darker than ever. Some ways Rowling could improve is by using a different story format instead of just sticking new stuff in the old to make it look new; develop the characters a little more (Harry, Ron, and Hermoine will be turning fifteen!; and make Lord Voldemort more of a bad guy and actually give him realistic or at least interesting motives instead of insanity for doing bad things. On the other hand, there were some very valid good parts of the book. For example, J.K. Rowling's skill for suprises kept people quessing. Although, most of the characters seem to be thinking that the same person (or sort of person) was behind it all, instead of thinking deeper. There was also the fact that all the characters are very unique (though perhaps underdeveloped). So for all these various reasons, I rate Harry Potter #4, four stars. Humor and suspense did make up for a lot, but I'll be keeping in mind these points and flaws as I await the fifth book and eventually read it.esting motives instead of insanity for doing bad things.

During the first week of my first grade, I fell sick. I had to remain at home for over three weeks. I was very sad, because I didn't want to be left alone while all the other kids were making their first contact with the school and its numerous secrets I had heard so much about (teachers, homework- yes, I was a very naive young boy). Wishing to cheer me up, my mother decided to read me The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, the first of the Narnia series. This was one of my first contacts with fairy tales. Each morning, I woke up, looking forward to hearing the adventures of Lucy, Peter, Susan and Edmund in the magical land of Narnia. I still remember the introduction of the book written by C.S. Lewis. It said: \\"Dear Lucy, I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that girls grow quicker than books. As a result, you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But some day, you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it and tell me what you think of it\\". I didn't understand it then, but it seems so crystal clear to me today.<br />When I first heard about the huge \\"wave\\" caused by Harry Potter series, I didn't pay much attention to it. True, I heard that children and adults all over the world were crazy about the little nerdish like boy and his friends, but I remained too deaf to hear. I couldn't understand how older people could be so fond of this Harry Potter guy? Although I'm an avid reader myself, I decided to ignore the critics and to stick to my \\"serious\\" reading, which usually revolves around historical books, biographies or mystery novels. Then, during my recent trip to New York, as I was walking along the snowy streets, I came by a second-hand bookshop. I entered (I couldn't resist such a temptation). I was perusing various books when I came by Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts, \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\". Let's give it a shot, I told to myself. I bought it, and I ADORED IT! Indeed, to my surprise, it turned out to be one of the best books I've read this year. It has it all: adventure, mystery, friendship, courage and betray. J.K Rowling managed to bring the fairy tale to our own world. While C.S. Lewis introduced us to the magical land of Narnia, Rowling enables us to examine our familiar surroundings through a magical gaze. All the matters that we have to cope with in our everyday life, as children and later as adults, can be found in Rowling's books: on the one hand, love, friendship, hope and courage, and on the other, hatred, racism, discrimination and death.

It brings out the good within each one of us. I look forward to reading the rest of Rowling's books. Keep on the good job!	2001-01-29

I enjoyed the three novels that preceded Goblet of Fire, but while reading this one, I just kept chuckling to myself as I realized that millions of dynamic young minds are absorbing the lessons in this book. As kids read and re-read this delightful story they learn to distrust sensationalist news media (Rita Skeeter) as well as people in authority (Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge) who willingly turn a blind eye to the unpopular truths that threaten their positions, ally themselves with malevolent forces (the Dementors) when convenient, and intentionally whip up public hysteria and prejudice to marginalize minority groups (giants and half-giants).  Much thanks to J.K. Rowlings for working all of these lessons in conscious autonomy into such an engaging and entertaining narrative.	2001-01-28

The editing is tighter, the focus more detailed and the pace faster. Still, the writing remains accessible to kids, as it is simple, economical and visual.<br />Rowling's imagination is first-rate, literally conjuring up all sorts of magical creatures and aptly-named people (each with their own personality). She also creates some delightful plays on words, particularly in her use of Latin morsels of words for spell names.<br />&quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is not just longer than previous instalments but is more serious (dealing with themes of love, death, friendship and betrayal), darker (with more liberal and graphic violence, particularly towards the end), and sinister (evil on the upsurge; no simple &quot;good wins&quot; ending). It is much like the &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot;, a darker, more intricate and more severe part of the series that fills out the backstory and provides many new plot twists. The next few books promise much.	2001-01-27

The series of books has renewed my faith in kids and their appetite for good storytelling.  Harry Potter is a likeable character.  Despite rather dire circumstances, he doesn't mope and feel sorry for himself.  A rather desirable role model for kids.  The magical world woven by the author is imaginative and utterly compelling.  This book is long, and almost feels like two stories - Harry's summer and adventure at the Quiddich match before school starts and then his adventure at school and competing in the great contest.

This was, by far, the best out of the four. I am, for one year, studing abroad in china. I'm not sure if the 5th one's come out yet, but of the first four, this exceded all expectations i held for it. I am 13, and just reccently started reading in large quantities; this was the book that really got me started. I was very happy to hear that this book was going to be a long one, little did i know, for at the end of all three of the others, i was left wanting more. 734 pages! I haven't seen the book in 6 months; it's still in Akron, ohio, on my bedside table, and i remember the page numberof that book, not only because it's a fairly easy number to remember, but because i find myself, decussing harry potter facts with my english teacher, that i remember loads of facts from this book, and i believe that's because everything in that book was amazingly interesting. I found myself, in my last days in america, staying in my room, for hours at a time, reading the stories of harry and his friends. Most of all, i would have to say i liked the way that every single event 'kept me on my toes'. ... Everything within this story was interesting; not in a think it's interesting and forget about it 5 minutes later kind of interesting, but in a kind of interesting where you actually set the book down (how ever hard that is to do), and think about that event by itself, for however long you what, for know one could ever get tired of thinking of the events. I liked how the different charactors from different cultures interacted with each other, whether in helping one another, or ploting against each other with all their strength. These ar emy reasons for giving this book 4stars.	2001-01-21

When I finished the last page of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', I could only close the book and sit stunned. I am 16 years old and started reading Harry Potter out of my own curiosity. I finished the first three within two weeks and it did not take me long to figure out that these were no 'kid' books as I had thought.<br />Before I even began to tackle the monster fourth novel, I already knew that Rowling had cast a magical spell over me with words. I prowled through the halls of Hogwarts with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I zoomed through the skies on my Firebolt. I avoided evil professors such as Snape. I won't spoil the plot of the fourth novel for you, but Harry and Voldemort meet to duke it out again. And it's far far more serious than anything that has happened so far.<br />Although the book was 734 pages, I never got bored and I never wanted it to end. Considerably darker than the easy-going first novel, 'Goblet of Fire' delves into the more complicated themes of good vs. evil, self-sacrifice, and forgiveness. A word of warning, though, if you have not read the first three novels upon reading this book, you will not enjoy it to its fullest extent. The connecting plot structures between the different books are absolutely astonishing. I can't wait for book five.	2001-01-18

This is the thickest volume so far in the series of adventure of Harry Potter, and what an adventure it is! J.K. Rowling returned to her best form in taking us through the magical world of Harry Potter. Personally, I felt that the first three books were too similar and if J.K. Rowling would continue the same formula in the fourth book, this outstanding series might lose my interest. It appeared that my worry was unjustified, though, because while there are some familiar events from previous books, most of the events in this book are new and more exciting than ever. Now that Harry was four years older than when we first know him, he started to develop teenager's problems, e.g. love and jealousy. While the most of the book is delightful and contains some of the funniest events in the series (ballroom dance came to my mind), the last part of the book also contains the darkest, most thrilling moment of the series so far. All of the characters in this book are interesting and less stereotypical. Overall, if you are a fan of Harry Potter, this is a must-read. If you're disappointed with the 2nd or 3rd book, then this one might renew your faith in the series. Now I can't wait for the next sequel!	2001-01-16

Though this is easily the meatiest of the Harry Potter series at over 700 pages, I ripped through it in about six hours -- this is keep-you-up-at-night, extraordinarily engrossing reading. The excitement extends from the fact that Ron and Harry are beginning to notice girls to Harry's vision of his parents (I'll try not to say more for fear of spoiling).<br />My favorite part of this series -- which I began reading on a lark at Christmas to see what all the fuss was about -- is watching Harry Potter *grow up*. I'm 22, and I can remember reading series like *The Baby-Sitter's Club* and *Sweet Valley High* where the characters were eternally eighth graders and high school juniors, respectively. It's completely refreshing to see Harry mature and confront ever more difficult aspects of his past as he gets farther through Hogwarts, yet the fun of the series is absolutely not lost.<br />I'll be first in line, or at least fighting for that position, the day we get to see Harry turn fifteen and start another year.	2001-01-14

What really stands out is her deft touch of humour; her intensely involved plots (of which this book 4 is a stellar example, it is amazing to compare it with the preceding 3 books - it is so much more controlled and water-tight, no loose-ends, considering how complex it was); and her effective way of evoking emotion at crucial points of her story eg. Harry's longing for his parents is a constant theme, and concepts such as love, loyalty and friendship are explored.<br />All the criticism regarding witch-craft surrounding the Rowling mystique are quite laughable.  Magic is the subject-matter of the book - to complain against the Harry Potter books is to complain against the a large proportion of the whole genre or fantasy as a whole.  Are we to be deprived of such imagination and fiction on the basis of religious intolerance?<br />I was struck by the level of &quot;darkness&quot; in the books, but it tends to be gross (descriptions of Voldemort are pretty grim) and not violent for violence sake.  In fact the death of Cedric Diggory was dealt with in one of the more humane ways I have seen death dealt with in recent examples of media.  It is not taken lightly in the book.<br />All in all, I am left anticipating, with millions of other readers, Book 5!  Keep up the good work, Ms. Rowling.	2001-01-14

Now after having read them, I still think it is a bit silly (have you SEEN some of the tie-in products), but I can understand how it got started - the Harry Potter series is terrific.  My sister got the first book for Christmas, and since I was curious about the whole Harry Potter thing, I decided to see if they lived up to their hype.  Without a doubt, they blew my expectations away.  These books are addicting - I just went and bought the fourth one since I couldn't get it from the library fast enough.<br />  I enjoyed the fourth one as much as I enjoyed the first three.  While it is quite a bit longer than the others, it didn't feel drawn-out as I was reading it  (though I agree that it easily could have been 200pgs shorter w/ everything of importance still in it), and the ending was incredible.  It is annoying though that it will be a fairly long wait to the next one (especially since I read the first 4 in 2 weeks).<br />  As for objections that these books are anti-Christian and promote witchcraft, I feel they are unfounded.  While I understand this view - the Bible is rather clear in prohibiting witchcraft, as their &quot;magic&quot; is from Satan - this type of magic is not anything like that in the book.  The magic in the books is very similar to the Force in Star Wars - a power wholly unconnected to any deity(in fact most likely created when the universe was created) - where some individuals have the ability to use the power and choose for themselves whether they will use it for good or for evil.  The magic used by Rowling's characters and the magic prohibited in the Bible are entirely different, IMHO, and only have the misfortune of sharing the same name.	2001-01-08

The book starts out well enough, without the usual dribble at the Dursleys', but it dragged on way too long.  I also disliked the fact that Rowling seemed to condone slavery.  When Hermione starts lobbying against the slavery of the elves, she's a joke.  Harry and Ron just laugh at her and convince her that the elves LIKE to be slaves.  What kind of message is that?  The dance was also unsatisfactory because Harry didn't even do much with Cho.  This book was supposed to be the beginning of his romantic life, and yet he's still completely inexperienced.  Some aspects were interesting, like the three tasks, but the ending left me wanting more.  It seemed to be too abrupt, if you can believe that about this 700 page book.  Anyway, I'd say that the book's content didn't merit the frenzy, but if you want a cute distraction...	2001-01-08

He is a wizard and attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

This particular book continues into Harry's fourth school year at Hogwarts, a wizarding school for young wizards and witches.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes the reader to the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous event with dragons, mazes and other surprises. An underage Harry is entered in the contest and must compete with other wizards from rival schools. Harry ends up meeting his old enemy &quot;you know who&quot; in a terrifying dual of wands and magic.  What makes this book best selling is the author's imaginative and inventive style - her fascinating characters, made-up vocabulary, and clever inventions. One really neat character is Hagrid who was kicked out of Hogworts and now lives on the edge of the school. Harry and his friends visit Hagrid and find out all sorts of interesting facts about the school including teacher rivalries, old friends, and other mysterious trivia.  JK Rowling displays her creativity with her fun invented words. Muggle is one of the coolest word because it is what we are, humans. Some other fun to say words are Hufflepuff, Slytherin, Gryffindor, and Ravenclaw, which are the names of the rival dorms at Hogwarts.  Another word that has a great name and meaning is Omniocular, an invention in which  &quot;you can replay action ... slow everything down ... and they flush up a play-by-play breakdown if you need it&quot;(93). These wizard-like binoculars are used to watch Quidditch games (wizard's rugby).  Rowling's imagination goes on and on with other magical inventions including flags that sing songs, invisibility coats, dragons, and magical candy.  Along with the good vs. evil theme seen in previous Harry Potter books, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has a theme of loyalty. Harry, Hermione, and Ron's friendship was one of loyalty. For example when Hermione and Ron got into a fight, Harry helped them become friends again. Harry's relationship with the house elves was also a loyal one. Harry offered to reward their service of cooking and cleaning with pay, but they didn't believe that house elves should be paid. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of those rare books that any muggle would enjoy! Rowling's creativity with her characters, made-up vocabulary, and inventions would appeal to readers of all ages. From flying broomsticks to portkey transportation this book is the way to go.got into a fight, Harry helped them become friends again. Harry's relationship with the house elves was also a loyal one.

I first began reading the Harry Potter series more than a year ago after learning that kids were abandoning video games and TV to read. It must be good, I thought, but what could it possibly offer adults? But I loved the first three books and reserved a copy of Goblet of Fire two months before it came out.<br />I won't address the plot points, etc. because the other reviews have done that so well and because I want to make a different point: Adults should read this book. This book, Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts, is wonderful. And, it is appropriate for children AND adults. Adults need to stop sneering at Harry Potter. The story and vocabulary are not beneath any reader. (Rowling uses words such as &quot;unctuous&quot; and &quot;sycophantically,&quot; words I didn't know until college.) So adults get over it, and give it a try.	2001-01-04

I've liked all of the books, but this one is my favorite so far. It starts out in the Riddle house, a change from the beginning of the first 3 books, which seems to signal that this book is darker than the others. From there we learn that Harry has been invited to the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasleys, which provides for comic relief as the wizards try to act like muggles. The plot moves fairly slowly throughout the book, but continues to flow nicely.  The only places it seems to stumble are with Hermione's battle to free the house elves (I still don't really see the point behind that plotline) and the lengthy fight between Ron and Harry.  The ending felt rushed in some places, but also seemed to take forever. All in all though, this book is definitely worth your time to read- no matter what your age. I just hope the 5th one comes out soon.	2001-01-03

But you know what they say you should always try to keep up with what your kids are into.  Well.. it sounds like a good excuse anyway.  I finished it the first day after it came!  Personally I think this one is the best so far.  (I had to check the others out - too).<br />First off,  be aware this is a hefty one.  Over 700 pages.  It reads very quickly and is full of not only great action, but more cerebral action as well.  We find out a bit more about some of the standard characters - Hagrid's background for example. We also learn more of the wizarding community in general. And of the schools and their methods specifically (in more ways than one)<br />Rowling is doing a great job of developing the characters as the books go on.  Harry and Ron are growing up some.  They're even sort of beginning to notice girls. My only critique is that Harry  never seems to be in the wrong nor does he lose.  As she is making other characters more and more realistic,  Harry seems to be becoming less and less so.  She still keeps a fair balance of his insecurity there, but he is becoming somewhat over confident and more than a little spoiled.  (I'm sure Snape would be more snide about it,  but he essentially is beginning to sound correct sometimes.)<br />Incidentally,  after I &quot;checked it out&quot; for my daughter, she also sat down and read it stopping only when we forced her to eat, sleep, play.  She has since read it 2 more times.  So if nothing else I would recommend this book on the basis that if it can hold a 7 year old's attention like that in spite of it's size and my criticisms, Rowling is obviously doing something right.	2001-01-03

It gives me a sigh of pleasure and a smile after finishing it.<br />J.K Rowling has made a great move by doing a triwizard tournament in this 4th book, avoiding another quidditch tournament that would appear to be redundant. Also the introduction to other magical school around the globe has given this book another spark and open up a whole big possibilities of what will be coming up next in the 5th Harry Potter.<br />This book has also give more personal touch to some of the main characters which was lacking in the 3 previous books. It is very lovely of how the book pictures Hermyone, Ron, Fred, George, Percy, Longbottom, and several other in more vivid way.

Reasons why I didn't like this book as much as the others 1. It could have been about 400 pages, but so many unnecessary subplots and repetitions required about three hundred pages. 2.

It took the surprise away. But there wasn't any surprise because I new Rolling wouldn't have the guts to kill of an important character.  3.Voldemort is like your typical bad guy. Just plain old bad. He plots to kill Harry in most difficult way and as always is foiled. I wish Rolling had killed him off in the second or third book and introduced new villians.Also the plot is getting too childish for me. I ask myself questions like &quot; shouldn't magic people be ignorent if all they know is magic?&quot; all the time. 4.

I have a renewed respect fo JK Rowling's talent as a writer - not for her plot or her imaginative universe, but her simple ability to construct an elegant sentence. Reading out loud is a tremendous test of that aspect of a writer's craft. Both the Philosopher's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets are a pleasure to say. I cannot say that. however, of the Goblet of Fire does not. Rowling's prose is noticeably more leaden and convoluted. It is weighed down with unnecessary modifiers. There are thickets of uninteresting incidental details which get in the way of the plot's progression. This is a far less \\"writerly\\" effort. I wonder whether the demands of the publisher's schedule became overwhelming, for it feels verily like the sub-editing stage has been skipped on this book. To such a point that I don't think I can bring myself to start the next one.<br /><br />(I have downgraded my rating).<br /><br />***Original Review***<br /><br />After three books you couldn't help noticing a pretty rigid plot formula in the Harry Potter books: Harry starts out in Privet Drive, goes to Hogwarts, singlehandedly wins a vital Quidditch match, encounters either a mysterious but seemingly friendly character who turns out (a) to have an anagram for a name and (b) be in the service of Voldemort, but eventually manages to save the day, without completely squashing you-know-who.<br /><br />The good news is that while not abandoning her idiom, in The Goblet of Fire JK Rowling has allowed herself to drift loose of these moorings and evolve Harry's world: the wizarding universe is significantly different at the end of this book than it was at the beginning. You couldn't say that about the first three.<br /><br />With each book Rowling has developed her literary aspirations: the Goblet of Fire is pretty baroque compared to the roughly-hewn Philosopher's Stone. I think she manages to stay the right side of the self-indulgence line, though: it remains to be seen whether Rowling can resist the temptation to stray over it next time round.<br /><br />Rowling's instinctive gift for storytelling is generally absorbing but is by no means perfect: at the end there is some fairly ham-fisted dialogue that exists only for plot exposition. While she isn't the first writer to lean on this particular shovel (Conan-Doyle's Dr Watson character existed almost exclusively to allow Sherlock Holmes to explain parts of the plot Conan-Doyle couldn't be bothered setting out properly) this doesn't mean it isn't a flaw. Ultimately Harry Potter is a wonderful creation, and such sales are an achievement which cannot be explained away as a product of canny marketing or sheer fluke. But this early on, nor can you properly gauge how Harry stacks up against Bilbo Baggins or Aslan the Lion.

Well, I purchased the book back in the summer when it came out waiting impatiently for the Winter holiday so that I could really sit down and savor this huge tome when I had some time off to do so properly!

Unfortunately, like many commercial successes, Harry Potter 4 suffers from the dreaded &quot;more is better&quot; syndrome.  Instead of the quick, easy read that was a cornerstone of the first three books in the series, &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; dims by comparison--due mainly to its molasses-paced plot development, meandering subplots, lengthy (and dare I say, mostly irrelevant)narratives, and overdosing of magic-speak.  This book distinguishes itself from the first three with its lack of pacing.  Nearly 200 pages in and the only compelling chapter was the first.  Ironically, it was that chapter--which was featured in one of the newsweekly magazines--that originally piqued my interest in Harry Potter and inspired me to read the first three books.  Imagine the disappointment upon finally reading book four in its entirety, only to find it lacking woefully.  Gone is the charm of magic, instead replaced with a bludgeoning of hyperbole and enchantment overkill.  Then again, perhaps I am merely out of step with society because I also became bored with &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; and with most other commercial television series, after the third season.	2000-12-26

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an extraordinary book!<br />The plots are all terrific, they all have an effect of some sort on all the characters and they are very creative. And there are a lot of plots throughout the story, so that readers are not bored by reading the same old plot for the whole story.<br />The characters are also great, they are all different in many ways which is what makes them interesting. They all have different thoughts and feelings about everything. And Ms. Rowling uses unimportant characters from the other books again as main characters in this book, which is great.<br />And, of course, just about everything in this book is absolutely different than anything we know. There is magic in everything from classes to meals, and we've never heard of a Qudditch World Cup or Triwizard Tournament! The classes are all magic, from Transfiguration to Charms to Potions to Defense Against the Dark Arts. And there are wands, spells, cauldrons, and more!<br />Overall, Ms. Rowling did an excellent job with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!

I'm not going to say that this fourth Harry Potter book is the best thing I've ever read because it's not.  But J. K. Rowling is in my list of top ten authors, along with C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkein, Orson Scott Card, Terry Pratchett (why is only one of those authors American?)  and others. I am a great fan of J. K. Rowling though.  She has excellent command over her word choice.  I love to read, I get told &quot;put that book down&quot; probably mor than most kids get told &quot;turn that TV off.&quot;  I read Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in one day (hey it was summer and school was out...)I didn't mind the book being long, even if it did seem to drag at some points it turns out later that some key elements pop up in seemingly irrelevant scenes.  I love the way that Rowling gives you absolutely no clue as to who the &quot;bad guy&quot; is.  There are not many authors who would do that.  I'd just like to say a few more things. First: Rowling never said the books were for children; she wouldn't even let her own daughter read it alone. Second: To any parents who say that the book is too dark, take a look at what your child watches on TV  and then re-think judging this book. Third: To those who say that the ending could have been better.  Yes, of course it could have!  But Rowling is not trying to have this story all wraped up nice and neat, the story continues, she is leaving openings for more things later.  (That's kind of like the same thing as the people who were disappointed in Anakin Skywalker not going to the dark side in Phantom Menace, well duh! its got 2 more movies) Last: Rowling is not writing to please anyone but herself with these stories.  This is her story, she doesn't have to write anymore, she could stop writing now and live comfortably for the rest of her life.  My only problem is with Scholastic, there are discrepancies between the British and American versions that have nothing to do with language differences. All in all, I really enjoyed this book.

However most of the students, including Harry, Ron, and Hermione, are dissapointed when they hear that only wizards that are 17 years old may participate, because of the high death toll in past years. Those who wanted to enter were to put their name in the Goblet of Fire, and it would choose the most worthy contender from each school.

NOTE: This is in no way encouraging any criticism of Pullman. His books are simply wonderful.<br />I feel badly that Rowling has taken such heat for a series that continues to astound.  With each book, the world she has created comes together in a much more cohesive fashion.  Book 4 is notable not only for its innovations and adventure (it's a bold move on Rowling's part to have an entire school year with no Quidditch matches, at the same time, it makes sense and keeps us from getting tired of repetition.) Another high point is that Rowling develops her stories, and adds secondary characters from the other books to help the story move forward.  Did you think you'd seen the end of the house elves,Sirius Black, Moaning Myrtle or the Dementors? Guess again.  Rowling uses them in this book in interesting ways.  By doing this, Rowling also makes each book an essential part of the whole, and every sign is pointing us forward to book 5.<br />Another strong point of the book is the return of all of our favorite characters, and the newest developments.  Is there some kind of romantic tension between Ron and Hermione? Perish the thought, but Rowling skillfully doles out soap opera, humor, and horror and balances it very carefully.  Rowling also doesn;t spare her magic characters either.  For the past three books, we kind of were split along the &quot;magic good, muggles bad&quot; lines... this is fine,except every reader of the book (including Rowling)is a Muggle. At times, it almost became embarrassing to see non-magical characters seen as lumpish, dumb and slovenly.  In this book, we see that all the magical beings are not so perfect and pure either, most notably in a rather disturbing scene at the World Quidditch Cup matches where Muggles are hapless victims of a cruel prank. This is good as it begins to erase the rather polarized lines that Rowling had developed, and allows us to question our own black and white beliefs (i.e., not every oppressed group reacts to oppression in a noble fashion.)  Rowling also gives us the sense of political awakening in Hermione, as she sees the injustice in the situation of the house elves.  I am interested to see this situation explored more in other novels.<br />This book is, so far, the darkest of the lot.  But Harry bravely faces these challenges (including an exciting and darkly terrifying climax.) But don't let that dissuade you from reading this 4th book.  The only real complaint is that Rowling is hinting that she may wait 2 years to release the next book.  I hardly find this fair, as the first three books were released all in the span of one year.  2 years is too long of a wait, and I think a bit unfair to her loyal readers.  But, we'll see. In the meantime, I may just begin to read the series over again to kill time until the next book.  I suspect I am not the first person to do that either.ess victims of a cruel prank.

There are a few points that I want to get across.  First, no matter what I say, I loved it.  I loved all 4 books (so far) so much I helped make a Harry Potter website.  All of these other reviews explain why it's so great, and i agree.  But it is misunderstood.  J.K. Rowling never intended for the book to be for young kids... notice the age it is listed for even here on amazon.com.  It really is much more mature than it seems.  Teenagers will enjoy this book very much as well as younger children.  I made my parents read it too, and they expected it to be childish, yet they both loved it.  Yes, the plot is a little dark, but not for the older readers who i think it was intended for originally.  Rowling says that the plots of her future books will be even darker...<br />Some people say that it is against Judeo-Christian religion.  I completely disagree.  For those who say that a book focused on witchcraft promotes the worship of a devil is VERY wrong.  Why?  Because witchcraft is a religion that's been around for thousands of years - the most popular form being Wicca.  Wicca is actually a very peaceful nature religion that is in NO way associated with Satan.  And this book is just a normal magical fantasy book, and is not trying to convert you innocent little children.  Trust me.<br />The book has had a lot of hype... and it's great, but there are other books which are just as good that haven't gotten as much attention.  Be warned that while most people love it, everyone has different tastes and you might not.  It ALMOST lives up to the hype...<br />I give this book a 9/10.	2000-12-10

This book is very pivotal for the series as far as plot is concerned.  The book's intricate plot and loopholes make it hard to put down. Charming and delightful to read it seems great for all ages.  But once one gets inside the plot and predicaments that young Harry finds himself in, it may not be suitable for younger children.  Harry triumphs, but how?  By lyling, stealing, and exhibiting behavior that is literally unacceptable.  Bad aside, it shows to children the importance of friends and a strong will and determination.  Despite the good though, the bad triumphs in the main line: Evil will win back it's power and take control.  This is not what we want to expose our children to because it is not true.	2000-12-09

The stories are exciting and entertaining for parents as well as children. Strong moral messages become points for discussion, i.e. loyalty, honesty, love, belief in self. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is a darker tale, yet its more serious themes are handled in a way that does not frighten children, at least not my boys who are highly sensitive. Any concerns about the stories being anti-Christian because of magical powers used by characters is, in my opinion, greatly unfounded. If read carefully, you'll see that Christmas carols are heard during the holiday seasons, and goodness is found in characters (as well as evil in those choosing the &quot;dark side.&quot;) These stories are a joy to read and share.	2000-12-06

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire beat all!<br /> In this fourth thrilling book by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter encounters new people and strange places.  The story jumps smoothly from the Quidditch world cup to Hogwarts and then to Lord Voldemort.  Harry is almost not allowed to go to the Quidditch world cup but his best friend, Ron's' family comes and gets him from his harsh and cruel Aunt and Uncle.  When he finally gets to the Quidditch world cup he has the time of his life until the end of the tournament.  It comes about that a few death-eaters (Voldemort supporters) wanted to have a little fun, so they torture a muggle family for no reason.  Their fun is stopped by a faithful death-eater who puts the dark mark in the sky.  Harry gets out of this mess and finally makes it to Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts he finds out that the ministry of magic is going to restart the Triwizard Tournament between Hogwarts and two other wizard schools.  There are to be only three contestants that are at least sixteen years old.  But oddly a fourth contestant is chosen:  Harry Potter.  This causes corruption in the school.  Everyone thinks he cheated.  Even his best friends think he cheated.  Finally after two of the tasks he has to perform his friends believe him and the rest of the school doesn't think he put his name in.  When the third task arrives Harry and the other Hogwarts contestant Cedric Diggory find themselves tied for first.  They grab the trophy together and both are taken far away from Hogwarts where Cedric is killed and Harry comes close to being killed.  Voldemort has been waiting on them ready to kill Harry after Voldemort gets a new body.  Harry barely escapes in time to grab Cedric's body and get back to Hogwarts.  I recommend this book to People of all ages!  These Harry Potter books are fun and exciting and I am sure you will enjoy them too!	2000-12-04

I loved the twists and turns in the plots, and the secrets that were reavealed about some of the characters. Any person who likes to have a good time should read Harry Potter. You can really get into the characters and find at least one that you identify with or absolutely love, whether it be our hero, Harry Potter himself, or grumpy old Professor Snape (who happens to be my favorite character!).

K. Rowling.  This is an adventure fiction book.  The Main characters this time are Hermione, Ron, Sirius Black, Hadgrid, and of course Harry.<br />  Now at the age of 14, Harry has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his scar burn which has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather in hiding, Sirius Black.  Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars, the Death Eaters, are out for murder.  This year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests.  Harry is one of the lucky contenders. He passes the first test with the summoning charm summoning his Firebolt, the second with gillyweed. On the third test Cidoric Digory helped him but when they touched the cup at the same time together they were teleported by a portkey to the place of Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters for Lord Voldemort to regain his power.<br /> I would strongly recommend this book to anybody who likes long book, with more than 700 pages you have to be patient to get to good parts and when you begin reading the first chapter you will want to know why it is there because they mention Harry's name about one or twice at the end you see why.	2000-12-03

That she's amassed an incredibly large, almost cultish,following is another given.<br /> Picking up any 700 page book can beintimidating to almost any reader, let alone pre-pubescent ones(Rowling has a large following here!) and `Goblet' is no exception.However, intimidating and even cumbersome it may be, the novel onlypicks up steam as the pages roll by--Rowling seems to magnetize herreaders at an even more intense rate in this, the fourth, Potter book.Harry is now facing in his fourth year at Hogwarts School ofWitchcraft and Wizardry and the summer with his foster-relatives, theDursleys, has been interminable.  However, respite comes along, as theQuidditch World Cup is about to be played and Harry's friends, theWeasleys, have persuaded the Dursley's to permit Harry to attend andto stay the remainder of the summer with them.  And what a World Cupit is!  Harry, the impressionable 14-year-old is all agog over thegame, its players, and the teams' supporters.

One question I've had, that my two sons have shared, is WHY, if Harry is now a 4th year student at Hogwarts, can't he do a simple transformation spell to lose the hockey tape on his glasses? Although this specific question is not answered in the latest installment, certain aspects suggest the reasons!<br />  Harry, as anyone who has even slightly followed the saga by now knows, is one of two contestants from Hogwarts selected to serve as champion in a contest that has long been shelved due to the danger, between wizarding schools.  There are any number of twists and turns along the way, some predictable, some not. As almost everyone also knows by now, a main character dies in this volume, and my son tried to tease me by suggesting whom it might be, but like my son, I will not spoil it for those who don't yet know.  Rowling does a superb job of giving enough leads to suggest any number of characters. The whole incident, though &quot;darker&quot; as others have suggested, is nonetheless handled in a dignified fashion for the younger readers of this book.<br />  The usual crew is here, including Hagrid, Dumbledore, Snape, and Harry and pals, with some new &quot;cast members&quot; as well.

I do not believe there is anything like it.  J.K. Rowling is simply a genius.  It is one of those books that you believe you are in it.  If you have never felt it I suggest you try is some time.  When Harry rides on a broomstick to steal a dragon's golden egg.  Oh, I tell you it's like jumping out of and eight story building.  Hogwarts, school for wizardry is the school that Harry attends.  Many things that are fishy and down right wierd go on here.  Lord Voldemart, an evil wizard, rises to take control.  Sounds spooky doesn't it?  Well you're right.  Now I bet your wondering who Harry Potter is, right?  Let me tell you a little about him.  He is an unusual kid with a scar on his head in the shape of a lightning bolt.  Sounds like a freak?  Wrong!  He is a great friend to anyone who is willing to be his.  For instance, when Ron, Harry's friend, gets teased for being poor by Draco Malfoy, \\"the enemy\\".  Harry is there to back him up.  Ever been in a bind like this?  He seems like a friend that I would like to have.  My favorite part is the conflict between Voldemart and Harry.  This i what makes me the most excited.  My heart races like a pummel horse.  When Harry was entered in the Goblet of Fire.  Making him part of a wizard tournament.  Voldemart tries to kill him.  When he says,\\" And now face me like, a man... straight-backed and proud, the way your father died.\\" \\"Now we duel.\\"  That just sends a tingle down my spine.  I love it.	2000-11-30

Well, everybody knows that Harry Potter is really entertaining, well-written, imaginative, etc, so I won't bother explaining what was good about this book. It is a good read at first, it's really involving and hard to put down...<br /><br />But what is WITH the ending? It makes no sense at all, and by extension the entire book makes no sense. After the twist ending, the plot becomes an illogical mess! This completely ruined it for me. I can't like a book after realising that the entire thing revolves around such a ridiculous oversight. It frustrates and angers me far too much.<br /><br />********SPOILER WARNING!********<br /><br />[If you do not want the ending revealed, do not read the following:]<br /><br />So, what is this gigantic plot hole? Well, the entire plot of this book is based on this competition called the Triwizard Tournament that Harry is in. The conclusion of the competition is acquiring a trophy. Various mysterious forces are working to ensure that Harry is allowed into the competition and wins. When he grabs the trophy, guess what? It's a portkey that transports him to Voldemort! Wow, now we realise that this was why Harry was led into the tournament and why it was so important that he won. Sounds good? No! It's not good at all! We know from before that anything can be made into a portkey. So, why the trophy? Why not his toothbrush? Why not some random object sent to him by mail? There's no reason at all for all the time and effort gone into making him win the tournament. The entire purpose of everything in this story could have been accomplished in about one page. Harry opens package owl brings him, Harry touches whatever's inside, Harry is transported. Easy. So WHY did everything in this book even happen? Is Voldemort that dumb? Is he just a big drama queen? Does he want attention more than he wants Harry?<br /><br />********END OF SPOILER********<br /><br />So, in conclusion, this story is absolutely ridiculous. I would DIE to be able to ask Rowling what on earth she was thinking, how she could imagine this was any sort of reasonable storyline. And mainly, did she even think about the fact that it makes no sense? But how could you overlook such a thing? How can you write a plot so completely unjustified? There's not even an ATTEMPT to explain why anything mentioned above was necessary. This book completely offends my sense of logic.<br /><br />The previous Harry Potter books had fairly artificial, forced and somewhat ridiculous plot twists at the end, which seemed to be getting worse...

Harry, Ron, Hermoine and the rest of the gang are doing it again in J.K. Rowling's 4th book of the series, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire.  The writing doesn't simply lie there like in most ordinary books, it jumps out to you, and pulls you into a magic world of wizards, dragons, quidditch, and even You-Know-Who!  I actually stayed up until 3:00 on a school night just to read!  I HIGHLY RECCOMEND this book, and the the rest of this fantastic series to any age of reader, interested in fantasy or not.  I've read the series a total of about 5 times, and each time it gets better, and better.  Please take my advice and order this book immediatly!  It's most definatly worth it! :D Thanx!	2000-11-28

I had kind of heard about the Harry Potter books but never thought anything of them.  I really got interested when the fourth book came out because they had people on the news waiting at 12 at night for the stores to open.  Me and mom said we just had to get the books to see what was so great about them.  The next day we bought the 1st and 3rd and I loved the 1st.  I am 19 and have always disliked to read but I could not but these books down.  I was amazed when I read all four of them in about a month.  I think anybody of any age will love these books.

The ministry of magic has decided to start having the tri-wizard tournament again, an all of the students at hogwarts that oar 16 years old can sign up. however, Harry's name is pulled from the goblet of fire as the fourth champion. This gets all of the school mad at him because they all wanted to join but couldn't, and Cedric Diggory, the other hogwarts champion who was chosen, is a Hufflepuff, and the Hufflepuffs rarely ever get any glory. Harry's best friend, Ron gets jealous and it almost ruins their friendship.  The story is very well written. It was interesting to learn a bit more about other magical schools and meet some new Characters. J.K. Rowling left off at just the right point in the story, with one huge end to tie up...

Harry Potter's world is so vivid, so fascinating. the story is so absorbing, it's like you're there. and even though I know it isnt real, it seems very likely that i could go to London and catch the train to Hogwarts. I love these books--I read this one, over 700 pages, in less than two days. I have read every single one at least three times in English, plus I'm working on the Finnish ones now.

I'm not a kid. I didn't borrow this from a kid. And yes, I loved the book.<br />First, I am absolutely amazed at how many young people and students are reading a book of this sheer size. Harry Potter is to be celebrated if for nothing else then inspiring young people to read.<br />With that said, I have to say that adults will find this a fun book to read as well. It is incredibly well written and has plenty of action and humor coupled with transporting us back to the time when we were kids. Its interesting how the author makes many of the adult characters aloof and ecentric with the kids solving the problems and being resourceful. It's just like when we were all kids ourselves and thought we could take on the world and solve all the messes created by adults.<br />Regardless of your age, you will be transported into a magical world with a classic good versus evil battle exists with mystery, action, and drama. It's not wonder cildrenlike the book given how it taps into their imagination and creativity.<br />The author also has a fun play of words with the characters' names. Sirus sounds like &quot;serious&quot; for the character that is always serious and grave. Hermione sounds awful lot like &quot;Harmony&quot; and that's the role she plays as the maturing young lady who keeps trying to fight for the underdog and maintain the peace. Crouch is similar to Grouch which he is pretty much through the entire book. Harry himself seems to be named after &quot;Hairy&quot; because of all the hairy situations he finds himself in.<br />I know some conservative Christian groups opposed the book, but I have to say that it really is just plain fun fiction. The story taps into children's imagination the way Superman and Tom Swift did for many adults growing up. It's fun and should be read as such.<br />I found the book to be immensely fun and a great way to connect with children that I come accross every day. Most of all, it reminded me of what being a kid was like and brought back memories I have long forgotten, but am grateful that they've returned.s like and brought back memories I have long forgotten, but am grateful that they've returned.	2000-11-19

If you have enjoyed Books I - III, get ready for 700+ pages of excitement.  The end of this book is much more intense (and graphic) than the previous works.  So parents of young children may want to read it first so they know what their kids are reading.  There are surprises upon surprises in this book and even though Quidditch takes a back seat in this one, the TriWizard's Cup will more than satiate your desire for high-paced action.  Rowling also develops the characters much more in this book, especially Dumbledore, Harry, and Hagrid.  Dumbledore has always been somewhat of a mystery, but the author provides some new insights and background of this wonderful character.<br />It's definitely a must read for fans of the series and you will not be disappointed.	2000-11-17

I couldn't stand that I had to go to work--I just wanted to keep reading.  It is much darker than I would have expected.  I knew someone was going to die, and I knew that a main character couldn't be killed, but I wasn't expecting Cedric to fall out of the storyline so quickly.  I'm almost 18 years old, but I love these stories.  They're easy to read, enjoyable, and I have a few friends who think they should be banned.  I love to argue this point with them.  These stories contain some excellent lessons, and, as for the non-Christian arguements, the characters observe Christmas and Easter.  Religion is NOT being depreciated;  it may not be the focus, but it slides in with ideas of patience, trust, and goodwill.  As for the topic of &quot;witchcraft,&quot;  if children don't know the difference between fantasy and reality, they need to be taught--NOW.  Perhaps younger children should only read these books with the participation of their parents.  Parents, have some fun with this opportunity to be with your children.  Talk to them.  They can understand the concept of pretend if you introduce it to them.  I adore these books and loan them to my siblings and friends.  They can be interesting conversation-starters.  I give a high recommendation.	2000-11-11

The ingredients are mostly brilliant, though a few of the characters and crow-bar plot explanations left the mind questioning. Such is life. What do you want out of a book? Are you a child or an adult? The belief that only children grow is as much a myth as the beautiful world Rowling creates in her books. Adults and children benefit from the simple, and that is that life, in whatever world, can be approached with forgiveness and positivity. I enjoyed the creativity within the book, and I love following the events that go on. It spans every age-group, though many think it suits children. We can learn a lot from children, and Rowling invites them to develop with Harry in this book. Her role as a gentle educator is at its most potent in the fourth part, and I don't mind it being so at all.	2000-11-08

I mean I'm 18 years old and I never use to read until one day I had to read a book of 250 pgs or more, so I went to the store and my cousin said, &quot;hey Chad why don't you buy that book right there called Harry Potter,&quot; so I ended up buying it and ever since then I have never wanted to put in down. It has taken me two weeks to read the third and fourth year, which I wish it would have taken me longer so that I could have enjoyed it more. Now that Lord Voldemort is back I can't wait for the fifth year.

He triumphs over evil and wins our hearts, but this time the evil is far more sophisticated and insidious than before.  The dreaded and feared Lord Voldemort finally returns in  his hideous and revolting form, striking terror in the hearts of all the magical world and the readers as well.  This book is more sophisticated than the other three because it deals with complex moral and ethical issues as well as introduces the concept of an evil so vile that even a universal good and innocence is hard pressed to combat and conquer it.  However, the book, because of that very complexity, is more interesting and thought provoking than the others.  Perhaps aimed at a bit older reader, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, returns us to the magical world with a vengeance as once again the reader immerses himself in the characters, creatures, and circumstances of this new work. The forces of good and evil clash as before, but we see Harry and his friends facing ethical dilemmas previously unencountered as they get older and receive more advanced magical training.  The qualities of friendship, loyalty, and responsibility are strongly presented here as Harry and friends face challenge after challenge.  They are also faced with  ethical decisions that come with experience and maturity.  And the bottom line is how hard it will be to wait for the next installment to find out what happens next!	2000-10-31

So I read all three and finally got to this one. This book was great! This book starts of with a creepy chapter that I think could have been made a prologue instead of a chapter, whatever. The book then turns right back to the normal where Harry is found at the Dursley's house. He goes with Ron and Hermione to the Quiiditch World Cup where he meets VERY impotrant people. He is then shipped off to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express where he unfortunatly meets the horrible Draco Malfoy. When he gets to school there is news that Quidditch season is canceled and the Triwizard tournament will be hel. I think I'll stop here and not give away the plot.

Rowling delivers once again.  There is so much that I like about this book, I dont' know where to start.<br />First, lets start with a mini review.  As the book opens, Harry is heading off the the Quidditch World Cup. Ofcourse, when he's there, something happens, and it's lead to believe that he-who-musn't-be-named will show up soon.  As Harry gets set for his 4th year at Hogwarts, he soon learns that Quidditch will not be played this year. Instead a new contest will be held, Triwizards Tournament&quot;. This is when a couple of Wizards Schools meet (at Hogwarts this year) and one from each School is picked by the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. Harry is to young to be entered, but that last name that the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; spits out is our favorite wizard, Harry Potter.  Now who could have put in Potter's name? Was it Snape? Skeeter  Could he do that? You'll have to read to find out.<br />I liked the character of Moody. What a great character.  I also have been impressed with Herminoe.  She is my favorite character.<br />What I like is how all of the books flow into each other and how they all srring board off each other.  This book is a bit darker than the rest. What makes this darker is that fact that there is a murder. This isn't spoiling anything, Rowling made this known before the book came out.<br />What also draws me to the series that that we get to know more and more about each of the characters as the books come out.<br />I highly suggest that you read this book.  Rowling has a genius mind, and it can easily be seen.	2000-10-28

Not fit for kids below 16!  I am disappointed from Book 4. Book 1+2 were compact stories giving a certain positive view to the reader. May funny passages compensated the message of the non-ideal world in which Harry, too, lives. This is not the case with this book. Although twice as long, the passages are longwinded, without much fun, partly implausible. This book is even for adults tough. I cannot recommend this book for children, since albs are guaranteed. In contrast to the former books, Harry now escapes not because of luck AND his abilities, but only because the Bad (tm) now either wants too or makes big blunders. The last showdown with the impostor is like a cheap crime novel, in which the bad guy talks and talks till finally the police turns up at his back. I assume that Rowling overworks herself and wrecks her creativity and that her truely magnificent first books just needed time to grow. I also for the first time had the feeling that Rowling will write a long-breathed 7book-series, although she has blocked many future options for the story in book 4. After this book, I am sorry to say that I WAS a fan of Rowling. All parents, please read this book BEFORE you give it to your children (or don't buy it if that's still an alternative --))	2000-10-27

The first book was strikingly original. After this, the plot grew more interesting in Book 3, but this book doesn't do that much to advance the rather complicated plot, and Voldemort's rise is left as an ominous portent for the next books.<br />By book 4, Rowling is starting to run out of steam, I suspect. The imagination is growing a little less vivid... and the form is growing predictable. The book is still a fun romp. But its starting to pale...<br />Also Rowling does a really bad job of creating a feeling of menace with Voldemort. The beginning chapter is almost farcical- the evil badguy rubbing his hands together and scheming with his cringing sidekicks. Also by this time I've grown tired of all the standard teacher characters- the usual evil Snape, stern Mrs. McGonagall, and the wise but rather whimsical Dumbledore. One wants to see more development with the people.<br />Also, these books are not really adult's books. They are fun for them to read. But they are definitely aimed at children; they refuse or are reluctant to deal head-on with themse like betrayal, love, and death (Cedric Diggory, a main character? ha. And he's the only death).<br />Anyway if you're a Harry Potter fan you should pick this book up; but if you didn't like the series don't continue. For me, the series is beginning to fade just a little.	2000-10-25

Instead of following the hype, realize how the author's style of writing affects the book and makes it great.<br />What literary devices she uses, such as alliteration, or flashback.<br />This book is great because when I read it, I can relate to the things i'm learning in my english class.  J.K Rowling makes you feel as if you could become one of the characters, and wish you could go to Hogwarts.<br />I've heard that a lot of schools are banning Harry Potter books from school reading lists. I had to read &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; by Jack London, and found it to be very violent w/ a lot of gore.  We are allowed to read that because it is a &quot;classic&quot;, but yet we can't read Harry Potter because it talks about flying broomsticks, and funny magic spells.  I mean come on!  How ridiculous is that!  Major league sports are more violent than Quidditch.  And how are flying broomsticks offensive?<br />First of all, because of the hype, people think that kids ages  3-8 can read or be read to.  Maybe it works for some kids but half the stuff I really do not think they would understand.  Its a young adult book, more along the lines of 9-up.<br />Thank you for reading what I have to say.	2000-10-24

I don't like the reviews that call these 'the kid's books for adults'.  They may have been true for the third book, but the first two were no more 'for adults' that 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is.  They were definately children's books.  They were particularly good children's books, and like most children's books, enjoyable for adults to read.<br /> This fourth book is most definately not a children's book.  A better way to describe it would be 'an adult's book that children will enjoy'.<br /> This book is possibly one of the best I've ever read.  Rowling, I'm convinced, is either an incredibly brilliant writer or more than one person.  The characters she has established in the previous books really blossom in this book.  Snape, in particular, I look forward to seeing in future installments.<br /> What really made this book great was how real the emotions are among the characters.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I was almost in tears when Hagrid said to Harry 'Yeh did as much as yer father would've done, an' I can' give yeh no higher praise than that.'<br /> Read this book.

It's natural, because the later versions are built upon the original foundation. A version up, certainly, but never a complete change that awes the readers. First, goblet of fire doesn't play much role in the book, not a likely candidate for becoming the title of the book. Second, much of the ideas of Rowling's are now becoming repetitive, and new ones are certainly not the magnitude of the previous volumes.<br />Third, the format of the book has become so familiar that you can almost feel what's going to appear next. Fourth, a great detective-like story should give readers chance and a rational guidance to solving the clue. Rowling never gives readers such opportunities. The result of the book might be surprising, but lacks the rational flow as to why Triwizard Tournament was necessary, why goblet of fire is such an object of fuss, why Cedric should die, and why Voldemort should go through such ordeal to relive again. But most important of all is with Harry himself. An ordinary boy as he is, he is nevertheless never given any special power or special skill that will necessitate him to become a powerful wizard in many sequels to come. And even if he were given such power afterward, it would certainly look awkward. In a word, Harry is becoming rather boring.	2000-10-19

A great book for parents and children to enjoy TOGETHER!	2000-10-19

A darker turn, adding shades to everything we thought we already knew about Harry's world, but neither too dark nor too convoluted. In my view, it remained refreshingly innocent for a story about young teenagers.<br />I'll admit that I thought the first hundred or two hundred pages of the book were slow...but watch out world! Ms. Rowlings strikes again with new characters that become as fascinating and as hysterical, as the old ones.<br />Bartie Crouch, the Ministry wizard with a fatal soft spot nobody would have suspected.<br />Bertha Jorkins, a missing Ministry witch with a passion for gossip that could be the key to Voldemort's return.<br />Mad-Eye Moody, the battered new DADA instructor who isn't afraid to bend the rules... and knows all too much about the Dark powers that want Harry dead.<br />Cedric Diggory, the Headboy with a talent for beating Harry to what he wants most.<br />Rita Skeeter, the journalist with a flare for the worst kind of tabloid journalism and ways of getting her scoop on Harry.<br />The old characters, too, take on new interest as Voldemort's past Reign of Terror begins more and more to affect Harry's present and polarize loyalties. Why does hapless Neville Longbottom know so much about curses? What is the deeper, darker secret Hagrid has been hiding all this time? Is there a sinister past behind the intense scrutiny Moody is giving Professor Snape? What are Fred and George Weasley up to now, and why does it involve blackmail? Who were Voldemort's Death Eaters, and why did they make an appearance at the Quidditch World Cup? And who is trying to force them out of hiding after so many years?<br />Yes, Harry has his plate very full his fourth year at Hogwarts. As if it isn't enough that an all-too-realistic dream of a much stronger Lord Voldemort has Harry writing his godfather Sirius for advice, Harry is illegally and unwittingly entered as a contestant in the TriWizard Tournament-an international competition between rival schools that has an perilously high rate of past fatalities. Even the benevolent Hogwarts Headmaster, professor Dumbledore, may not be able to protect Harry this time, for an inside enemy has tricked the Goblet of Fire into selecting Harry as a fourth TriWizard champion. But Voldemort and his henchmen are plotting more than merely Harry's death...<br />The emotional entanglements of the year add new-and pleasantly surprising-layers of complexity to Harry's perspective. Harry's friendship with Ron is strained by jealousy. Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to discover the dating scene and the joys and pitfalls of dealing with the opposite sex. (The bickering between Ron and Hermione is delicious and certainly convinces me that there's more than a little mutual interest there.) Harry, Hermione, and others (in a telling twist) are pestered by a reporter who ruins more reputations before lunchtime than most people tarnish in years. Harry begins to learn the importance of second chances and trust as his path, and that of everyone around him, becomes more and more enmeshed in the web of stories behind the people around him. Most of all, past and present collide as Voldemort is reborn and the deaths and terror begin again... And Harry will never be the same.ard Tournament-an international competition between rival schools that has an perilously high rate of past fatalities.

It is a fantastic story that allows us to mix the magical world of Harry Potter and his friends with the common everyday world around us.<br />I would like to say Thank You to J. K.

I been in a major dispute with various people over this topic, that somepeople believe that Harry Potter should not be all good and Voldermort not be all evil.  I do not believe that Harry Potter is all good and Voldermort is all evil.  I also believe that J.K. Rowling is a good author.  Harry Potter has some characteristics of an evil character, Voldermort. He can speak the language of snakes, which was a major characteristic of Voldermort and founder of the Slytherins.  That doesn't seem good to me.  Voldermort does demonstrate a few nice points when he is in forms of others. Even though his intentions are bad, he can do considerate things.  I highly recommend this book to everyone, because I know you will enjoy it.	2000-10-17

As you know, Harry Potter, a 14 year old wizard, has always had his work cut out for him. This is Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts, a school for sorcery, and is mad because his favorite sport, quidditch, has been cancelled. Instead, a triwizard contest that was closed because of the death toll has been reopened. The age limit has been set for 17 but Harry's name somehow gets entered and now he has to play.  Now Harry has to try and survive the series of events that are placed before him. Soon Harry starts to get the feeling that some one is out to hurt him,or, to kill him. Now, with the help of his friends, Ron and Herimone, he will try and win the competiton. If you enjoyed the other books by J.K.Rowling, this book is sure to bring out the wizard inside of you as you follow Harry through his fourth year at Hogwarts.	2000-10-16

I really don't consider this book in the same league as the first three in the series. The sheer size of the book allows Joanne Rowling to include much more detail, therefore weaving a more intricate and fascinating story. New characters are born and old favourites (including Dobby, the house elf) revisited. The ending of the book is a lot darker than in any of the other three books and we see what Voldemort is really like and learn the identity of some of the Death Eaters.   Despite a predictable mysterious villain (this time its Proffessor Moody) and a rather slow start, I love this book. And Harry's hormones finally start to kick in. Brilliant.	2000-10-15

The Harry Potter series are great books for anyone to read.  All ages would love him.  Little kids adore him and elders live out their inner child in him.  In this book Harry will take you on an adventure thrill ride.  He will take you zooming through the air on his new \\"Firebolt\\" as he narrowly escapes the Hungarian Horntail and to the depths of the Hogworts lake trying to rescue his best friend Ron while escaping grindlows and merpeople.  This is an excellent example of the age-old archetype of good vs. evil.  In actual life we can never defeat evil because evil will always exist in the human heart.  But we can put it in a story and make a monster represent evil and a hero can defeat the evil and we can apply that to our life that there is hope.  This is a great book and everyone should read it.  If they don't they are denying themselves a wonderful, magical experience.	2000-10-11

After having heard about the Harry Potter books and seen them in the bookstores, I still had not read any of the series because I considered them children's books.

The woman who wrote the review was an adult and she raved about the book so much I had to satisfy my growing curiosity by buying the book.  I haven't looked back...I've read them all and now, after finishing book 4, am in a state of Harry Potter withdrawal.  This series of books is the best I have read since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.<br />Goblet of Fire develops more fully some of the main characters in the series, Fred and George Weasley, Hermione Granger and Professor Dumbledore.  The reader is brought along as Harry is growing up and J.K. Rowling keeps the reader involved and engrossed.<br />There are no Quidditch games this season at Hogwarts but the International Quidditch Cup makes up for the lack.  Instead, Hogwarts is hosting the Triwizard Tournament an event that challenges champions from three schools in various feats of bravery and wizardry.<br />There are twists, turns and a number of surprises in the Goblet of Fire as in all the books in this series, and the end of the book is not only a surprise but sets the tone for the next book.  It can't be emphasized enough that this series of books is positively fantastic for children and adults.  Buy them all, read them all in order, you won't be sorry.	2000-10-10

The Harry Potter series is a perfect example of fine literature that can be enjoyed by all ages.<br />With each book, Harry and his companions age one year. As they get older, their perspectives gain in maturity. The writing becomes more mature in keeping with the characters' development. Book 4, in my opinion, is already at or above the reading level of some adults. My husband and I have worked to cultivate rich vocabularies,  and we had to look up a couple of words in the dictionary.<br />The books also take on more and more complex themes: Like the non-magic world, the wizarding community has its prejudice -- expressed not in terms of skin pigmentation but of magical parentage (Witches and  wizards who come from Muggle families are termed &quot;Mudbloods&quot; by pure-blooded magic users). What better way to introduce children to the concept of prejudice, and in a way that makes abundantly clear that it is  wrong and inexcusable?<br />Some of the moral issues explored by Harry and his peers are still being wrestled with by adults. From Book 3, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; one such moral dilemma comes to mind  -- When are extreme punishments appropriate, and for what crimes?<br />Something is noticeably different in No. 4 in comparison with the three previous books -- for some reason, the American publishers decided to leave all the British slang intact. Generally, I was able to deduce the meaning through context, but if you find this difficult, a query on &quot;British English&quot; turned up several dictionaries of British slang available through Amazon.com.<br />&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; marks a midway point in the entire series, planned to be seven volumes altogether. The book also introduces themes that will carry over in a successive volume or volumes. J.K.

I enjoyed the World Cup, but wish it would have been a bigger presence in the book being that it won't occur again until Harry's out of Hogwarts.

Gleick (&quot;New York Times,&quot; July 10, 2000)<br />  BERKELEY, Calif. -- My family, like so many others, was excited about Saturday's release of yet another  Harry Potter book. But although there are many legitimate reasons for praising the series -- the exciting  plots, the new young readers being drawn to books, the quality of the writing -- I am disappointed about  one thing: the decision by Scholastic, publisher of the American edition, to translate the books from  &quot;English&quot; into &quot;American.&quot; Scholastic even went so far as to change the title of the first Harry Potter book  from &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot; to &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; Why? Were  the editors worried that some people wouldn't buy the book because they couldn't understand it in its  original language? Were they concerned that some children would be confused by new words for  otherwise familiar objects or actions?  I like to think that our society would not collapse if our children started calling their mothers Mum instead  of Mom. And I would hate to think that today's children would be frightened away from an otherwise  thrilling book by reading that the hero is wearing a jumper instead of a sweater.  Are we afraid that when presented with new vocabulary, children will shrink away? Or that alternative  spellings of previously known words will make children (and adults) suddenly start spelling things wrong,  sending school test scores falling?  A careful reading of both the English and the American editions of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's  Stone&quot; reveals three kinds of substitutions. The first are spelling differences: gray for grey, color for  colour, flavor for flavour, pajamas for pyjamas, recognize for recognise and the like.  The second are differences in common words or phrases: pitch turns to field, sellotaped to taped,  fortnight to two weeks, post to mail, boot of car to trunk of car, lorry to truck.  The third are metamorphoses of truly English experiences or objects into something different, but  distinctly American: crumpets to English muffins, for example (a particular odious change, in my opinion).<br />  My two sons didn't have any difficulty understanding the British version of the book sent to them by their  aunt in London.  I admit to occasionally offering the meaning of a new word the first time it appeared, but don't we do that  with every book we read to our children, or help them read to themselves?  Do we really want children to think that crumpets are the same as English muffins? Frankly, reading about  Harry and Hermione eating crumpets during tea is far more interesting to an American than reading about  them eating English muffins during a meal.  Are any books immune from this kind of devolution from English to &quot;American&quot; English? Would we sit  back and let publishers rewrite Charles Dickens or Shakespeare? I can see it now: &quot;A Christmas Song,&quot;  &quot;A Story of Two Cities,&quot; &quot;The Salesman of Venice.&quot;  By protecting our children from an occasional misunderstanding or trip to the dictionary, we are  pretending that other cultures are, or should be, the same as ours.

What about &quot;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe?&quot;  They have loads of magic and mystery, but no one seems to call them &quot;sacreligious.&quot;  I think people are just looking for something to complain about.  What about how these books &quot;try to push children to join the occult?&quot;  No more than &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; tells us to take up slavery, or &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; tells us to let our evils out and kill each other.  The Harry Potter books are just books that try to strike up the imagination in children that lies dormant, due to the fact that television seems to take up a lot of a child's time.  If people would think about it, these books have gotten a lot of children into reading, which is a good thing.  If you have a problem with such activities, then don't read the books.  It's as simple as that.  Or, you can read these wonderful books and let J.K. Rowling share her tales of adventure with you.	2000-10-08

There is neither God nor Easter in these books, though there is Christmas, and the wizards appear to have an insatiable appetite for food, sweets, nectar, chess and sport(?). There is no sex to speak of, other than the blushing engagements of wizards of every age. There is no self-knowledge, nor is there inquiry into purpose. However, I have read these books with real enjoyment, chapter by chapter, to my children who are aged six, eight and ten, and we look forward to the next installment. The plots are fast-paced, the people interesting, though stereotypical, and the events are riveting. But in the context of redemption, the thematic content is not threatening to our morals, ambitions, or self-image. These books are not an exploration of good and evil. Harry is a cardboard character, and we like him because even though he is meek, we know that he will inherit the earth, just as we ourselves hope to. Who then is Voldemort?  Is he evil? He kills and tortures for pleasure, and even more appallingly, he tortures for pleasure, and then kills for boredom. But this Voldemort  knows a greater, more visceral fear than anyone else in the chronicles (see the \\"Goblet of Fire\\"), and apparently, what this is \\"All About\\", is that Voldemort wants only one thing, immortality, he is afraid to die, and in his quest for immortality, he must create a hell on earth for all otherwise living creatures. Only Albus Dumbledore , the brilliant and enigmatic Headmaster of Hogwarts School, is significantly in his way, as is Harry Potter, who may pass for Everyman of courage, justice, and peace. The rest of the planet lives in fear of Voldemort as \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\". Having taken us this far, having engaged the entire world, I pray now that Ms. Rowling will inform us of who we are and of our place in the scheme of things. There may be much to be learned from these books and, as a sequel, may I suggest the Old Testament Prophecy of Daniel?	2000-10-07

While not as achingly beautiful and heartbreaking as the Lord of the Rings, this series definitely has earned it's place in great novels of fantasy.  J K Rowling has created a great world for her characters to exist in.  There is a lot of humour in these books. I am totally entranced of the whole idea of Hogwarts, a school for young wizards.

This is the fourth book in the phenomenally successful Harry Potter series about a schoolboy wizard. I and many other fans eagerly waited for it, and I am pleased to say that it does not succumb to the law of worsening sequels (as is so often the case with popular franchises) and it is as good, if not better than, the first three books.<br />This fourth story has a darker, more complex tone than before. Harry Potter is now fourteen years old and in his fourth year at Hogwarts School, with his friends Ron and Hermione. He is growing up and maturing - gone is the wide-eyed, annoyingly precocious youngster from the first novel and film in the series. In this fourth book we meet a sullen, often angry teenager who is frightened and confused (especially about girls) and haunted by nightmarish visions of death.<br />Lots of dangerous battles are fought (described in pretty violent detail) and as mentioned, he starts to take notice of the opposite sex (one girl in particular, called Cho Chang - catches his eye). For reasons I won`t go into here, this plot point struck a chord with me, as it contained some parallels with an all too brief friendship I had shared with a girl at college......<br />Plot points such as these make his character more realistic, and show us Harry is not just a `wizard`. He is also a regular teenager with human problems that everyone faces, relating to life, love and growing up, something the readers (depending how old they are) can relate to (I certainly can).<br />Lots of people say Harry Potter is just a kids` book, but I disagree. Like the best Disney cartoons and animated features, the book works on a number of levels - as well as being an exciting adventure, there are some references and funny jokes that will amuse older people. For instance, one character is called Rita Skeeter, who is a reporter for the Daily Prophet newspaper. She will do anything to get a good story, even if that bending the facts, exaggerating and lying. This allows Rowling to take humorous pot shots at the British media and newspaper journalists of the gutter press, a joke which adults and older children will understand but may well be missed by youngsters.<br />There are also some parts that could scare young children (for example, the rather grisly detail in which the fights are described).<br />I think the story is really exciting and the complex, unpredictable plot will keep you wondering what will happen next. It`s much longer than the last book (the British release has over 600 pages!) but the story is so good that once you start it, its really hard to put down.<br />That said, the book`s length does turn out to be an issue sometimes. Though I would be the first to criticize the early novels (Philosophers/Sorcerers Stone in particular) for perhaps being too light and kiddy, Harry Potter`s early appeal was combining fantasy elements with a classic school story, in one tightly plotted package. On the whole, Goblet of Fire is excellent but it does have a tendency to meander as we move away from that simple template.<br />I found all the nonsense about the Quidditch World Cup (a reference to the 1998 Football World Cup in France perhaps?) un-necessary after a while for example, which could have been cut out or at least shortened - and we would still have been left with a fine piece of work, without disrupting the flow of the story, in my opinion.<br />On the other hand, one must admire the author for trying to bring more depth to her characters and flesh out their personas, which draws the reader into Harry`s world, making it seem believable.<br />Overall, I think this is a truly `magical` story.g to take humorous pot shots at the British media and newspaper journalists of the gutter press, a joke which adults and older children will understand but may well be missed by youngsters.<br />There are also some parts that could scare young children (for example, the rather grisly detail in which the fights are described).<br />I think the story is really exciting and the complex, unpredictable plot will keep you wondering what will happen next.

They got to understnad that in Harry Potter can only brighten their day as well as their lives.  Right now all i'm waithing for is the 5th book that is out next year.

She doesn't pull her punches and has done a great job with creating rounded characters, warts and all. She could've trimmed some of the middle parts without taking away from the plot (though the entire story was uniformly entertaining), especially for the younger readers.  On the other hand, I'm  sure that many readers (myself included) enjoy 700+ pages of Harry Potter.	2000-10-04

It is still very well written and very exciting. This episode of the Harry Potter saga is much longer than the previous tales (743 pages), so we get experience a much more detailed idea of what it is like to live as a wizard or a witch. Harry even spends the first several chapters at the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasleys, so not all of the book (or the plot) revolves around life at Hogwarts.<br />The characters are growing up, and as such are getting much more mature. While the development of the characters leads us into the typical realm of adolescence (ie: boys &amp; girls, dances, etc.), it also marks a point where we realize our fictional friends are stronger, so expect a more powerful battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil. Expect &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; to be much darker then your previous journeys into Harry's world. Don't expect to find only magic flavored jellybeans and practical jokes, also expect fear, mutilation, and death. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; has a much more realistic and heart felt ending than what you will be expecting, just keep in mind that this is all pivotal to the overall plot of the seven book series.<br />In case I have you completely down about the dark side of the new book, I might as well mention that we do get to see Sirius and the loveable little Dobby, as well as some of Dobby's new elf friends.	2000-10-04

Since then we have lent it out to numerous friends and relatives who were equally in love with it.<br />It has all the classic elements - good against evil, bullies, unfair situations, misunderstandings, the magic that can help you win even when all seems lost.

Should Quaker kids be reading Harry Potter stories?  As you no doubt know, Harry is a wizard in a world of dragons, warlocks, magic spells and battles.<br />  Reasons why Quaker kids should read Harry Potter:<br />* The Harry Potter books are wonderful for getting kids interested in READING.<br />* Most Quaker adults are Muggles, and the books teach kids how to deal with Muggles<br />* There are too few books out that interest boys in reading - the Potter books get boys AND girls interested in reading.<br />* There are too few books out that parents enjoy reading with their kids.<br />* Harry probably has Quaker routes - he's interested in social causes, the rights of the underdog, and general fairness to all.  He even leans toward non-violent solutions to most problems. This book especially touches on the social causes, as Hermione fights for the rights of the House Elves.<br />I have to confess, I found the beginning of this book simultaneously boring (too much Quidditch), and questionable as there was some brutality.  I was also saddened toward the end of this book at a death that could have been better handled.<br />But in the big picture, the sports theme is of interest to boys (girls, too), we can read and talk together, and my son's reading interest has gone up 100% since going through all 4 of these books.<br />The only downsize here is that we don't know what to read until  the fifth book comes out!	2000-10-03

Rowling gets caught up in the details and there isn't enough interesting aspects to the story to sustain all the words, a sort of Stephen King disease.  Her literary style becomes too apparent and a drain.  This book desperately needs an editing pass and a return to the wittiness and drama of her previous books.  I read the previous Harry Potters to my 7 year old (now 8) and he'd beg for another chapter, and I would read ahead after he fell asleep.  This book puts him to sleep after a couple of pages, and I am happy just to put it down to the night.

The Harry Potter Series is an excellently written set of books.  They<br />are very imaginative and are an amazing story from problem to<br />resolution.  This is the first set of books that have an ending that<br />is actually many times more exciting than you would think.  Also, they<br />are completely unpredictable.<br />Now, there are some parents who<br />absolutely forbid there children to read them.  Some say that they<br />attempt to promote witchcraft and Satanism.  These books are filled to<br />the cover of magic and magical teachings.  Harry and his friends learn<br />about the history of the magical world, the art of potion-making, the<br />transfiguration (changing one thing into another) and apparition<br />(disappearing from one place and reappearing in another) processes,<br />the magically botanical studies of Herbology, the care of magical<br />creatures, Charms (spells that allow you to move objects, protect<br />yourself, as well as change the physical appearance of things),<br />Divination (a.k.a. predicting the future; Harry and his friends do not<br />in anyway excel in this subject and believe that very few wizards<br />carry this talent), Astronomy, and last and most important, Defense<br />Against the Dark Arts.<br />It is fun and exciting to read about all of<br />his classes, but let's think for a minute about one in particular,<br />Defense Against the Dark Arts.  People go on and on about the evil<br />Dark Lord in the books and about the dark spells and curses that are<br />feared by Harry and his friends and teachers.  But if Harry takes a<br />specific class to learn how to defend himself against these evil<br />topics, how can anyone say that these books promote evil witchcraft<br />and wizardry.  All of the magical people in the books are fearful of<br />the Dark Side and are fighting against it. Against it?  Hmm...Does<br />that really sound as though these books were written to promote the<br />Dark Side?  Absolutely not!<br />These books were written and are<br />intended to be read for the entertainment of the reader by enjoying<br />Harry's many adventures at his magical school.  How can learning about<br />history of magic, potion-making, transfiguration, divination, charms,<br />astronomy, the caring for/of magical plants and animals, and Defense<br />Against the Dark Arts (there's that word again) be sac-religious,<br />satanic, or even promotional to violence and slander.  If you ask me,<br />most of these parents haven't even read these books to know enough<br />about them, and even if they have, they probably have so much free<br />time that all they care about is having something gripe or complain<br />about to consume time.<br />Also, I understand that some parents are<br />speaking out against the Harry Potter Series because of what they have<br />heard about it, and are trying to protect their children from a<br />Christian point of view.  Well as a life-long Christian that grew up<br />around the church, I would just like to say that I have no objections<br />about reading the Harry Potter Series.  As I have said before, the<br />characters in these books battle against the evil Dark Side.  Now<br />there are those students who believe in the magic in these books.<br />Those students are the types that more than likely have no Christian<br />background.  I have also heard that there are some kids who were<br />Christians but now say that magic is the only way and that the Bible<br />is nothing but a terribly ruly book of stories and rules.  These<br />students have already got problems if they actually believe in this<br />magic.  J.K. Rowling states in an interview that she has written her<br />books for the enjoyment of the reader.  Rowling herself does not<br />believe in any of this.  She simply wrote some stories for her own and<br />even what she thought would be the few people that would read them's<br />entertainment.  Never did she guess that her writings would be<br />published, much less become bestsellers.<br />In this Interview,<br />Rowling also states that her favorite author is C. S. Lewis.<br />C.S. Lewis is a born-again Christian with many biblical teachings.<br />Yet he wrote the Chronicles of Narnia.  I don't know how many times<br />I've read articles explaining how different the Harry Potter Series is<br />from the Chronicles, but still, how can an evil witch with deep dark<br />magic be so much different than the evil Dark Lord in the Harry Potter<br />Series.  My own church family heard our preacher, Rev. Jeff Witcher,<br />32, preach quote after quote from C. S. Lewis's teachings.  Lewis<br />writes about the fight against the evil deep dark magical witch in<br />Narnia, and Rowling writes about Harry's fight against the Dark Lord<br />in the wizard world, yet C.S. Lewis is still looked up to for his<br />biblical teachings so why is there so much fuss about Harry Potter?<br />Both series are in the school libraries around the world and are even<br />used as English reading tools during class, and both have literature<br />and teaching materials used for teaching other forms of language arts.<br />Both series' have a moral for each chapter.  Both series' contain<br />books that have won awards such as the Parenting Book of the Year<br />Award.  So, I ask again, what is wrong with Harry Potter?<br />So for<br />those students that are turning away from Christianity and are<br />converting to these beliefs, try to understand that J.K. Rowling did<br />not write these books to try to encourage Christians to believe in<br />magic.  No human can magically do anything so why would anyone believe<br />in magic to be real.  The purpose in these books were to entertain the<br />reader.<br />A writer from Beliefnet ([...]) says this:<br />&quot;There are some Christians who view these two activities as a<br />contradiction--who think that Hogwarts is worse than hogwash, and that<br />the magical scenarios of J.K. Rowling's imagination are inherently<br />un-Christian. I would counter that, instead, these books have the<br />potential to be profoundly Christian if readers can see past the<br />medium (magic) to the novels' deeper messages about self-sacrifice,<br />the triumph of good over evil, and the glorious possibility of human<br />redemption.&quot;<br />Just two weeks ago, at my school, the special<br />education teacher was telling the school secretary while I was working<br />in the front office as an eighth grade office-aid that one of her<br />students that she had been having problems with trying to keep him<br />calm, quiet and attentive had found the first book in the series and<br />was silently trying to interpret the words on his own.  She thought<br />that if this book appeared to be that interesting to him, maybe she<br />should read it to him and use his interest in this particular book as<br />a tool to assist her in teaching him how to read and learn better and<br />easier.  So if even students that are in some way disabled can read,<br />understand, and enjoy these books, why can't everybody try or at least<br />have the chance to read, enjoy, and understand them.  For as I have<br />stated before, those that come to believe that magic is real and are<br />taken to the Dark Side because of these books, are in less<br />understanding before they have read them than after because everyone<br />should know that none of these things that we read and enjoy reading<br />about are true.<br />Now let's focus on another of Harry's subjects,<br />Divination.  Many believe that the act of trying to predict the future<br />in the Harry Potter Series should not even be written.  But once<br />again, Harry does not in any way excel in this subject and believes as<br />Hermione said 'that it is a very imprecise branch of magic'.  In fact,<br />during Harry's third year at Howarts, Hermione disagreed with their<br />Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, and quit taking theclass.<br />Now that is saying something because Hermione is the most clever of<br />the three main characters, Harry, Ron Weasley, and herself.  She also<br />stated at the beginning of the year that 'if foolish guesswork and<br />pretending to see death omens is what it takes to become a true<br />see-er, then I'm not sure I will be taking this class much longer.<br />Just because Rowling writes about Divination, doesn't mean that she<br />believes in it nor is she trying to encourage her young readers to<br />take on this foolish practice.  So if Harry and his friends believe<br />that Professor Trelawney is as they say continuosly an &quot;old<br />fraud&quot;, Hermione quit taking the class, and Ron is always<br />performing stupid imitations of her, then how can anyone say that<br />Rowling is trying to promote this strange practice, and like I said<br />before, anyone who actually believes in this practice or any other<br />form of magic, is already as Ron believes, the headmaster, Professor<br />Dumbledore is, 'off his rocker'.<br />WoW!  Can you believe it!  That<br />brings up another topic, Professor Dumbledore.  I've heard other<br />complaints about some of Dumbledore's wise sayings.  One, for example,<br />is when in the third book, after Harry tells Dumbledore that he<br />thought he saw his father, but it was really him, Dumbledore answers<br />by saying that, although he may not have actually seen his father, he<br />may have simply found him inside himself.  Many argue in reply to this<br />wise saying, that your parent's or any other ancestor's spirits do not<br />remain inside you after they are deceased.  I agree on this thought.<br />No, the dead's spirits do not remain inside us (only Jesus's does<br />that, whenever we ask him to), but the memories that we have of them,<br />however, do.'s imagination are inherently<br />un-Christian.

The book starts eerie and tense, showing Voldemort from the muggle's point of view.  Voldemort makes very evil plans.  The story then moves on to the International Quidditch World Cup, which includes funny moments with the Weasleys.  Then the mystery begins when Voldemort's supporters and powers are on the loose.  At Hogwarts, there is the Triwizard Tournament, which involves an important character first introduced in Book 3.  There is excitement in each of the tasks.  The storyline and plot of the book is incredibly mysterious  and gripping.  All of the books are full of great mystery, but this is the greatest mystery of all.  What is the deal with Mr. Crouch?  Who got Harry into this mess?  Who's the bad guy?  The answers in the end of the book will surprise you.<br />The whole nature and portrayal of the book is what helps it become great literature.  This book prooves that all of the censorship against the books are not true.  The book never teaches black magic, but teaches AIGNST THE DARK ARTS.  The evil dark lord Voldemort, who murdered the parents of our hero, has destroyed the lives and families of many.  All lot of history on Voldemort is given in this book.  He and his servents casted curses that caused pain and death, harming very good people.  In the end, the evil dark lord destroys a very good person who you will love, and other good people.  The overall meesage is much similar to the message in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.  The tragic ending brings tears to the eyes, but helps teach the overall message of seeing what the evil easy way does to what is good.<br />While the book contains serious parts, there are many fun, exciting, and entertaining moments.  Harry fights against dragons, merpeople, and monsters(along with his worst enemy).  Hermione battles against servitude, which in a way gives a satiracal portrayal of activism.  Rita Skeeter damages reputations, which gives a satiracal portroyal of the news media(I love the way Hermione gets back at Skeeter!).  Fred and George make their plots, which gives another important message in the end: DON'T GAMBLE BEFORE YOU ARE 21 YEARS OLD!

Believe me, if you have never been excited for the next Harry Potter book, this book will make you really really really excited for the fifth book.<br />The only complaint that I have is that the title didn't fit the book that well.  The Goblet of Fire made it's big appearance in chapter 16, but from then on it was only metioned.  Parents should not be worried about their kids reading this book.

I haven't come across anyone who doesn't enjoy these books. She follows the Joe-Bob Briggs rule of sequels, which is that the closer a sequel is to the original, the better it will be. The formula is still the same, but the mix gets richer and richer with time. Plus there is now a real story developing through the books, as well as Harry's development. It really is staggering how, given that there are so many books, one book can stand out so far - Ms Rowling really has a magic gift.	2000-09-29

I am 28 years old and I am a big fan of Harry Potter. One thing I find intesesting about Harry Potter is how often he  is physically wounded in these books.  And yet he is so courageous!  Of course this is a fantasy novel most 14 year olds would be running to their mommies.  I'm glad that Harry Potter can be a hero to the younger readers.  I think the message at the end of the book is clear- Meet your problems head on!  I really like that.  I like how the books are getting more mature.<br />Dumbledore has also been one of my favorite characters-I really enjoyed the insight into his life.  These books are always suprising and very imaginative.  I must say that I am glad we have to wait for the next one.  It will give the kids a good chance to read something else.  Judging by the ending of the fourth book, the next book will be very exciting!  What will the wizarding world do now that Voldemort has his body back?  The good will prevail!	2000-09-27

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire brings out all of the issues of adolescence in a charming and humorous manner.  J.K. Rowling's setting is also changing.  The innocence of childhood is encroached by fear and anxiety.  The Hogwart world darkens as evil makes a comeback.  All of these evolutions are superbly orchestrated by the author in a manner that is satisfying and screaming for Book V.  Harry is growing and this series is growing as a classic.	2000-09-27

The Harry Potter stories have taken the world by storm.  There are four of them now.  Written for pre- and early teen readers, Harry's adventures still have appeal for older readers, with the same magic the classic children's tales such as Wind in the Willows, Peter Pan, and the Pooh stories.  Harry was introduced in &quot;Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; along with his cohorts, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and the rest of the faculty, staff, and students of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizzardry.  Harry is an orphan, living with his aunt, uncle, and cousin in an environment that makes Cinderella's look good.  Harry's mother and  father were both magicians.  A bad magician, Voldemort, one on the &quot;dark side,&quot; killed Harry's parents.  Sent to live with his aunt and uncle (and brat of a cousin), Harry doesn't know about the magic world.  However, Harry is a hero in the magic world; and when he reaches eleven, he is admitted to the Hogwarts School.  Thus begin the adventures.  Each of the four books thus far covers one school year.  The plan must be for at least seven books, because Hogwarts has a seven year curriculum.  Each year so far Harry and his friends have foiled an evil scheme to bring back the bad magician. Each year the schemes have become more complex, and the story told better.  The books have also gotten longer.  After the fourth book, in spite of Harry's heroism, the evil one, Voldemort, has returned and is ready to begin again to conquer first the magic world, and then the mundane &quot;Muggle&quot; world.  There have been some complaints about the books, because they have witches and magic.  But as a character in another story said, &quot;Magic, alchemy, science-what's the difference?&quot;  There are forces fighting for good against forces fighting for evil.  Isn't that what Milton and Dante, and even Jeremiah, wrote about?  In the Harry Potter stories, there is no confusion about who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  So the good guys play hockey riding on broomsticks, so what?  It is fun and it is entertaining.  I am certainly looking forward to Harry's next adventure.od guys play hockey riding on broomsticks, so what?  It is fun and it is entertaining.

As the freshness had worn of just a little bit in part three (see my review there) I wondered what counter-measures Mrs. Rowling would use to cope with this. Well, she must have noticed the same thing and this book is a little departure from the other three novels. First, it is nearly twice as long as the last one (well, great, the more Harry, the better) and some of the now familiar plot elements of the first three have to take a back-seat in this novel like the Quidditch school-match (for which you get a world-cup!) and mostly, the ordinary school life and lessons. The unsual length of this book makes it a bit slow until Harry gets to Hogwarts again (don't worry, after that, the book picks up its usual Rowling-breakneck-pace) but it allows the author to include some nice plot-side-lines (if you ever wanted to know something about &quot;magic-tabloid-journalism&quot; or a house-elf liberation front, try this one!) which are not exactly necessary for the main plot but add greatly to the canvas of this novel and the enjoyment of the reader. What I mostly enjoyed about this book was that the endless imagination of Mrs. Rowling has not dried up and she was still able to come up with a surprising amount of new ideas, new facets in each of the characters, a suspenseful and quite complex plot and, for the fourth time, with a slam-bang finale. Now a note to concerned parents: If you have read that in this book Harry starts noticing girls and that it is darker than the last ones, don't worry, you can still let your children read it: Yes, Harry starts noticing girls, but only from a distance, nothing more (I wonder in which book Mrs. Rowling will come up with a girl-friend for Harry; if you have read this book, you know that there are two contenders) and this book is definitely darker than the other books but shoulnd't be too frightening for smaller children. If they're used to fairy-tales and over 10 years old, they will be able to cope with this, trust me on that. The only complaint I have is that the author put so many loose ends in this book that her struggle to tie them all in the end is too clearly visible, the last pages are crammed with solving mysteries and explaining things. The construction of the first three novels was a little bit more elegant. But let this not hinder you, this is still a very satisfying, entertaining and inspiring novel and simply a great read which is still very well worth another five stars. Now I have, like so many people out there, suffer the terrible ordeal to wait a long time for the fifth book and you bet I will be standing in line when the bookstores open around midnight on some fine day in the future to sell the fifth part in this extraordinary and outstanding series to us.d, they will be able to cope with this, trust me on that.

Rowling explains everything in her spell-binding plots and ultimately you come out with a very well-written, exciting, and suspenseful novel. Indeed it is suspenseful largely because of the book's conclusion and a special event that takes place at Hogwarts during Harry's fourth year. A lot of new ideas are entertained in this book, for example J.K. Rowling has never let any romance develop among her characters but there is certainly some of that in this book. All Harryheads out there must expect this book to be just as good as the others, so I won't talk about the plot much anymore. I'd like to comment though, on the reviews that state Harry Potter as being un-Christian, or violating Christian beliefs. I have heard a lot of things concerning this issue, one particularly farfetched one saying that Harry Potter books have been banned by the pope, and that one could do magic after reading all books. Obviously these are very ludicrous statements, only made by people who have no sense of humor, adventure, daring and imagination. I mean, come on! I live in the Philippines, and I doubt very much that there'd be a Diagon Alley hidden somewhere in Manila, or a Hogwarts castle hiding in the secluded northern islands of my country. Some people just need to get it through their heads that these books are for FUN, we read them to have a bit of a laugh and we learn some pretty good values as well.

Anyway, Goblet is  intense and moves like the giant snakes Harry has encountered. Rowling's  words wrap around you and hold you fixated until the very end. The problem  now that I finished Goblet of Fire is...what will I do until the next  release. I can't stand it! And when it is released, I will be the first GIT  in line for all the TV news cameras to see. Orwell wrote it about Big  Brother, and I will say it about Harry...I love Harry Potter.

Why the heck are they complaining!  They're literature-deficient kids are finally being introduced to books, and all they can do is complain. No,  this book is not satanical. I'm a Christian, not a ddvil-worphipper, mind  you. Why? Because does it have any type of reference to the devil? Well,  Lord Voldemort is really evil, but they're completely unrelated. So what is  they do magic? Are they afraid that they're kids will start practising  magic? Guess what? It doesn't work, haha! Magic, real magic, does not exist  in the hands of people. There are supernatural occurings, but that's  different. It's not caused by a person by their will. The people who are  afraid that this book will encouage anti-Christianism are over-senstive  people, like Ned Flanders.<br />This book is great, better than all the  others. But one thing I'm starting to get disturbed on is the lack of  relevance of Ron Weasley. Harry is the famous wizard who escaped (not  defeated) Lord Voldemort twice, and Hermione Granger is the whiz that aces  every test. But what about poor Ron? He wanted to come to Hogwarts, trying  to become greats like all his brothers, but 4 years has passed, and all  he's done is &quot;assist&quot; Harry on his many quests. I would really  like to see Ms. Rowling give Ron some credit other than being Harry's  sidekick.<br />I won't the story too much away, but the Goblet of Fire is  like a judge. You put your names in it, and it decides the most worthy  champion to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, from the 3 magic  schools of Beauxbatons, Durmstrang and of course, good ol' Hogwarts. Even  though Harry couldn't put his name in it, because he's underage, his name  is somehow entered, and he's chosen. Did some dark wizard put it in so  Harry would die in the dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament? Find out by  reading!<br />The fourth-years change in this book, behaving more like  adolescent teens than naive little kids. They ask for dance partners, get  jealous, you know the whole works. It's depicted very accurately. Overall,  this book is the best of the four, and is easily the best book of the year,  so far. I mean, what's the competition?

The Hobbit use to be my favorite  book, but then I read this one and this book  is by far my most favorite book in the whole universe. I suggest everyone  of every age read this book. It captured my mind and sometimes I would stay  up 'till 2:00 in the morning reading it. Words by far are not good enough  to describe the excellence of this book. So what if it's long? The longer  the better! I wish Harry Potter was a never ending story because it is so  excellent. I wish Harry Potter was real and everything in the story! I wish  I was a wizard going to Hogwarts and be Harry's best friend.There was not  one second I got bored of this book. I have all 4, and I have read them  all. Each book got better as it went along. The second one was better than  the first one, the third was better than the 2nd one, and the 4th one was  better than the 3rd. I am very anxious for the fifth one to come out. Some  people thought this book drags on, but I didn't think it did for one  moment. Don't listen to the people who give this book low ratings, they  obviously do not know what they were talking about. Someone said that kids  just like the book  because everyone else does, and they are not sure if  they really like it. Well that is just a bunch of garbage because I like  the book for everything that's in it, and I don't want J.K. Rowling to stop  writing HP books. If you havn't read this book, it's an absolute must. I  give this book infinaty points.This book is full of action, suspense,  mystery, magic, and anything you could ever dream of!

If you do not like Harry Potter, keep it  to yourself! Don't encourage other people to ban Harry, because if you do,  you are spoiling almost every person's glory in the whole world. I strongly  believe you should read all the Harry Potter books because they will make  your day. It encourages kids to read, even if they hate to read.

The first thing I noticed when I first picked up this book was the sheer mass.  Each book in this installment is gaining girth; at this rate, book 7  should exceed 1000 pages.  I worried that Rowling might be afflicted with  successful writer disease (greater editorial control leading to redundant,  unreadable tomes e.g. Tom Clancy).  My fears proved false.  Each page told  an exciting, deep story that kept me riveted throughout.  And again, I  offer adulation to any writer that can keep children turning hundreds of  pages.<br />My only concern upon completing my reading, was that Goblet of  Fire might be a bit too dark for the youngest readers.  This is the  &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; installment of the series where our heroes  are put through their greatest losses and most dire perils.  Also, much  like the 2nd installment of Star Wars, the conclusion is anything but,  aluding to greater conflict to come.  As before, I encourage parents to  read with their children.  Not only is this something you can share with  them, its definitely an activity of greater benefit than mind-numbing  television sessions.  Finally, any adult who remembers being a child will  enjoy what is turning out to be a seriously good work of storytelling.  Rowling is not underrated; ask your children.	2000-09-09

This book is much  darker than the previous three, yet it's the up and down roller-coaster  that J.K. Rowling takes us on that is so facinating.  The beguining is very  good, it sets the whole mood for the book, and for once it didn't start on  Harry's birthday.  The charactors are deep and well defined, yet they never  cease to surprise us, as many will find Hermione did.  It's hard to get  bored as the story progresses, and people will meat a few new faces, an  anoying reporter, W.I.Ts(wizards in training) from other schools, and, as  always, a new defense against the drk arts teacher.  Another reason this  book is so good is tha Ms. Rowling stopped writing exactly what we wanted  to hear, and there for made us feel the emotions of the charactors more.  I  highly recomend this book, especially for older readers.  My praise goes  out  toMs. rowling for creating another mastrpeice.	2000-09-07

I was especially turned off by the torture  scene.  Also, I felt that the conversations and situations were becoming  much too hateful to be appropriate for most childrien (i.e. the referral to  the death eater whose job it is &quot;destroying dangerous beasts&quot; who  will have &quot;better victims than that soon&quot;, and the talk of being  ready for &quot;a spot of Muggle-torture&quot;).  Overall, this makes me  believe that the this book, and probably the future books if they follow  the same tone, ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN (and probably not for most  adults).  The characters in the books have begun focusing too much on hate,  revenge, lies, and killing (per Malfoy, &quot;Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers  first&quot;).  This has, in fact, turned me completely off the series.  I  will definitely not be looking forward to the next book because in my  opinion there was absolutely nothing about this book that was fun or even  mildly entertaining.	2000-09-07

Next in book  Number 2 JKR is slowing down, Quiditch isn't mentioned as much.  The story  line  is a bit blotchy and the mystery unfolds to quickly together.  Finnaly the best book in the first four, Year 3.  Black is the best  character.  Quiditch is brought back even more and Hagrid is put into the  story better than ever.

The triwizard  cup was very, very stupid.  You would've thought with so many pages ( over  700 )  This woud be the best of the four.  JKR better pick it up. P.S.

My children, ages 8 and 10, anxiously awaited the arrival of the fourth Harry Potter book.  We were enthralled by the first three, but all of us  agree that &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; was very disappointing in several  ways.  For example, there were several subplots which were never really  developed and should have been left out.  An example of this is Herminone's  defense of the House Elves.  I thought that it was in particularly bad  taste to have a magical creature which enjoys being a slave and speaks in a  way which is reminiscent of early depictions of black slaves.  My children  and I had a hard time following the plot, as the book seemed to ramble on  at times.  We were also disturbed at how dark this book was.  Was there a  reason for Cedric's fate? Why was there so much violence, torture, murder,  and profanity in a children's book?  This book also lacked the comic relief  of the other books.  It was no longer fun to be Harry's friend.

Harry Potter captured my interest so much that I am now exploring  other authors to continue this desire to read.  If you know someone who has  struggled with reading in the past I strongly urge you to give him or her  this series.	2000-09-05

This story is another achievement for the author.  She continues to keep the saga fresh and interesting in her 4th Harry Potter book.  Harry and his  friends seem like real children and the active mind of the writer always  has something new and exciting waiting ahead for them in the wizard world.  Yes, this is a big book, but what a wonderful accomplishment for a child to  have tackled and completed the story.

A friend turned me and my wife onto the Potter mania and I must say I have enjoyed it!  We just finished #4 and I wasn't as impressed as with the  others, #3 was my favorite!  I guess my complaint was that of course #4 has  its surprise that you don't expect and twists all your expectations you  have developed about the characters up to that point.  The only problem in  #4 was that the shock was so far off and seperated from the main plot that  it took the next 20 pages to explain, and catch up, with how this even  could have happened.  It felt like the previous 500 pages were a waste.  Don't get me wrong, I like surprises, I just felt like I was left out of  the building up to the surprise. I understand this is a children's book and  adults are often over critical considering the book's intended audience.  I  will definetly read the Potter series too the end!	2000-09-05

But, enough about that.  Book four is here, and once again, my three girls  went into a deep state of Pottermania, and there is no vaccine for that.  I've checked.  My whole family enjoys reading the series, as it truly is  great family entertainment.<br />Once again, we find Harry at the his aunt and  uncle's home, but this time, he is picked up by the Weasleys, and taken to  the Quidditch World Cup, the Super Bowl of the wizard world.  After the  match, the dark mark of Lord Voldermont is seen in the sky, and wizards  panic everywhere.<br />Back at Hogwarts, Harry is mysteriously entered into  the Triwizard Tournament, and he is suddenly forced to compete in highly  dangerous tasks for the honor of his school.  The action throughout the  book is quite intense, and the excellent writing makes it really difficult  to put it down.  I turned pages so quickly that I didn't even notice the  737 pages.<br />All of the regulars are back, and some interesting new ones  are added in quite nicely.  In the Goblet of Fire, we finally meet  Voldermont face to face, as he tries once again to bring Harry to an  untimely death.  Slowly, Voldermont is gathering up his supporters, setting  up the upcomming fifth book quite nicely.  The classic conflict of good vs.  evil is sensationally defined, and it will be quite interesting to see  where certain characters eventually side.<br />This novel has something for  everybody, as the suspense is incredible as usual.  The Goblet of Fire is,  by far, the darkest book of the series so far, as it deals with difficult  topics like cheating and death, but J. K. Rowling weaves it together so  well, you can't help but enjoy this book.  This well written book is a must  read for any household that has children in it.  It won't let you down.  Pottermania is everywhere.	2000-09-05

As a big fan of Harry Potter series I have enjoyed this book very much, but it left me with a very ambivalent feeling, which already surfaced as I  was reading the Prisoner of Azkaban. The last few books touch upon very  serious issues: betrayal, death, murder. The question of morality is always  addressed, and not in a silly way either. Unfortunately, the book follows  an almost Hollywood storyline, where no matter what the protagonist does -  he survives and comes back better then ever, with an exception that here he  does not get the girl. Alas. A little less predictability would be nice, as  well as moving on to new villains, perhaps?  The book is a worthy read  nevertheless, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone and everyone who  reads books.	2000-09-04

They just like it not because the book is good but everyone else  thinks its good, and that's not very good on today's generation.

At  first I resisted and said that they couldn't be all that they were cracked  up to be, but I can now tell you just how wrong I was.

Rowling made this book so LONG.  It's over 700 pages.  I don't really have a problem with long books if that's the amount  of space they need to write a compelling story, but this plot drags in too  many places.  There were several times where I began to get bored and had  to force myself to keep reading, or where I became so distracted that I had  to re-read the same part because I hadn't been interested enough to pay  attention.  This book could have been edited down to a much quicker, more  compelling story.<br />HOWEVER, other than that I think it was a wonderful  novel.  It had all the creative, fascinating elements that made the first 3  so great.  Floo powder, blast ended skrewts, the students from Durmstrang  and Beauxbatons, the Weasley family, etc. are all unforgettable elements.<br />This sequel was also much darker than the other 3, particularly at the  end.  This didn't bother me, actually I thought it was awesome, but it  might be a bit difficult for parents to explain to young children.  First  of all, several characters are killed, including an innocent old man and a  student at Harry's school, who readers have grown to like.  The evil Lord  Voldemort stages a terrifying, and successful, return to power, involving a  disturbing dark ritual which includes self mutilation by one of his  followers.  Voldemort then rounds up his followers and attempts to kill  Harry in a rather terrifying scene.  However, this end scene is also one of  the best parts of the book.  It is powerful and well written, drawing the  reader in and leaving you unable to stop until the last page.  This ending  was what made the whole book worthwhile to me, because this is where  everything comes together into a cohesive whole (not just elements of this  book, but of all the 4 Harry Potter novels), answering most of the  questions but leaving enough open for the next sequel to continue.<br />This  series is growing from an innocent tale of a young boy who discovers he has  amazing powers and legendary parents, to a powerful story of good vs. evil,  much like the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies.  I recommend it to anyone who  enjoys a good sci-fi, fantasy, children's novel, or just a good story  overall.overs he has  amazing powers and legendary parents, to a powerful story of good vs. evil,  much like the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies.

Anyone who says this book  is UNREALISTIC, is in for a big shock. IT'S FANTASY - OF COURSE IT'S  UNREALISTIC. Though this book was double the size of Book 3 and took a  while to get started, when it does, you CANNOT put it down. Harry is just  as adorably confused as before (even more so, with the introduction of Cho)  Ron is just as degraded and envious as always (watch out for sparks between  the 2!)and Hermione (how the HECK do you say her name?) is just as brainy  and intense as before (new word - S.P.E.W). You can expect that little  you-know-what Draco Malfoy to be as hideous as his name and his clonies,  Crabbe and Goyle (what convenient names) to be as lamebrained as always.  Rita Skeeter is a real WITCH and Hagrid gets a taste of romance. For all  Quidditch fans -  you can look forward to Harry being on the sidelines in  this book, as he cheers on Ireland in the Quidditch World Cup, coming to  you at a lovely deserted moor. With Anti-Muggle charms and the introduction  of Portkeys, you would expect nothing to go wrong. But expect just the  opposite! The only thing I can't understand is why they have a Muggle smack  dab in the centre of this. You'll know what I'm talking about when you read  the book. A nice, new touch to the Hogwarts scene is Rita Skeeter, reporter  for the Daily Prophet. The book is filled with her articles, made very  untruthful by her Quick-Quotes Quill. Three of our favorite characters get  dragged through the mud! Ah, l'amore! Finally, Harry is acting like a  normal boy, having set his eyes on Cho, fellow Ravenclaw Seeker, and a  fifth year. Three new words - Auror, Death-Eater and the Dark Mark. Three  new magic words - Priori Incantatem, the Pensieve and Veritaserum. Also,  the return of Padfoot and Wormtail.<br />Filled to the brim with new things,  this book will be read and reread despite its size. Enjoy!	2000-09-02

In hand was the fourth book in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot;  series.  Elderly Gentlemen were asking me (I'm 38) about the book.  They  were excited.  Several commented that it has their Grandchildren reading.  We need to encourage our youth to read.  If we can find books as exciting  and enchanting as these, than let's keep going.  As a child I read books by  C.S. Lewis and others that helped me to understand life a lot better.  My  Mother bought me book one of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and I scowled.  This  is a kids book I told her.  Then I finally read it.  Wow!  I could hardly  wait to see what would happen next.  I blasted thru the first 3 books then  had to wait (Anxiously) for 6 months for book 4.  They say if it is worth  having it is worth waiting.  Well I truely agree.  I now await the rest of  the series, while I try to find books of interest from others.  I may live  in the year 2000, but I love things like Kings and Queens, Southern Belles,  etc.  Why, beecause Chivalry Lives, even in the 21st Century Star Trek Era.

Harry Potter defeats  Voldemort again and is the hero of everything again). But it seems to me  it's getting more inappropriate for children. I'm not talking about the  size of the book (which is longer than CRIME AND PUNISHMENT). The language  is getting stronger. There is more cursing in the fourth than in the first  three combined. And the violence. If yuo thought the three were violent  that was baby stuff compared to this. Honestly, I know a mother who is  reading this to her first grader and stopped in middle. She expected it to  be okay for her but it wasn't. Come on I know someone out there agrees with  me. What is all the hype about.

But Don't Bite Me For a Few Observations	The Harry Potter books have been pursuing me. Like Tom Riddle's diary (*Chamber of Secrets*), they just won't go away.  Finally I peeked at  *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (which had been slyly lurking by my  desk just waiting to be found) and I was lost. Over a thousand pages later,  I had negotiated all the books, going without sleep to finish *The Goblet  of Fire* -- even eating as I turned the pages (I got chili all over my  shirt).  These books are *good*.  These books make me want to be fourteen  again (what more could I possibly say?), and to go to Hogswarts.  Heck, I  want it all!  I want an owl.  I want an invisibility cloak.  I want a  broom. I want to marry Bill Weasley even though I'm old enough to be his  mother.  But most of all, like the children who read these books, I want  the family romance to come true.  Surely my true parents were witches and  wizards -- how could it not be? And how can I get a lightning bolt scar  without cheating?<br />But I have some minor (don't send me Howlers!) quibbles  with all the books.  Like Hermione, I'm not pleased with the care of  magical creatures, and I'm pretty darn uncomfortable with those house elves  who are happy being slaves and can't handle their freedom.  It's a little  too much in bad taste (I'm avoiding the &quot;r&quot; word like crazy).  Then there's the hippogriff that's going to be executed for scratching a  disobedient and nasty student.  We have benign garden gnomes that are swung  until dizzy and then thrown a distance of fifty feet.  There's an illicit  trade in dragons' eggs -- though we know in book 4 that dragons are  protective of those eggs.  Stores sell dragon liver by the pound. Unicorns  have their tail hairs put into wands (so do phoenixes) and Unicorn blood  drunk by you-know-who.  Mandrakes seem very human indeed, but their fate is  to be chopped up into bits.  Spiders are nasty.  Snakes don't do well in  this world.  The bottom line is that the wizard world of Harry Potter  treats its magical creatures the way our human world, for the most part,  treats its unmagical creatures.  Which is to say, not well. They appear to  exist only to be used by the wizards and witches. I don't like that.<br />But  I love the book.  Will it stand the test of time?  I don't know.  But I do  know that this dark, nightmarish, funny, quirky book makes for a great  read. Read it, read it more than once.

There is  real cruelty in this book, fratricide, and the death of an admirable  character essentially because he is so admirable.  Also, I wonder why we  read so much about James Potter and how much Harry resembles him, and Lilly  Potter gets almost no credit for Harry, other than his eyes.  Maybe I  notice that more as a mom.

I read all four Harry Potter books during the course of a holiday in the US. I loved them from the moment I opened Book 2 (the airport bookshop  didn't have Book 1), but this is the best yet! Incidentally, any scornful  Malfoy-type who says Harry Potter is just for kids and sad adults who need  to grow up (I haven't actually heard anyone say that) can go eat their  words, because I am 17 and I think they are a considerable improvement on  sliced bread.<br />In this fourth book, JK Rowling continues to deal with  increasingly adult themes as her characters grow older. These include the  much-trumpeted death (I won't say whose) and typical secondary school  boy/girl action, which might put off some younger readers (under-tens  maybe). Older readers, however, will sympathise with Harry and Ron's  frustrations as they try to find dates for the Yule Ball (I agree, Harry,  giggling definitely should be made illegal!).<br />As for the actual plot,  this is elegantly crafted as in the previous three books and there are more  shocks and scares than ever in the final chapters. Once again, the wealth  of little details about the wizarding world helps to make it all seem  real.<br />I have only one complaint to make, which is that I will now have to  wait nearly a year for Book 5! How will I survive with no new wizarding  adventures for so long(unless the movie comes out before then, which seems  unlikely)? Maybe I'll just have to try crashing a trolley into the ticket  barrier between platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross....	2000-08-24

It actually takes  you into the stories yourself where you share yourself with Harry,  Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, EVERYONE! You cry at the sad parts, you laugh at the  funny ones, you get anxious and can't stop reading! I actually try to make  it last as long as I can because when it's done, it's done (though I've  read them over and over again) and then all the adventure and magic is gone  and you're back to the stupid muggle world again! This is the best book I  have ever read. Someother of my favorites are Dr.Dolittle, which is a  marvelous fantastically written fantacy novel like the Harry Potter novels;  the other novel that is my favorites is Harriette the Spy which is a lot  like Harry Potter because it is a fantacy, mystery, etc. all mixed together  in a perfect combination! And those  examples, I think, explain the way I  think about the Harry Potter! Sometimes you wish that Ms.Rowling's world  could be real so much that you actually get yourself thinking it actually  is real, and it's a real slap-in-the-face when you step back into reality.  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is my favorite one of the  four, but they're all very good. I MOST DEFINITELY recommend that you read  the books. You get to know the people inside the book and, I must tell you,  it's like making new friends!  I'm sure that Ms. Rowling surely knows that  so many children look up to her, but for some reason, I have to get this  out. This may seem very stupid, indeed, but she is somewhat like a hero and  a great friend of mine and I thank her graciously for letting me and many  others take a small step out of reality for a while! It really means a lot  to me. Ms. Rowling, you are a remarkable person and I thank you not only  for me, but for all the children out there who look up to you!

This has to be within my recent memory the most overhyped and overrated piece of fiction, juvenile or  otherwise.  I recall the evening of its  first day, and being in a Brooklyn coffee shop and seeing single adults  enraptured in a manner comparable to when &quot;GWTW&quot; first appeared  in 1936. Back then, Scarlett was an unknown quantity, whereas Harry is now  a pop icon.  However I am sorry to say the hoopla attendant to his fourth  appearance is not justified.  The story is  overwritten, taking a good  hundred or more pages to really  get going, it needs judicious editing, and  while dark and grim in spots, Rowling is never as daring as we had all  anticipated she would be.  When death does occur, as indeed it does, the  impact is less than I might have imagined.  The first three  Potters got to the point and told their stories.  They held one spellbound,  like serial cliffhangers, always wanting more.  Book number four gives too  much of a good thing, missing the mark maintained by the others.  It is  amazing to me how the average child will have the patience to wade through  a tome larger than what the average adult reads.  Will I  read number5?  Of course. With characters having seeped into our  consciousness, there is no way Pottermania can be stopped.  Too bad that  number four,  claimed to be the &quot;turning point&quot; in the series,  delivers less than what seemed to be promised.	2000-08-24

Many will say that it is full of  antichristian views and even satanic. I read recently, in an news article I  recieved from a friend of mine, that the book is sparking satanism in  children and that J.K. Rowling is a satanist herself who made some pretty  anti-christian comments, I for one believe that this is ludicrous, a book  supporting the struggle of good over evil where good always wins is not  exactly a satanic view. Also there is a quote in the fourth book where  Albus Dumbledor says &quot;curiosity is not a sin.&quot; That is not  satanic, or ant-ichristian, no matter how you may try to put it. This whole  ,Harry Potter is wichcraft and non christian, is stupid, but you never  know. The only way to find out is to talk to the woman herself. The book  itself was absolutely fantastic. I read it in two days, and it, as its  predecessors left just enough room for the fifth book wich will probably be  recieved even more fanatically than this one. The only thing that could be  a turnoff is the death, I won't disclose the information as to who, but I  will say that it makes sense. It's not as if the character could have  escaped, that would have been difficult to do, and their character forbids  them to act differently than he did, causing them to be put into their  prediciment. I always read the book to my mom and my sister and toward the  middle of the story my mom asked who the person who put Harry's name in the  goblet was. I asked if she really wanted to know, and told her that she  would still be suprised in the end even if I did. Wich is true, the suprise  twist at the end infuriates and at first confuses but only adds to the  wonderfull suspense only Rowling can weave into her wrighting. I would  recomend this book to a slightly older audience than the first three but it  was still fantastic.	2000-08-24

Well, let me try a different approach, pitching this review to those of you avoiding  &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; (as well as the series) because you don't care  much for the fantasy genre, let alone the kind that works so many kids into  a frenzy.<br /> I never cared much for fantasy myself. It was always difficult  to work up interest in works that created umpteen different little  characters, with varying powers and talents, scattered across lands that  are only clearly imagined in the author's head.  Maps,appendices,  glossaries -- who needs all that!  But then comes this wonderful,  insanely imaginative writer named J.K. Rowling.  Oh J.K., what have you  done to me?  Turned me into a reader of books that kids are wild about!  But more importantly... how?  Well, here's what I suspect:<br /> Rowling,  unlike many other fantasy authors, has been clever enough to capture a  sense of BALANCE between her fantasy world and the real world that we all  share.  Hogwart's, for all it's magical passageways, ghosts, and other  quirks, IS in many ways similar to the real schools and colleges that we  have attended.  The magic and witchcraft professors share many odd and  charming traits that you DO see in their real-life counterparts (and as an  academic, I can assure you, there really ARE Lockharts, Dumbledores,  Trelawneys, and Snapes out there!).  Every kid has in one way or another  seen home as a sort of &quot;prison&quot; at times, and longed for some  degree of power over situations.  The magic of Harry Potter is the magic of  our own human aspirations.  And it is put forth in a world that, while  fantastical, has enough similarity to our own that we can feel very much  more a part of it.  I know, I know, the Potter books have become a huge  mass-market success... but Rowling is a major literary talent even in spite  of all that hoopla.  Moreover, she was clever enough to anticipate the  paranoia of some readers over books about wizards and witches, and gently  but deservedly parodies them in the form of certain &quot;muggles.&quot;  So if you think fantasy is not for you, please give Harry Potter a try...  these books really DO live up to all the hype they've been receiving.  And  thanks J.K., for showing a world of readers that magic does exist in every  nook and cranny of our lives!over books about wizards and witches, and gently  but deservedly parodies them in the form of certain &quot;muggles.&quot;  So if you think fantasy is not for you, please give Harry Potter a try...  these books really DO live up to all the hype they've been receiving.

I am also very pleased  that so much of it was kept secret and that I managed to avoid any spoilers  until after I was done.

Harry is definitely getting older, and it shows in this book.<br />In  Harry Potter IV, the story gets deeper, the plot thickens, and the evil is  more serious.

In the 1st 3 books I thought it would be great to be part of the wizard  world and be able to go off to Hogwarts to study under the famed Albus  Dumbledore. After the Mad Eye Moody switch, however, I have no faith that  Dumbledore actually is Dumbledore or that Hogwarts is any better than the  streets of NYC.  Might as well be a Muggle.  Book 4 is nothing more than  another Star Wars story with Harry Potter as Luke Skywalker and Voldmort as  Darth Vader.  I liked Harry Potter originally because I wanted to enter  into a world of magic.  In the 4th book I found myself reading a crime  story and it filled my head up with children dying and adults tricking and  abusing children. It reaffirmed for me that it is better not to trust  anyone. Certainly not the adults that are &quot;pretending&quot; to be your  protector.  What will happen next?

When I first heard about Harry Potter through my mother who  wanted to give the audio cassette as a Christmas gift to my 8 year-old son,  I was a bit doubtful.  My son had learned how to read in English and French  but couldn't make the transition to novels without pictures and would only  read Asterix or Tintin.  The audio cassette got him hooked and soon we were  both listening to it, then gradually reading as we listened and at the end  he was following on his own.  The following books were all read without the  audio versions and he read the last in a mere week.  Having read the books  myself I find them very exciting and challenging in many respects: the  vocabulary is varied and advanced without dragging down the story.  The  author uses great creativity in choosing the names of characters, sports,  localities etc.  The plot is very closely knit and very credible (as long  as you believe in the premise of magic).  The background is one most can  relate to: there is a strong sense of family, values of friendship,  responsibilities of school, excitement of sports... in short it is the life  of most young boys with magic thrown in, not to make life easier, on the  contrary. Harry battles with incredible foes and must show integrity and  courage to succeed.  In a way he is a hero that boys can relate to, not a  strong, powerful man but a simple BOY, not particularly good-looking or  cute, (he wears glasses and has unruly hair) who must go to school and  learn and has his share of problems to solve as in being sometimes shunned  by others or by his best friend, not suceeding in certain subjects, having  a teacher hate him and all the other problems with Voldermort.  These books  have taught my son to enjoy reading, the greatest accomplishment of all.  I  have mixed emotions about a movie.  Will the children simply wait for the  movie version to come out instead of reading and IMAGINING the stories?INING the stories?	2000-08-22

Sometimes it is exactly the same as they  would react here and now.  In order to veil the morality a bit more  strongly you might have some current thoughts and actions removed, only to  be replaced by others with the same motivations.This book took compelling  characters and put them in a setting of existing government, society,  sensibilities and prejudices then renamed them.  Some magic was thrown in.I  enjoyed the book even though it felt like a 700 page setup for book 5.  Some of that may be because Harry is older and not every issue is black and  white.  Darker grey can't be changed by single heroic acts.	2000-08-22

And yes, it's also much better than I expected. I  was sceptical about the author's ability to write the fourth book because  of all the pressure of so many people breathlessly waiting for it...Also,  the first 3 books covered all sorts of stuff, had many twists &amp; turns,  lots of humour, &amp; lots of information on the characters. So I thought  it was kind of hard to match up to all that. Was I right? No!(luckily for  me &amp; everybody else)<br />I think the Goblet of Fire is the best, so far,  in the series, for 2 simple reasons: a) it's almost tripple the size of the  previous books (it resembles a small dictionary &amp; almost scares you off  when you first lay eyes on it) so it's even bigger a success, since  J.K.Rowling manages to keep you surprised &amp; anxious throughout the  whole thing &amp; b) this book marks a sort of turning point in the series,  which you'll find out when reaching the last page. But enough said already.  If you belong to the small minority that hasn't yet enjoyed the Harry  Potter books, stop resisting &amp; start reading: it's one of those few  cases when being in the minority doesn't have anything good about it-  you're just missing a rare treat!	2000-08-21

I wrote a review on book 1 only  FEW SHORT WEEKS AGO!  It certainly did not take me long - 2 days to finish #4. Now that I am more familiar with the characters, a few things I  would love to see in #5.  First, can we please find out a little more about  Dumbledore, and Snape (actually starting to like the snake)and Professor  McGonnagall.  I think it's time.  They are such an intricate part and it  would be nice to find out a little bit more about them.  And hopefully  Rowling will grant our wishes.  She certainly sets it up in book 4 - there  are tidbits all over the book on the stories of these 3 important figures  in Harry's life, but we get waylaid.  I actually liked the  &quot;darkness&quot; of the book, the layers are building on each other.  And for those of us with romantic hearts, you can even find a little of  that too (even if it's 14 year old romance). I certainly hope she is  working on #5...	2000-08-21

Rowling-Junkies all over the world.  I scoffed at her (yes, really, I scoffed), saying that I, nor could she,  find amusement and temptation in a series of books that my ten-year old  sister has been reading.  So, in order to understand the frenzy and mania  over Harry Potter, I played devil's advocate and picked up the first book  in the series...and did not put it down until I finished it, four hours  later.  Though clearly a childern's book, it is also clearly an age-less  classic, that will remain as famous and cherrished as Tolkien's, 'The  Hobbit.'  I quickly read the next three books in the series, and found  each to be as unique and intriguing as Harry Potter himself.  Ms. Rowling  is a genius; simple, pure and honest.  I find myself anticipating the  fifth book as if I were again a child...and perhaps that's the charisma of  the Harry Potter books-it awakens the long-sleeping child that dwells  within us all.	2000-08-21

When I first saw Harry Potter in our library, I barely even picked up a finger to get it, and in consequence, I wasn't the first to read it...  However, after that, it was like a flood of people were at our library to  read it, and in the desperation for the 2nd book, I forgot about the  library and bought it myself...  Then the third...  However, after finding  out that it would be another year before the 4th and I was always thinking  about it, I knew I was hooked.  The fourth book is definitely the best yet,  detailing Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts.  However, there is a  surprise in the beginning, which I will not state, to contain the suspense  for other readers.  While at Hogwarts, Harry and the gang find out that the  Quidditch Cup tournament was canceled, but it was replaced by the Triwizard  Tournament, where the best 3 schools compete to win. Even though it may be  700+ pages, it will be worth the read, adults, and children will both be  drawn into J.K. Rowling's intricate web of mystery and imagination.

More appropriate would have been,  \\"Mum the bank doesn't give a blasted ended skrewt how I dress as long as I  bring home plenty of treasure.

One student from each school is chosen but you have to be  older than 17 to do it. The tournament hasn't gone on for over a century  because of casualties. Someone (Crouch's Son) has entered Harry's name as  another school and there is four contestants insteed of three. Harry Potter  (Hogwarts), Cedric Diggory (Hogwarts), Fleur Delacour (Beauxbaton),and  Viktor Krum (Durmstrang) are to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament!

Warning: You must read all of the other 3 first or it will be very  confusing and one of the contestants in the end will be killed by Lord  Voldemort (also known as Tom Marvolo Riddle).:) It's a wonderful book!

Her prose is nothing  spectacular, but her characters draw me right in, and it's as if for a few  hours at a time, I become Harry Potter and feel what he feels.  J.K.  Rowling is now officially the third of my very favorite fantasy authors  ever - right up there with Orson Scott Card and Terry Goodkind (though be  warned, Goodkind's series is adult only and a LOT darker).<br />  Let me  just emphasize I am not a blind lover of all fantasy out there - many of  the popular authors, especially Robert Jordan and David Eddings, make me  want to retch.  I honestly can't see how people can read one of their  shallow books and have any desire to continue another page into the series.  Rowling, however, is far from anything close to Shallow or trite.<br />  Now for my specific comments about this book - it was too short!  Yes, yes  I know...but those 734 pages went by about as quick as one page of Eddings.  As usual, I enjoyed the surprise at the end, and am becoming especially  intrigued at Harry and Ron's relationship to Hermione.  I was honestly  disappointed when Rowling started hinting at some potential for romance  between Hermione and Ron(and isn't Victor Krum a bit old for her!  We're  talking statutory here!) - I was always kind of hoping she would end up  with Harry in one of the last books in the series(and I hope he eventually  forgets about that bimbo Cho Chang), but the ambiguous last page of this  one gave me a bit of hope for that.  But mostly, I'm disappointed that  I'll have aged another year before the next book.  Only Goodkind's next  book can hope to keep me entertained for a short while longer.  Yes, once  again Harry Potter has become one of my all time favorite series'.

But quite simply, the  extrodinary and sensational &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire&quot;  leaves the previous books In the dust.  From the opening chapter you  realise this Isn't going to be your average Harry Potter book, a character  suspected of murder Is himself murdered at the hands of Lord Voldemort.  I  had always felt a Harry potter novel didn't get exciting until the story  reached Hogwarts, this time Harry, Ron and Hermione travel to see a  Qudditch World Cup which doesen't leave you dosing off waiting for the  Hogwarts Express.  But from then on the pace becomes consistently quicker,  Harry's name Is put In a &quot;Goblet Of Fire&quot;  which chooses  contestants for a tournament involving other schools of witchcraft and  wizardry.  Harry is helped throughout the tournament by a new teacher  &quot;Mad Eye Moody&quot;  someone who you begin to trust throughout the  story.  Harry makes his way through the tournament tasks and unexpectactly  finds himself face to face with Lord Voldemort, resulting In the death of  not a prominant, but significant character.  By the end things have got so  messy you can only cringe at the things which are no doubt to come. This Is  by far the most compelling instalment In the series.  I've read critics  complain Rowling Is writing directly at a more adult audience, this Is  definetely not the case; For a start, Rowling already holds a huge adult  audience with these books, parents enjoy them just as much as their  children, also (like Harry himself) Rowling's prime audience of 8 to 12  year olds are growing up as well, I think It's fitting that children can  grow up with these stories as they themselves become more mature.  Although  for especially young children of anyone under seven, parents should  defineteley read along, the last hundred or so pages can be frightning and  sometimes shocking.  And as Dumbledore explains the stories events to Harry  (and readers) Rowling has you flipping back hundreds of pages to realise  just how intricately intwined the plot really Is.  Simply an amazing read  from cover to cover, &quot;The Goblet Of Fire&quot; Is to the previous  Instalments what &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was to &quot;Star  Wars&quot;, It gives the series deeper meaning and makes an already  enjoying tale Into something better than you thought It could be.ries as they themselves become more mature.

We can't shut our eyes to things  we think are bad forever.  Rowling's plots are brilliant and never  predictable.  I can't wait for book 5.	2000-08-19

It isn't often that an author produces a series of books where each new book is better than the last, but J. K. Rowling does it consistently.  The  Harry Potter books are wonderful for a variety of reasons, but the chief  one is that Rowling writes what she would like to read.  The Goblet of Fire  is the longest and darkest of the series to date, but a brilliant  transitional book.  There were three passages in the book that literally  reduced me to tears, while others made me laugh out loud.

But quite simply, the  extrodinary and sensational &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire&quot;  leaves the previous books In the dust.  From the opening chapter you  realise this Isn't going to be your average Harry Potter book, a character  suspected of murder Is himself murdered at the hands of Lord Voldemort.  I  had always felt a Harry potter novel didn't get exciting until the story  reached Hogwarts, this time Harry, Ron and Hermione travel to see a  Qudditch World Cup which doesen't leave you dosing off waiting for the  Hogwarts Express.  But from then on the pace becomes consistently quicker,  Harry's name Is put In a &quot;Goblet Of Fire&quot;  which chooses  contestants for a tournament involving other schools of witchcraft and  wizardry.  Harry is helped throughout the tournament by a new teacher  &quot;Mad Eye Moody&quot;  someone who you begin to trust throughout the  story.  Harry makes his way through the tournament tasks and unexpectactly  finds himself face to face with Lord Voldemort, resulting In the death of  not a prominant, but significant character.  By the end things have got so  messy you can only cringe at the things which are no doubt to come. This Is  by far the most compelling instalment In the series.  I've read critics  complain Rowling Is writing directly at a more adult audience, this Is  definetely not the case; For a start, Rowling already holds a huge adult  audience with these books, parents enjoy them just as much as their  children, also (like Harry himself) Rowling's prime audience of 8 to 12  year olds are growing up as well, I think It's fitting that children can  grow up with these stories as they themselves become more mature.  Although  for especially young children of anyone under seven, parents should  defineteley read along, the last hundred or so pages can be frightning and  sometimes shocking.  And as Dumbledore explains the stories events to Harry  (and readers) Rowling has you flipping back hundreds of pages to realise  just how intricately intwined the plot really Is.  Simply an amazing read  from cover to cover, &quot;The Goblet Of Fire&quot; Is to the previous  Instalments what &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was to &quot;Star  Wars&quot;, It gives the series deeper meaning and makes an already  enjoying tale Into something better than you thought It could be.	2000-08-19

Like so many other adults I have enjoyed following Harry through his first three years at Hogwarts.  However, Ms. Rowling's latest installment came up  quite short of her previous books.  Her prose makes for easy reading and  her knack for creating tension and anticipation are undeniable, but with  &quot;Goblet,&quot; she seems to haven fallen in a bit of formulatic trap:  Harry is unhappy during his summer vacation - he gets back to Hogwarts and  everyone is mean to him - Harry is in mortal danger - Hagrid needs cheering  up - there is a show down with Voldemort which the rest of the wizard world  never finds out about - Harry is comforted by his best friends.  I think  there was a great book in Goblet. Unfortunately, not enough time was  devoted to the development of the characters of Harry, Ron &amp; Hermione.  Rather oddly, they were much more shallow in this latest installment. I'm  cheering for Harry, and therefore, hope Ms. Rowling tightens up her writing  in the several books.	2000-08-19

Well, they aren't, they can easily be  enjoyed by adults as well.<br />As I was saying I had put off reading the  Potter series until 5 days ago; I had spent the last 5 days staying up till  3 AM (yes i woke up at noon, but thats beyond the point)each day, reading  these books. They are highly addictive and fun. While the story outline is  always predictable: Harry has unpleasant life with Dursleys, Harry goes to  Hogwarts where he faces challanges that only HE and his friends can solve,  Harry manages to defeat great evil, in one way or another, Harry is praised  by everyone (except the Slytherins). The storyLINE is full of surprises.  You can never tell who the main &quot;villain&quot; is, until the end...  This coupled with the fact that the book's focus is always around Harry (so  you don't have to follow 5 story-lines at once) and Rowling's great sense  of humor makes for some very addictive reading. The nature of the magic in  these books is less &quot;realistic&quot; than in other fantasy books,  because it doesn't really follow any specific rules but if you don't take  it too seriously it shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of the books. So  far these books have proved to be entertaining, I sincerely (sp?) hope that  Rowling keeps this up.	2000-08-18

Hundreds of pages  about a contest that essentially takes place on three specific days.  And  we are expected to believe that two other heads of magical schools would  leave their own schools for an entire school year, just to sit at Hogwarts  waiting for the contest days?  And what did the extra students, those not  selected for the tournament, do all year?  And most importantly, why didn't  the Traitor simply give Harry a portkey at the beginning?

The \\"Goblet of Fire\\" is great, maybe even the BEST of the Harry Potter books. Like all the books The Goblet of Fire  is about growing and learning - it is about discovering your own powers and  talents. But it is especially about how to be human, how to develop into a  better human being, how to enhance your personal character. While it is  tempting to always strive to win at others expense, The Goblet of Fire  teaches people of all ages also the virtue of teamwork, of true friendship,  and of overcoming challenges and discovering your inner greatness. It is a  book about PERSONAL GROWTH and  SELF-DISCOVERY!<br />As usual Harry discovers  the secrets and acts heroically. Lots of twists and turns and big  surprises. You MUST read this book!  I know it is longer than the other 3  books - BUT IT IS WORTH IT!  This is a book for the ages - a must read for  people of all ages (I confess I am an adult - and I loved it).<br />ANOTHER  BOOK I highly recommend is: \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel  &amp; Shya Kane. This book is the most simple and yet magical and enjoyable  book I have ever read about Self-Discovery. It is not a novel, but it is  about the Principles that allow you to easily discover how to continue to  grow and discover your own greatness, whether young or old. It helps you to  have your life be an ongoing learning process and self-discovery process.  It is also about becoming your true self...as one of the authors has said, it  is about learning how to BECOME YOUR OWN PERSONAL HERO. It is really a  Practical Guide to having a Magical Life!  If you have been feeling a bit  like a \\"Muggle\\" lately - READ both \\"Working On Yourself Doesn't Work\\" and  \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" and discover how to re-claim the MAGIC in your life!	2000-08-16

One of the things about this series that I enjoy so much is that the aging  of the characters is handled realistically and in good literary style.

The characters continue to develop, Harry's new experiences (the Quidditch  World Cup, for example) pique our interest, and new and better plot twists  emerge. However, those who have not yet read this book should be warned  that it is not like the others. This one is darker, as the author has  warned us, and murder becomes a distinct theme and very real possibility  for the characters, and for this reason may be a little advanced for the  youngest readers. I would like to stress, though, that it is still not  satanic (as some would have you believe); on the contrary, strong messages  of trust and friendship are conveyed-- conveyed, not preached, there's a  difference-- and the characters apparently observe Christian holidays.<br />The most unbelievable thing about this series is the complexity of the  plots. During the seven-hour period I spent without food, sleep, or human  contact so as to get through the whole thing (I just couldn't put it down),  I stopped once in a while to wonder just how the author could possibly have  come up with some of this stuff. Let's just hope she saved enough for the  next three books.<br />Oh, and one more thing: does anyone else suspect  Hagrid has an American accent?	2000-08-15

When I finished the  article, I got even more interested about Harry and so I bought a paper  back copy of the first book, thinking at the same time that that was a  brilliant marketing strategy (spending I think 4 pages on the review).  To  my surprise, I was really taken aback by the eloquent storytelling that Ms.  JK Rowling has introduced me into. I was hooked from page 1 of the first  book to the last pages of the fourth.  I had my 9 year old (at the time)  daughter, Kathlene, read the book, and she, too, was enthralled by it, and  so I shared books 2 and 3 with her, and we couldn't wait for book 4 to be  published.  When I bought book 4, my daughter and I alternately read it and  shared the excitement of the adventures of our new pal, Harry Potter,  taking precautions not to overread lest one of us would be left on a steep  cliffhanger.  But I couldn't help it, so I went and finished book 4 ahead  of my daughter though I was a bit anxious that there will be no more Harry  Potter magic left for the days ahead until next year in book 5. I could  hardly wait.  Again.  My daughter, being a little bit more conservative,  enjoying every detail of Harry's adventures, finished the book 3 more days  or so after I did.<br />Harry Potter books deserve 5 stars for taking us all  into a fun adventure in the magical world.

Rowlings  ability to sustain the suberbly consistent nature of the series can not be  questioned. I was not suprised to see that Rowling had, this time,  surpassed herself. The Goblet of fire is charming, funny and intelligent.  The Quidditch world cup and indeed the game of Quidditch itself is a stroke  of genius, as is the school of Hogwarts. The real beauty of the book  however lies in the ease with which the story flows, the humour of all the  characters, most notably the Weasley twins (THANK GOD FOR FRED AND  GEORGE!), the warmth of Dumbledore and Hagrid and the bravery of Harry,  Ron, Hermione and even Neville all intertwine with a well crafted story to  be enjoyed by both wizards and muggles.

In my opinion, this is the best Harry Potter book in the series. The endings in books 1 and 2 were kind of rushed. The ending in book 3 had  Harry facing different kinds of challenges, and it was more creative, but  it was kind of like a bridge to Goblet Of Fire. Goblet of Fire has a kind  of ending you might be waiting for after reading the other books, but if  you can guess all the details of how things play out, you should give  yourself a lot of credit. Plus, you are really getting to the meat of the  series. Your imagination is fed with additional interesting characters and  creatures in book 4. Harry Potter And The Goblet of fire contains the  funniest scene in the whole series, near the beginning. The darkest moments  in book 4 are more graphic and tense than before, but much of the book is  not that way. And you will be cheering for the good guys at two very  satisfying moments at the conclusion of the book. Let's just say that  people who deserve bad things happening to them get theirs. One thing that  makes Rowling's books so good is how fantasy is mixed with reality.  Characters have very human emotions and situations, even though they have  magic powers. So therefore, it's still not a bland perfect world, but it's  certainly more fun than ours. Rowling uses creatures and items found in  other literature, but she melds them together in her own way. I advise  reading the other three books first (the second is my least favorite, but  it's still solid Harry Potter), and enjoy! There is some explanation, but  the author does not go into enough detail to cover such a big and involved  book. These books are not just for people who are not adults. The writing  is not hard writing, but it may have to be explained for young kids. J.K.  Rowling tells her story in a way that doesn't seem too immature for older  readers. But it retains the kind of action-packed entertainment value that  children like. There are a lot of glimpses of the adult world. Plus, anyone  can use the escapism in Harry Potter books. Goblet of Fire has two good  lessons in it: cooperation with others, and fighting discrimination. It's a  great book!use the escapism in Harry Potter books.

But as in all the fine books that have  come before this series (The Lord of the Rings, The Dark Is Rising  sequence, etc.), the main character would be nothing without the help,  faithfulness and bravery of his friends.

Although I finished it within 11 hours, the book was no  less intriguing nor ensnarling for me than any of the other Harry Potter  fans scattered around (or should I say `crammed into') the world.  The book  clearly includes a large number of real-life references, ranging from  large-scale similarities such as political scandals and obstinate political  figures to book titles in the Hogwarts library: Where There's a Wand,  There's a Way; Men Who Love Dragons Too Much, and Powers You Never Knew You  Had and What to do With Them Now That You've Wised Up.  The new Defense  Against the Dark Arts teacher is my personal favorite so far.  Not as  ethical as Lupin, nor as bombastic and contrived as Lockhart, and different  again from the deceitful and two-faced (quite literally) Quirrell, he  follows the long line of DATDA teachers before him and lasts only a single  year.  (I wonder if the Daily Prophet simply assumes that it must run the  job offer again each summer! )  Some delightful new characters include the  prying, information inflating Rita Skeeter, the excitingly  different-than-expected Bill and Charlie Weasley, and the annoying little  owl that Ron received at the end of Harry Potter III, now named Pidwidgeon.  Old fans will be delighted to discover that Percy Weasley, now working for  the Ministry, hasn't changed a bit, and curious to see who the new  Gryffindor Quidditch captain is, now that Wood has gone (have we got a  surprise for you here! ).  Some new, more adult aspects appear, as Harry,  Ron and Hermoine must find dates for the Yule Ball and Ron becomes more  sensitive about his family's financial situation and  (just a bit) more  jealous of Harry, and Hermoine lets less and less of Malfoy's harsh words  bother her. Subtle strings of clues throughout the book entwine at the end,  culminating in an entrancing cliffhanger for readers.

Wow.  I really do think that it is the best of the bunch, primarily because it  tells a much more complex story that is still wrapped up in the end.  The  book is longer because there are more twists and major events than in the  previous volumes.  But Rowling brings all of the events together to a  logical and complete conclusion.  All questions are answered.  And, as she  stated in interviews as he goal, she has enabled Harry to make the  transition from boyhood to adulthood.  The next books are really going to  be something.<br />I do wonder how kids (and parents) are responding to the  text.  It gets dramatic (and spoilers will follow here).  It's always been  intense because Harry has always been an orphan whose parents were  murdered.  But this one is much more intense.  A fellow student dies.  Evil  becomes a much stronger and more recognizable force.  I am reminded of the  end of _The Empire Strikes Back_ because evil has risen and it appears that  it will triumph.  Sure, we know that the last book will end with Harry's  triumph, but the series has taken a dark turn.  No longer are Malfoy,  Crabbe, and Goyle merely Harry's school rivals. They are the sons of death  eaters.  Most likely, they want Harry dead and they just might try to kill  him in later books so that they will be seen as strong in their  &quot;Lord's&quot; eyes.<br />I don't mean for my comments on the book's  intensity to sound like a criticism in any way because I loved it.  The  book could be a great catalyst for discussion in junior high schools. But  I'm not sure what would happen if it's read in kindergartens as the earlier  books were. As a kid, this book would have scared me.  Though as an adult,  I love it.<br />The only, only, only thing I would have changed would have  been for Harry to have said something to Neville at the end, not to let him  know that Harry knows what happened to his parents.  But he should have  said goodbye or told Neville to send him an owl over the summer or just  made some tiny bit of connection with him.  This is certainly a minor  point,and I'm sure Neville will take on a greater role in later books.  I  certainly look at hischaracter differently now.goodbye or told Neville to send him an owl over the summer or just  made some tiny bit of connection with him.

J.K. Rowling doesn't talk down to us just because we are young.  She writes in the same spirit as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien (all the  best fantasy writers have intials for names).  Many people believe that it  is too serious too soon. The fact that there is death and other things  makes it more real.  I know in real life that isn't an evil wizard  Voldemort, but life doesn't rap up in a neat little package.  The book  addresses issues like bigotry and other social differencs that adults think  are either beyond our comprehension or that they are just scared of the  subjects themselves.  This book, despite the fact that it is thick, is very  interesting.  It holds its own even with the thinner books in the series.  Just because it is thick doesn't mean it's boring.  It is easy to read  because of the images that are created in your mind.  It fascinates us  because it is a world within ours that we know nothing about and wish we  could be apart of.  I'm not saying that it makes one want to join the  occult.  It doesn't.  It makes you want to read more fantasy (the greatest  type of book there is).  If someone does want to join the occult it is not  the book's fault.  It is that persons.  One of the better qualities of  the books is the fact that there are underlying messages.  The first book  says that love will always be with us, and the second says that our choices  makes us who we are more than our abilities.  The fourth says that it is  not what we are born, but what we grow up to be.  These messages are  important to children of all ages, considering the fact that many adults  have not learned those lessons themselves.	2000-08-12

I started reading the Harry Potter books because I heard on the news that certain Christian groups were giving them an unfaviorable review.  Out of  curiosity and being a Christian myself I felt it unfair to accept others  view of these books without knowing myself the context of them.  I  purchased all four of them and I have found them very enjoyable, very  intriguing, and in a way teach us how to conduct ourselves properly in very  confrontational situations.  I find them thoroughly delightful and hated  every time I had to put a book down.  I personally don't see anything wrong  with these books and recommend them for very pleasurable reading.

Harry Potter #4 is the best book so far. This was what I least expected. First there is a set tournament that the whole school watches. Not sneaking  down to meet Fluffy the three headed dog, or going up to the Shrieking  Shack to see Sirius Black. Not that it falls short of the other books, I'd  say it exceeds them by a lot. There is still all the ties that twist  together in the end, which I think J.K. Rowling has a talent for. This far  exceeds the Hobbit and the Redwall series.  Another reviewer said that  they could not concentrate on the book, and at times it was boring. In the  beginning the going is a little slow , but it all has to do with the ties.  If you don't want to read the beginning the book is not as good in the end.  The thing that makes this and the other books so popular is that people  can identify with them, that's why the appeal to the wide range of ages. We  have all had the big tests, The unfairness that we can't control,and the  risk taking thats in us too. The book's descriptions are quite good, you  feel like you're there with Harry battling with Profeser Quirrel, or eating  the squishy, and wormy gillyweed in Book 4.  However all the books are a  little sexist. There are only Two women professers, Trelawnry and  McGonagall. Trelawnry is shown to be basically a fake. McGonagall is  Super  strict and never lets  anything go by her. There are no woman characters  that are charming like professer Lupin. Hermione is also following the  McGonagall way, very strict. Although Hermione has been letting up on the  strictness through each book, its still there.  This is definately one  of the best books I'v read, and even though it costs a little more you  should get it.  Its more than seven hundred hundred pages of one of the  best book ever.	2000-08-10

It was recommended to me by my Honors English  teacher who is in her late 60's and was reading the book in class while we  were working.  So, I climbed aboard my 90 minute flight to Orlando and  settled down for some nice reading.  I read over 200 pages in those 90  minutes of one of the best books I have ever opened.  I quickly finished  that book and immediately went out and bought the other three, and finished  each of those in about 24 hours each.  The Goblet of Fire, however, has  been my favorite so far.  Harry's adventures in the TriWizard Tournament  kept my eyes glued to the pages.  I remember looking up and thinking,  &quot;Wow...I've just read 500 pages.&quot;  Basically what I'm trying to  say is that, this is not just a kid's book, it is a book for anyone who has  imagination, would like a good laugh, likes surprise endings, likes fantasy  books, or just someone who likes to read.  The Goblet of Fire is a book  that can be enjoyed by everyone.  So, go pick up this newest Harry Potter  book, or if you haven't read any of them, start at the beginning and work  your way up.  I guarantee, you will find yourself absorbed as I and others  have been in tales of Quidditch, Animagi, and of course, Harry Potter  himself.	2000-08-10

I am a 30-year old professional a bit young at heart (I happen to be in the toy industry.) I dived into the 4th book with great expectation after  the reading the first 3 and must admit to be somewhat disappointed.<br />The  1st half of the book is spent building up background info in arriving at  the conclusion of the last 150 pages.  Much of the humor found in books 1  to 3 is missing here, which is especially important when Rowling is trying  to drown the reader in the boring 3 to 4 hundred pages.<br />Another point I  also found to be very annoying is Harry and Ron's speech which began to  change gradually in book 3 and is now in full force in book 4.  Apparently,  Rowling wanted to make it sound &quot;colloquial&quot; and informal,  consequently, a lot of &quot;yeah,&quot; &quot;I dunno,&quot; etc.  I guess  you could say that the prose overall is actually a little sloppy at  times.<br />This book is heavy in terms of both weight and ambience, but light  in entertainment.	2000-08-09

Have you gotten doused by the Harry Potter tsunami yet?<br />First, for the comatose: The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series is the brainchild of British  author J.K. Rowling that has taken the world by storm and is credited with  saving childrens' literature, with four titles available- &quot;Harry  Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber  of Secrets,&quot; &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; and  the July-released &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;- and  three more on the way.<br />Rowling's now infamous protagonist is a young  wizard who survived an attack by evil Voldemort, a sorcerer so powerful  fellow magical folk dare not speak his name. Because Voldemort killed  Harry's parents but failed to murder Harry, the boy is a legend amongst  witches and wizards.<br />Unfortunately, Potter was raised by a disgusting  bunch of Muggle (nonmagic) relatives, and grew up without knowledge of his  abilities or status, until his identity was revealed to him in the first  book and he began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,  with friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.<br />With these books, Rowling  has created a world worthy of Roald Dahl (&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate  Factory&quot;) or John Bellairs (&quot;The House With a Clock In Its  Walls&quot;) and captured our own. With a record-shattering first printing  of more than 4 million for &quot;Goblet of Fire,&quot; it's safe to say-  this is Harry's world; we all just live in it.<br />The largest in the series  so far, &quot;Goblet&quot; clocks in at about 730 pages. But it's only that  long because so much happens. The fourth book takes Harry and company into  some uncharted territory. After a prologue foreshadowing the fallen  Voldemort's return into power, Harry and about 10,000 other magic folks  descend on the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. The  festivities are interrupted when Voldemort's symbol, the Dark Mark, appears  in the sky and Voldemort's minions, the Death Eaters, storm the campground.<br />When Harry returns to Hogwarts, he finds both a new Defense Against the  Dark Arts teacher, all-seeing black magic hunter Alastor &quot;Mad  Eye&quot; Moody and that Hogwarts will be the site of the annual Triwizard  Tournament, between the school and two others, the snooty Beauxbaton and  the chilly Durmstrang. And trouble, which comes when Harry is illegally  entered and declared the fourth contestant in the three-man race,  culminating in the death of a familiar face and a duel between Harry and  Voldemort.<br />Book Four maintains the wonder and magic that we've come to  expect from Rowling and Harry, although its epic size does mean some plots  could be shorter: Subplots involving a roving tabloid reporter with a  slander-ready quill and mysterious goings-on with some of the people behind  the World Cup scenes could be cut and not missed, and Voldemort goes on  quite a bit about his evil plans.<br />But these are small bumps in the  highway to Harry Potter heaven, with bright pots including Mad Eye; Harry's  crush on fellow Quidditch player Cho Chang; Hermione's creation of the  Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, or SPEW; a Ron and Hermione  bickerfest that may belie a romance, and touching correspondence between  Harry and his godfather, convicted murder Sirius Black.<br />Best of all, as  usual, are the antics of twins Fred and George Weasley, Ron's prankster  brothers who have embarked on a new venture inventing and selling gag  candies and other schemes. These two are always fun to watch, and Rowling  concludes &quot;Goblet&quot; by literally giving them the go-ahead spread  more mischief in the coming books.<br />Finally, a quick word ought to be said  about the price. 25 dollars is pretty pricey for a starving college  student- or anyone, really- who doesn't want to wait out the long library  lines or for paperback editions. It's too bad such a phenomenon can't be  more accessible to everybody.an't be  more accessible to everybody.	2000-08-08

An innocent, of course.&quot; This fourth installment in  the fantastic saga is doubtless darker than its those gone before it, yes,  but it suffers none: author JK Rowling embraces realism over escapism with  The Goblet of Fire, but her fiery wit - arguably what made the Potter books  such a success in the first place - remains steadfast. And with the darker  tone, there's no excuse for us adults to pass this one off as &quot;kids'  stuff&quot;.

It seems  like every where in this book whenever you turn around Harry is in danger  of something and that makes it really interesting. I think that having a  special tournament called the TriWizard Tournament gave the book a very  exciting twist because even though I love the Quidditch matches in the  other book it was a break from Quidditch and instead of Harry just trying  to win the Quidditch Cup he was riskign his life on this exciting  tournament that he's not even supposed to be in!

I felt the book should  have been condensed by at least a hundred pages because it dragged in  various places. And I was also disappointed at the dark turn the novel was  taking. It was perfectly all right that there was evil, and that someone  dies, but the overall feel was different from the first three books, as  though the evil was perhaps a bit glorified. This worries me so much that I  think I'll read the next book with my children aloud, just in case I need  to censor it or discuss with them the roles of good and evil.

The whole Harry Potter book #4 summed up in one word. Of course I can't just stop there, oh no. The magic, the imagination, the superb  writing, the countless hours of ignoring everything else except the  inevitability of nature and stuff like that but the moment you put that  book down, your head is swimming in thoughts of what will happen next, and  you want to get done whatever it is so fast to get back to enjoying  coutless dreaming. If you are waiting to read the reveiws BEFORE you read  the book, ignore all the reveiws that are putting the book down, because  you wont be able to. When i first heard that there was going to be a movie  out of the first book, my heart sank. There is so much to imagine that if  children go and see the movie, it'll be like they are being told what to  imagine, and that's what books are for, to imagine. And is watching the  television supposed to improve their imaginations? I think not. That's why  I was so disappionted. So, if you are an adult, READ THESE BOOKS! You will  thank yourself cause i bet you haven't imagined this much since you were  little. And if you know of any little ones (not too little, I reccomend  around 7 or 8 but it's your decision) then take them away to a world of  magic they will never forget.<br />(Still to come: Harry Potter 5 6 and 7.

First, I vowed to savor each chapter with the  kids and not read ahead (as I did with HP3, racing ahead to finish the book  in two evenings, and then re-reading with the kids). Second, we would  analyze all of the clues that Rowling plants throughout the story and  attempt to come closer to figuring out how JKR was going to surprise us at  the end.  As it turns out, I did not read ahead, and we did very well with  reading a chapter or two a night to prolong the pleasure of enjoying Book  Four as long as possible...until we reached Chapter 29. At this point, we  abandoned all self-discipline and raced through the remaining chapters in  two three-hour sessions! <br />We also failed miserably in figuring out the  surprise ending(s). It is amazing how Rowling places the clues so subtly;  we have already starting re-reading particular chapters to see how  different things seem now that we know the ending. <br />The book definitely  measures up to everything we were expecting! It is so enjoyable to share  the story with my kids -- we each feel that we know the characters so very  well now, and we laugh out loud at Hagrid's blast-ended skrewts, become  indignant as Malfoy insults Ron's mother, and feel pangs of fear as Harry  faces seemingly impossible odds. <br />I would definitely recommend this book  to anyone who wants to become absorbed in a superb story, especially if you  can share it with your kids!  The Goblet of Fire (and other Potter books)  are great examples to children of storytelling at its best (not to mention  the wonderful lessons of bravery, facing fear, loyalty, etc. etc.) It will  be a long wait for Book Five...but we are sure it will be worth the wait  once again.	2000-08-07

I had my  own ideas on who would die, and I (like many others) was way out.  Ooh  well...<br />Once again the new characters where just incredible, and the  existing characters held their own and got more impressive.  Mad Eye Moody  is probably the best character yet to show up and he was just phenominal...  I have to say the chapter when harry takes a bath and gets stuck in the  stairs is with out doubt the best chapter from any of the four books.<br />Now we have to look forward and ask questions about book 5...  the  ending of the Goblet of Fire leaves so many doors open, but we can rest  assured that we will find more surprises, thrills and spills.<br />As a side  not, on a recent trip to England I picked up the English release and was  disappointed about how poorly it was presented, could you imagine Harry  Potter without Mary Grandpre !	2000-08-07

I read the first 3 in less than a  week - and was totaly enthralled.  When it came time for book 4 - I  devoured it it two days.  As a high school teacher - I am convinced that  anything that will get students to read is a good thing.  This goes way  beyond that.  What Harry and his friends do is give kids a sence of what  they can  accomplish on their own. When it comes right down to it, Harry,  Ron and company do more by thinking out a problem than by magicially making  it dissappear.  All in all - a wonderful series of books - and I can't wait  for #5!	2000-08-07

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has made me laugh, cry, quiver in fear, and most of all,  think. With exceptional detail, i actually thought i was in the book's  world of Wizards, Witches and Elves. The book starts out when Harry is at  the Dursley's house. Suprisingly, he gets a letter from Ron saying that  Ron's Father got tickets to the Quidditch World cup and wondering if Harry  would like to come. Harry of course excepts, and after a comical scene in  the Dursley's chimney (yes, the Weasleys used Floo Powder)they're off. I  would recommend this to everybody, but especially to previous Harry Potter  fans. The only downside to the book is that it seems to slightly drag on  (after all, it does have about 750 pages) with details, but basically, it  is a GREAT book.	2000-08-07

What on earth will we do  when Harry graduates from Hogwarts?  Rowling is just so skilled... she has  Hermione nobly fighting 'elf' discrimination, and Harry thrust into a magic  school (one from France, and another from the &quot;northern  countries&quot;) competition (the Triwizard Tournament) in which a  schoolmate actually dies for Harry!  We even have the beginnings of a  schoolboy crush for Harry (and his first 'prom-like' experience).  The book  begins with the International Quiddich Cup event (the World Cup for  Wizards) where Ron and the Weasleys take Harry and begin the years'  adventures, and ends in another of Rowling's amazing and absolutely  terrifying climax where Harry's pure goodness is enough to defeat the very  evilness of the Lord Valdemort who is growing stronger and a greater danger  with each novel.  The exquisite writing by Rowling is so subtle that there  is absolutely nothing to make any reader believe that any of this is not  real.

It is wonderful to know that a particular series just never seems to become boring. Although I am a Harry Potter fan, I was a bit doubtful as to  whether or not &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; would live  up to its expectations. I was not at all dissapointed (well, except when I  reached the end), and I devoured all seven hundred and thirty-some pages in  one huge gulp! The novel opens with a spooky scene taking place at the old  Riddle House. This turns out to be a nightmare, so intense that Harry  awakes with a searing pain in his lightning-bolt-shaped scar. We find out  later that Harry's summer isn't going too well, but that changes as he is  invited to see the Quidditch World Cup with his friends. However, the game  ends and the happy atmosphere vanishes as a group of Death Eaters (Lord  Voldemort's loyal supporters) are sighted. The Dark Mark (the symbol of  death) is then shot into the sky by a mysterious supporter of Voldemort's.  The story continues as Harry and his pals return to Hogwarts School for  their fourth year. We learn that instead of the usual Quidditch matches,  the famous Triwizard Tournament will take place at Hogwarts this year.  Three schools will be competing against each other, and one lucky student  is selected from each school (Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang) to  compete. Will Harry be chosen as one of the champions? The tournament  involves three difficult tasks that all of the contenders must complete,  and each one is full of adventure! We are also introduced to some new  characters, among them Rita Skeeter (a nosy news reporter) and Barty Crouch  (a very strict man working for the Ministy of Magic). Readers are also  presented with some puzzling questions. Could Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot;  Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, be more than the  kindly, wise man that he appears to be? Could Lord Voldemort possibly  return to power? As always, J.K. Rowling manages to concoct an exciting  answer to these questions. Ms.Rowling's interesting humor and wit is shown  in this story as well. She includes jokes and puns in this book that both  children and adults will understand. And, as you may have heard,  &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is a lot darker than the other Potter books.  There will be death, there will be blood. I do not suggest that you read  the last five or so chapters in the dark. Anyway, the book has a fantastic  ending, but it does not satisfy the reader. It leaves them hanging, waiting  for the next Potter novel!

Many times I lifted my eyes from the book and wondered, &quot;Does  she REALLY need to go through with all these sub-plots?&quot; Somehow, I  doubt it. (also the joke involving a planet raises the eyebrow. Com'on, was  it really necessary? Surely one can write a decent, even brilliant, book  without adding tasteless jokes) Still, at the end of the book, one does  feel that she has successfully enlarged the plot, introducing many  intriguing possibilities. Also there is a sense of an impending show-down  between the forces of Good and Evil. Though Snape is the character I would  like to hate the most, he's probably the only one in the book who refuses  to be categorised as the Good Guy or the Nasty Guy. The book just barely  reaches expectations... okay, the faithful servant of Voldemort is pretty  hard to guess, but the one who would die was pretty obvious. And  dissapointing. MAJOR character? Sez who?  I don't dare say more for fear of  revealing too much, but I was prepared to 'sacrifice' bigger, more  well-developed characters to feel the grief that reviews had been preparing  me for. The ending when they were asked to remember _____ (the one who  died) was pretty corny, I thought. Let's not stoop to facetiousness. One  last question. There was a superb opportunity in the book to talk about  slavery, but the book glosses over it. Apparently there are creatures who  love being slaves. This might be a really original theme in the history of  literature. It wasn't amusing nor did it contribute much to the general  plot, so why this approach?	2000-08-04

Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.  This is unmerited, because the works of Tolkien  and Lewis go far beyond the level of story - they impart great truths about  human nature and theology on a deeper level.  Rowling's novels do not have  such a deeper level, but are simply books which entertain.<br />That is not to  say that Rowling's novels are not good.  They clearly are.  The incredible  sales record of the Harry Potter series tells its own story of success.   <br />As a fantasy story-teller about the world of magic, Rowling is  undeniably skilled.  Many of Rowling's concepts are strongly reminiscent of  the brilliant children's fantasy fiction by Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl, and  she likely has been influenced by their work.<br />However, Rowling clearly  has a style of her own, and in this fourth book of the Harry Potter series,  has confirmed her reputation as a story-teller for children.  This novel  has all the ingredients of a good children's novel - suspense, imagination,  and excitement.  <br />Most importantly, children can identify with its  characters.  Although Rowling describes a fantasy world that exists only in  her imagination and the reader's, it is clear that this fantasy world is  largely a mirror image of our own 20th century Western world.  What makes  this series so successful, is that people recognize themselves in the novel  - their school life (Hogwarts), their human rights ideology (Hermione's  fight for the elves), their worship of team sports (the quiddich world cup)  and individual sports (the tri-wizard contest), their political world  (ministry of magic), their media (interviews with the Daily Prophet), their  concern with health and beauty, their relationships between guys and girls,  and their love of feasting and food (The Yule Ball). <br />Although Harry  Potter and the Goblet of Fire is about a fantasy world, ultimately it is  about ourselves.  And that is why we love it.  Highly recommended!	2000-08-04

Ms. Rowling must be related to Albert Einstein!  The fourth installment of the Harry Potter series has been anticipated for for about eight months.  And it has lived up to all the hype.  This year, the famous wizard Harry  Potter, wants to be a normal wizard.  He wants to go to the quidditch cup  with his friends.  And he does.  I think this is the most vividly described  part of the whole book.  The tents of the wizards can take you into a state  of utter amazement.  He want to know about the event involving two rival  schools that will take place at Hogwarts.  And he does.  It is the  triwizard competition.  Three champions over seventeen will be picked to  complete three tasks.  But Harry is picked as the fourth champion.  He  wants to be a normal wizard.  But he isn't.  And it could be deadly.  Long  before the fourth installment Ms. Rowling warned us that this episode would  be darker.  It does not encourage children to join the occult and such  strange nonsense people have cooked up.  It is a work of FICTION and read  for enjoyment.  And I enjoyed it immensly and know anybody else will too.  If there is ever a proposal for an eighth wonder of the world, this series  will be on the list of choices.  This is the book that has gotten children  to read 734 pages of utter magic over the summer.  Think it over.	2000-08-02

Nothing less. Nothing more.<br />Before you even consider buying this book  (presuming you haven't already), you simply MUST read Prisoner of Azkaban,  Book 3 before you dive in to Book 4's deepter waters. Reading Book 4 before  3 would take all the fun out of Book 3, as Rowling uses Book 3 as the  stepping-stone to Goblet of Fire.<br />The plot isn't complicated - it's  rather simple actually. Voldemort rises to power again and his most  faithful servant is at Hogwarts. Simple enough. Much of the pleasure of  reading this book lies in the surprising characters, creatures and most of  all - events. If the idea of fighting a fire-breathing dragon and duelling  with Voldemort doesn't appeal to you, you'll probably be sorely  disappointed. The Triwizard Tournament was awesome, so was the ending. The  most suspenseful part of the book is the First Task. Otherwise it isn't  even remotely scary. Parents who think a little gore is going to cause  their children severe brain damage should check to see what they're  watching on TV these days...<br />And for heaven's sake, I'm sick and tired of  people saying (or at least insinuating) that Rowling CREATED the fantasy  genre. Open your eyes, they're tons of fantasy books out there just like  Harry Potter - with better plots. Dianna Wynne Jones writes superb books.  So does J.R. Tolkien. C.S. Lewis's tales aren't for me, I never really  liked them.  However, the Potter series does a better job of creating a  fantasy world with various characters you can relate to - especially Harry.  Poke around, you'll find some fantasy to keep you alive till Harry Potter  5.<br />Spanning 37 chapters, Goblet of Fire is by no means short, though with  smaller text it could have been shrunk to about 350 pages. I read the  British version with 636 pages and it's different from the American, since  I didn't notice the word 'damn' even once. And as for that... parents ought  to grow up! So what if your child reads a book with the word 'damn' in it?  If he/she's over 11, it doesn't matter one bit. 'Damn' is by no means an  explicit word - it just isn't suitable to the youngest of readers. Anyone  over 10 should be using the word 'damn' every now or then. It's not going  to hurt if they see it in a book. And in that case, they shouldn't be  reading this book. All in all, this is a must for anyone even slightly  interested in reading. Only the most hardcore fantasy readers will not  enjoy this book, dismissing it as 'under 12' (speaking of which, I'm now  13).'t notice the word 'damn' even once.

How  can people say these books are evil, of all things! It's a STORY, people, a  STORY! A story that gets both adults and kids more than interested. Harry  Potter #4 is as good, if not better, than the rest.  The book begins with  Harry going to the Quidditch ( correct spelling?) World Cup( after a  somewhat easy struggle with the Durselys). Strange things happen there,  including an appearrance of Voldemort's special signal. This confirms  Harry's fear that Voldemort is getting powerful, an idea he gets from a  strange and quite realistic dream. Harry Potter learns a very exciting,  although disapointing, tidbit when he arrives at Hogwarts School. A  tournament is to be held against two other magic schools, and only anyone  seventeen and older can compete. Many things happen as Harry struggles  through his fourth year at Hogwarts, good and very bad. I like the little  details, like Rita Skeeter's articles, Cho Chang, and Harry seeing memories  of Dumbledore. And readers are definitly in for a surprise at the very last  few chapters. I don't want to ruin that surprise. The plot of Harry Potter  and the Goblet of Fire is amazingly well contrtructed and moves along very  fast.  There is no one I wouldn't reccomend this book to.

Every day of the wait between the third part and the recent one was worth it. Although, this one is much bigger, and much more dark than any of the previous ones, I loved almost  every bit of it. Unlike the other three, this time I was completely  clueless, until the very end as to who the collaborator of the dark lord  was. The other three were also extremely suspenseful, and quite surprising  at the end, I happened to guess either correctly or in the ball park.) The  death and the encounter of Voldemort with the protagonist has made the  story more edgy, more suspenseful, and the encounter of Harry with his  victimized parents due to reverse spell, made it a very subtle and poignant  moment. The imagery, the story telling, innovatively imaginative ideas of  portkey, WWN, and gillyweed, and more made the whole plot even more  interesting, and full of surprises.<br />Also the internationalization of the  wizarding world, the subtle but clear insinuations to the over enthusiatic  press in our regular world  through the character of Rita Skeeter, rendered  an extra dimension to this series.<br />All in all, we all know that this book  is making history in the publishing world. I must say that with the turn of  events at the end of this current volume, the progression will be even more  interesting, vivid, and the eternal struggle between good and evil will be  played out in a more direct manner.<br />Also a point to note, this series,  has another underlying lesson, &quot;different does not mean evil, there  are goods and evils in types and kinds&quot;.<br />Again congratulations to  the author for keeping it up to her previous successes.	2000-07-31

I have read all of the Harry Potter books and I simply loved number four. I have also never been stopped by so many  strangers on the street to be asked about a book. It seems as tho everyone  wanted to know how the book was and if I had read the previous three. I  told everyone that still has an inner child to run out and buy this book  (as well as the first three).<br />JK Rowling seems to be getting better with  age and experience as does Harry. She has really expanded her wings in this  installment of the Harry Potter series.<br />While the book begins exactly  the same as the past three books - with Harry stuck at the Dursley's for  the summer and his friends the Weasley's must rescue him so that he can go  to the Quidditch world cup finals.<br />But this is where the similarities  stop and the real imagination begins. Without saying too much - this novel  is (obviously) longer than the previous three and while most people were  stunned at the start of the book - I think I can safely say no one wanted  it to end. I would have been happy with another hundred pages.<br />Things  turn for Harry in number four - as he reaches adolescences he has to deal  with all the ups and downs it brings with it, a first crush and a painful  loss as well as taunting and trying to discover who he really is.<br />This  book is once again a triumph for readers of all ages.

It has an excellent sense of  mystery and keeps you guessing about several issues all at once. This time  Harry's problems come to him, instead of his trouble making habits coming  out. Don't get me wrong he's as daring as ever, but he's forced into  situations by someone elses doings. The end of the book left me with so  many unanswered questions. I'm thirsting for more and I can't wait until  the 5th year.	2000-07-31

Harry Potter is a British boy and the books are wonderfully UK! We (my family) love all 4 and my younger kids sit enthralled as I read the latest one out. I love doing the voices  for Malfoy and Hagrid and Aunt Petunia and the rest. These books are so  wonderfully inventive and yet reflect life too. Just read the chapters  where Ron and Harry are trying to arrange dates for the Yule Ball - JK gets  the adolescent thing so exactly right - these are my favourite  chapters.Full marks to Hermione!  And full marks to JK Rowling for superb  writing and great suspense and fun.	2000-07-31

I did enjoy Harry's new adventures in his fourth year at Hogwarts.  However, this book alone would not persuade a doubtful child or parent that the Harry Potter series  is worth merit.  For one reason the size is very intimidating.  I can not  see myself handing over a seven-hundred and thirty-four page book to a  child to get them interested in reading.  They would feel overwhelmed and  give up after the first two chapters, possibly from fatigue at just  carrying the book around.  (The first book in the Harry Potter series would  be better suited to get a child interested in reading)  Second, the  innocence of the characters is severely diminished.  One might argue that  they're getting older, but it just came as a big surprise to me.  One such  example is when Ron mentions the planet Uranus (and it's double meaning) in  relation to a fellow student.  I found this inappropriate for adolescent  humor.  Third, a house-elf in the  story drowns her sorrow in a substance  that works similar to alcohol.  This presents an all too often seen message  for depressed adolescents to turn to drugs to solve their problems.  There  goes all of DARE's hard work!  The house-elf never deals with her sorrow  and ends her part in the book sobbing uncontrollably.  While Hogwarts and  the whole magical world has always been filled with witches and wizards,  their themes and attributes seem more pronounced in this book.  More  attention is given to pointed hats and the standard &quot;witch and  wizard&quot; attributes than in previous books.  The ending scene with  Voldemort is very disturbing and seems to have been written for critics to  focus on.  Never before has a Potter book seemed close to Satanic rituals  or cult-like followings.  This is not true of the fourth book.  I really  enjoyed the development of Hermione's character.  She is quickly becoming  my favorite, next to Harry, that is!  This critic did not let the above  stop her from thoroughly enjoying the book, or waiting on bated breath for  the next.  (Especially the way it ended).  Regardless, I can not see myself  handing it over to an innocent adolescent without stopping to discuss with  them during key points in the book.op her from thoroughly enjoying the book, or waiting on bated breath for  the next.

The NY Times should be ashamed at making a new section for  children's books so 'adult' books can be shown in the top 10.  With all  respect to Daniel Steel, the Potter books are a much better read for any  adult.  They convey the classical literary ideals of good vs. evil, the  search for truth and pure unadulterated fun.

As I had read the first three books (one a day) and  enjoyed them tremendously, I was really frustrated not being able to get my  hands on the fourth book soon enough. It was worth the wait. Clearly with  its 750+ pages, this was not a book to be read in one day (more like two  and a half). Moreover, knowing that there was no fifth book available, I  had to savor it. Having grown up imagining myself a witch, I enjoyed the  Harry Potter books greatly. I must admit after the first three books I  wished the women/young girl characters were a little more mischievous, and  fun. The fourth book definitely goes farther along in that direction.

I've read all the Harry Potter books and I loved number four. I brought the book with where ever I went and I have never  been stopped by so many strangers on the street to be asked about a book.  It seems as tho everyone wanted to know how the book was and if I had read  the previous three. I told everyone that still has an inner child to run  out and buy this book (as well as the first three).<br />  JK Rowling  seems to be getting better with age and experience as does Harry. She has  really spread her wings in this installment of the Harry Potter series.<br />  While the book begins exactly the same as the past three books - with Harry  stuck at the Dursley's for the summer and his friends the Weasley's must  rescue him so that he can go to the Quidditch world cup finals - readers  will be happily pleased with the rest of the book.<br />  But this is  where the similarities stop and the real imagination begins. Without saying  too much - this novel is (obviously) longer than the previous three and  while most people were stunned at the start of the book - I think I can  safely say no one wanted it to end. I would have been happy with another  hundred pages. Things turn for Harry in number four - as he reaches  adolescences he has to deal with all the ups and downs it brings with it, a  first crush and a painful loss as well as taunting and trying to discover  who he really is.<br />This once again a triumph for readers of all ages. So  sit down and enjoy the ride.	2000-07-31

This was a very good book with a very colorful cast of chacters.  Dudley is on a diet, the Quidditch World Cup is this year, and someone is coming back.  It all begins when Harry  recives a letter from Ron inviting him to the World Cup match.  He glady  excepts and the Dursleys happily let him go, glad to have him gone early.  Harry happiliy looks forward to the day when he will leave, but when it  comes, the Weasley's make a large mistake.  They decide to arrive by Floo  powder!  The fireplace is boarded up, so Mr. Weasley blasts it appart.  All summer Fred and George have ben working on a secret company.  They  decide to try there experiments on Dudley and results are hilarious!  They all return to the Burrow, and Harry finally meets Bill and Charlie.  Percy's working for the Ministery and is more stuck up than ever.  His  boss, Mr. Crouch, who is a small charcter in the beginning, grows and  becomes very important in the end.  The match is very exciting, and  Harry buys Hermione and Ron special binoculars for the match.  Everyone is  infatuated with one of the seekers, who also becomes a very important  person in the story, (espically with Hermione, to Ron's surprise.)  Afterwards, an emergency takes place and Harry, Ron and Hermione all flee  into the woods.  Harry misplaces his wand, and becomes very worried.  After  a mark in the sky is conjured, and Harry's wand is found near the edge of  the wood clutched in the hands of a house-elf named Winky, he suspected.  But after a few minutes of yelling, his name is cleared and Winky is the  top suspect.  Winky turns out to be Mr. Crouch's house-elf and on the  act of dishonor is sacked.  She begs forgiveness but is forgotton, and she  gets a job at Hogwarts.  When everyone returns to the school, an  anouncement is made that there will be no Quidditch this year, due to a  differnt activity.  Everyone wants to enter, but there's an age limit.  Three older students get in, but somehow, Harry gets in too.  This book  is packed with adventure, but Rowling writes diffrently this time, giving  the charcters time to change, grow,and mature.

You will find it much more enjoyable to read them in order.  If you have not read any of them, and if you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings,  the Chronicles of Narnia, or similar series, this will be a treat for you.  Reading them in order will only delay your reading of Goblet of Fire by a  week or so: they go fast!  J. K. Rowling's novels keep getting better.  The  first one (Sorcerer's Stone) was quite good, and the second (Chamber) had a  hard time equalling it, but the third one (Azkaban) was clearly superior to  its predecessors.  In some ways it's better than number four (Goblet of  Fire).  Goblet is perhaps a bit too long, but the quality of writing is  very high.  It is easy to see why kids read these books over and over.  Many books are not worth re-reading, but these stories reward the repeat  reader.  I can't wait to get the UK editions to see what changes were made  for the American market.  That will help pass the time while waiting for  number 5!	2000-07-30

The first 150 pages or so seem a bit slow, compared to the beginnings of the prior volumes in the series, but persist, good reader! After that, the story quickly picks up, and escalates to a dizzying tale of suspense by the end, at which point the seeming slowness of the first portion is explained. Quite masterfully done, Book IV also shows the beginning of Harry's growth into adulthood, with its responsibilities and its heartaches, including one grim lesson: Sometimes the good guy has to content himself with getting out alive instead of winning. I devoured this book in one sitting (about 7 hours), and am now somewhat disgruntled that it will be another year before I can continue with this intriguing series.

I am a 43 year old mother of an 8 year old boy, and we LOVE Harry Potter.  We got the first book at Christmas, and as soon as it was finished, we ordered the second.  Half-way through the second, we ordered the third  book.  And, as soon as it was possible, we pre-ordered the then untitled  book 4.  And each time, we have not been disappointed. My son can, and  does, read quite well on his own, but Harry Potter brings us back together,  snuggled on the couch, while I read aloud, doing all the voices.  It is a  lot of fun, especially as Ms. Rowling writes with such detail that the  words just seem to read themselves, and the voices take shape all on their  own. This fourth book is much more intense, and darker than the first  three, and I kept pausing during some of the scenes, to be sure my son  wasn't too frightened.  He would just say, &quot;I'm fine...keep  reading! &quot;  And I would. The fact that Harry and his friends are  growing up is wonderful, however, I hope Ms. Rowling doesn't lose to many  of her younger fans by making them grow too fast.  The intesity, hormonally  and well as wizardly, could be much worse for the younger kids, and that  would be too bad. But, I wouldn't trade Harry Potter for anything, as it  brought my son &amp; I back together on the couch over a good book. LONG  LIVE HARRY POTTER!	2000-07-30

The first book was an amazing new trend that popped up out of nowhere and surprised us all. It carried us into the whole world of Harry Potter. The second book was better, and longer(does a happy dance). The plot thickened and you couldnt wait for more. The third book was just soo amazing that I didn't think she could keep it up. The new characters, I mean, who couldn't love dearest Padfoot and Moony. (I await their, or at least Moony as Padfoot is in the fourth book, with little patience.)  Then, I read the fourth book. O MY GOD. The way it runs, it's like it wasn't written, rather as if it has actually occured. As different events roll by, I found myself jumping up and down, screaming with delight and terror, laughing hysterically and more. By the time the last book comes out, I'll be a junior(probably, if she publishes a book a year). But you know what? I know that I'll still be reading about the adventures of dear Harry Potter, and loving it.<br />A small PS- Many have compared Rowling's work to that of Tolkien.  I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings many years ago, and adored that as well.  There is little reason to say which is better, as they are both fantastic works.  Neither are high literature, but neither should be disregarded by any means either.	2000-07-30

I should  have known all along that the book would be as entertaining and magical as  the first three.  Harry starts to do a lot of growing up in this book.  I  wish the series had come out when I was at a similar age as Harry, because  I think that Ms. Rowling has a wonderful knack at portraying the trials of  early adolescence and classmate rivalry.  But the most important point is  that one doesn't have to be a young adult to love the books. I find myself  calling mean people 'muggles'in place of less nice phrases, and wishing  that I could use Summoning Charms when I am too lazy to get off the couch  to get a ringing phone.

The latest installment of the adventures of the boy-wizard at Hogwarts will not disappoint the legions of Potter fans.    All of Rowling's imaginative and intelligent school kids are back and fill the book's 700+  pages with more of the rapid paced twisty-turny plot that is the hallmark  of this series.    While no spoilers here, some surprises await the reader  as among other things, Harry discovers girls.   The situation of course is  handled deftly with great wit and humor as we expect from the author.    Conversely, this one is a tad darker in tone than the previous three and a  death and its effects on those who survive is very realistically portrayed;  frankly these only add to the vivid realism to be found throughout these  magical fantasies.    After the story's climax, the explanations go on a  bit too long before the book actually ends, but this a minor criticism and  the ending is well worth the wait.   Any author who can get kids to read a  700-page tome certainly has this librarian's respect and admiration.  The  whole series is highly recommended for everyone who enjoys a rousingly  grand read.	2000-07-30

As soon as I finished I quickly ordered the  1st, 3rd and 4th books. I could not even fall asleep, when I didn't finish  a book because I was to eager to wake up in the morning and start again.  Ever since I five years old I always loved books about magic and creatures.  These books have all of that. From the time Harry is introduced to the time  he discovers he is a wizard, to the time he discovers that his evil  nemisis, who killed Harry's parents is getting his power back, ALL of it is  just great.

As a 15 year old reader, this book seems to me just the type of book our society would embrace.  It resembles an above average action movie- just sit down, relax, and put your brain on autopilot, and pretty soon, you're  done, and you've achieved a superficial satisfaction with predictable  plots, boring, uncomplicated characters, and enough gizmos and special  effects, however predictable, to make you feel that the book achieved some  kind of inventiveness.  Endearing characters!  How?  To be endearing,  characters must have flaws- something to sympathize with!  Do these  characters have flaws, or can they even be described using more than 2  different adjectives each?  The good characters are good, kind, and  selfless.  Any mistake is either not their fault or easily forgiven- few  consequences.  The bad characters are &quot;bad to the bone&quot;- be it  the family- (believable?  Or just another bland twist on the evil  stepsisters/stepmother/Roald Dahl-esque family in 'Matilda' premise?) - or  the bully, Malfroy.  Can't he possess any endearing traits?  Most bullies  possess some redeeming qualities, or at least are a victim in some way  themselves.  The types of magic used in these stories are also  unremarkable.  Spells, enchanted objects, incantations...how mundane.  And  used to excess.  Cheep thrills and the long = better mentality add up to  the Harry Potter mania.  I wouldn't be so scathingly negative if it  weren't for the Harry Potter series' popularity.  They are *somewhat*  entertaining, but meanwhile, people are raving that these are THE greatest  books ever, or at least close.  People think that no other children's  fantasy comes close.  That is a monsterous misconseption!  When a younger  reader, I read tons of children's fantasy.  True, proven, innovative  classics do exist.  Just look at Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The  Hobbit', Peter Beagle's 'The Lost Unicorn', 'The Phantom Tollbooth', C. S.  Lewis' 'The Chronicals of Narnia', wonderfully funny Roald Dahl, Susan  Cooper's 'The Dark is Rising' sequence, Lloyd Alexander's 'The Prydan  Chronicles', John Bellairs' fun, darkish fantasy/mysteries, Phillip  Pullman's still unfolding, greatly promising 'His Dark Materials' series,  Diana Wynne Jones' marvelously twisted, ingenious, funny books, Madeline  L'Engle's fabulous 'A Wrinkle in Time' (and sequels)- among thousands of  other titles.  All of the above are wonderful, innovative, deceptively  simple (in some cases), and unforgettably unique books all worthy of  multiple re-readings.  To Harry Potter, like a mediocre action movie, I  will only give one screening.  The question is not whether the above books  have a plethora of merits, but whether you will read some and wade into  deeper waters than lightly enjoyable Harry Potter books.funny Roald Dahl, Susan  Cooper's 'The Dark is Rising' sequence, Lloyd Alexander's 'The Prydan  Chronicles', John Bellairs' fun, darkish fantasy/mysteries, Phillip  Pullman's still unfolding, greatly promising 'His Dark Materials' series,  Diana Wynne Jones' marvelously twisted, ingenious, funny books, Madeline  L'Engle's fabulous 'A Wrinkle in Time' (and sequels)- among thousands of  other titles.

I was there for the new release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; and I was determined to get my hands on a copy.   At the age of 18, I looked very out of place standing amongst the 7 and 8  year olds and their parents, but my sister, 15, and I are avid Harry Potter  fans.  We ran home, each clutching our VERY own copy of the book, and read  until we both fell asleep at 3 a.m.  <br />This book is my favorite of the  first four.  It is emotional, well written, exciting, and a non-stop read.   I read the entire book from start to finish in 27 hours, and that included  one 4-hour night of sleep and being forced to tape X-Files.  <br />It does not  matter what age you are, these books are not exclusively for children.

You feel, along with Harry, his joy, frustration,  fear and sorrow throughout the entire book.  Things are explained from  previous years and new information is revealed.  The ending leaves  questions to be answered in the last three books.  This book definately  made me THINK during the reading and when I finished it.  <br />I cannot wait  for book five and I will GUARANTEE you that I will stand outside of ANY  bookstore at ANY hour for another dose of Harry Potter.	2000-07-29

A sub-plot involving house-elves never really generated steam. The political correctness of it felt a bit out of place.

I just could not  put the book down while I was reading it (When I first got hold of the much  waited book 4, I was reading it into the wee hours of morning). I think why  I enjoyed the book so much is because by this time, the characters have  grown on you.  They're not just some made-up heroes anymore, they are your  friends, and somehow, you sort of feel what they're going through.  Of  course, amid the familiar settings and personalities, Rowling adroitly  introduces new people, twists, and secrets.  But don't fret, the same wry  humor is very much still there.

Many characters return  from the previous books, including Moaning Myrtle and Dobby, who were  mysteriously absent from Book 3. As any Harry Potter fan would expect, you  get treated to a shocking &quot;revelation&quot; near the end that explains  all the mysteries.<br />I have a tiny bit of negative points to express. First  of all, it is very tiring to hear about what happened in the past 3 books.  The first hundred pages are full of stuff like this so that people who  haven't read the previous books can catch up. You absolutely must have read  the past 3 books before reading this one, I warn you now. The length of the  book is a good point. The goodness lasts longer and it feels truely epic.  The previous 3 books now seem small in comparison. The climax of the book  when Harry meets with You-Know-Who himself is truely exciting and erases  any negative feelings you may have had before.<br />In my opinion, the Goblet  of Fire is the second best book of the series (behind the Prisoner of  Azkaban). It's an absolute must-read for every human on earth. It's the  &quot;Star Wars&quot; of books, and no one whould miss out.	2000-07-29

Back at hogwarts ( a school for young witches and wizards) we get  a new defense agianst the black arts teacher, &quot;madeye&quot; moody,  also there is a new thig going on at hogwarts it is called a Triwizard  Tournament!

This book is excellent and I'm glad thebook was so long, because it was wonderful knowing that there wasstill a way to go before I was finished. Rowling is at her descriptivebest. She introduces us to other wizarding schools, makes us think about the rights of house-elves who seem to be happy with no rights whatsoever, and the first ball at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione are going through the inevitable adolescent blues. Harry has a crush Cho who likes Cedric, Ron is jealous of Harry as he feels Harry always is in the limelight while he has to be content being only Harry's friend and Hermione is the apple of a famous Quidditch plyer's eye. We wonder whether Ron and Hermione will ever date each other. At the same time, Voldemort is becoming more powerful....<br />Rowling's style has dicreetly become more mature to suit the the age of the characters of her book. This book has a more universal appeal and older children will definitely read it.<br />I can't wait for the next book.	2000-07-29

There  are some truly terrifying parts of the book (even to an adult like me) and  some situations that seem to me to be inappropriate for children under 10  or so.  My recommendation to parents would be to read ahead of your child  so that you can prepare them for some of the more difficult and scary  parts.  You know your child and know what they can and cannot handle as far  as death and terror go, but be cautious of just reading to a small child.  As a child, this book would have caused me nightmares.

I am also an elementary teacher and  thought it would be a good idea to know what many children are interested  in.  I loved the story and it is a great series of books to keep the  children's interest.  The one thing that would keep me from allowing the  books in my classroom or encouraging my daughter to read them is the many  &quot;bad words&quot; that are thrown in.  Why would a children's author,  that has this wonderful idea for literature, think that she has to include  these words that many of us do not use or want our children to hear or use?  I could see no reason to include these unnecessary words, and therefore  would not encourage any child to read the books. I realize the majority of  families use this kind of language in their homes, but I think we should be  ashamed of ourselves for encouraging bad things when our children are  involved.  (I have marked through all the &quot;bad words&quot; as I was  reading and suggest that all parents at least do this before handing the  books over to their children.)	2000-07-27

I have read the  first book 12 times the second one 6 times and the third book 7 times so i  guess u could call me a harry potter fanatic.  Everything i do is about  harry potter.  I think about him i talk about him and i dream about him.  So i reccomend this book to any of the few people who havent read it  already.	2000-07-27

I just finished completing by far the best novel I've ever read. J.K. Rowling has simply outdone herself.<br />Just two short weeks ago, I decided that I had to discover what this &quot;Harry Potter&quot; craze was all  about. Bombarded from every direction (either by the media or friends  telling me that the books &quot;are amazing&quot;), I just had to find out.  After reading the first book, the Sorceror's Stone, I was a Potter fanatic.  I quickly finished books 2 and 3 and got 4 about a week ago.<br />Book 4  opens unlike any of the other books, which was a welcome treat. Book four,  in a nutshell, is quite possibly destined to be a classic. It is comparable  to any film, record, painting, photograph, you name it. It is a work of  art. Rowling strands multiple plotlines and her own magical creations  together to create a wonderful confection that could not simply be referred  to as a &quot;children's book&quot; (actually that would be an insult).  Yes, this book is filled with things that children will love--unforgettable  characters, lots of magic, and a great story. However, adults will  appreciate all of these things as well and will get an extra treat: they  will also be able to appreciate the sly humor, the intense imagery, and the  many allusions to history and pop culture that children may not  understand.<br />I recommend, that before you buy this book READ ALL OF THE  OTHERS. Though you can theoretically just pick up book four and start  reading (Rowling gives a wealth of backstory), you would really be doing  yourself an injustice. There is so much that happened before this story;  don't read the other three and you will miss out on the emotional jolts  that this book gives numerous times. And another warning: don't read this  book unless you are fully aware that you will be physically, mentally, and  socially attached to it until you finish!	2000-07-27

Maybe because I'm 14 means that reading children's books isn't socially acceptable. Well, tough. As a loyal Harry reader, I was a tad worried that maybe this bookwouldn't live up to the standards of the past  3.<br />WRONG! In Book 4, the excitement never stops as JK Rowling goes for an  even twistier plot than &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. Harry is chosen to  participate in a Triwizard Tournament with young socerers from Durmtrang  and Beauxbatons, other magical schools. The tasks can be deadly, the  competition fierce, and of course, being Harry Potter means that simply  living is reason to be nervous...Nothing is quite what is seems when you  reach the action packed conclusion, which, unlike past Harry books, leaves  ends hanging for the next book in the series.<br />Naturally, all your  favorite characters are back:Ron, Hermione, the Weasely twins, Hagrid,  Dumbledore(obviously), Snape, and, happily, Sirius Black...But there are  plenty of new faces, like &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody, the new Dark Arts  teacher who gives new definition to the word paranoid.

More people die, Harry experiences scarier things. Really,  as Harry gets older, his audience gets older. What is little Harry Potter  going to see when he is seventeen? How more terrible can they get? Other  than that, I found the ending a little unsatisfactory, as always. J.K.  Rowling has managed to leave multiple questions hanging in mid-air  screaming READ THE NEXT BOOK. I thought Hermione was changing somehow with  her um ...romance with Krum, the Quidditch Champion Seeker. I really liked  the book though, don't misunderstand.

A well  developed character is one that has depth, that shows many, often  contradictory traits--like a REAL human being.

Do not mention these  books in the same breath as Lewis or Tolkein--they bear absolutely no  resemblance. As for the fact that so many people love them--there's no  accounting for taste.  These books have yet to win any awards for  children's literature or for fantasy or science fiction literature.  AND  THEY WON'T!

I was a 'non-believer' in the series and until 5 days ago I had never read a single  page. Now, in five days, I have read them all. What is so captivating about  these books? They simply plunge you into another world. A world of Muggles,  Wizards, and even elves and dragons. All that read the books feel as if  they've attended Hogwarts and experience everything that Harry has  experienced.<br />This fourth novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, is  immense (734 pages). I have experience with long novels, being a Stephen  King fan, and know that they usually get draggy and you think to yourself,  &quot;Why couldn't they leave that part out? Did we really need to know  that?&quot;<br />In all the long novels I've read (over 400 pages), I have  experienced that at least once during the book. This novel, however, is the  exception and actually the opposite. You hate to see it end and now I  believe it will be torture between now and the release of the 5th  installment.<br />Everything about this book is great. Richly plotted, with  twists that will make it nearly impossible to forsee the ending. Who the  heck said these books were predictable?<br />About halfway through you  believe that you have it solved the mystery, but then you find that you  were SO OFF that you wonder how you could be so dumb. When you find out the  true ending you think, &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot;<br />Since I  must be nearing the 1000 word limit, I'll leave you with these last words:  Buy the books, cancel all appointments for the next week, and read them.  You'll find that you'll want to do nothing else.	2000-07-26

I read this one over two days and never got bored.  It was interesting to see how Harry and the other characters and their  relationships are changing as Harry grows up.  I think the author managed  that very well, it added depth to the charactors amd made them quite human.  The ending was rivetting and sets the scene for a great story in the next  book - I hope the author can keep her work rate up and not run out of steam  until the final three books are written.

I  loved the whole idea of the tri-wizard tournement.  After all, if Hogwarts  is the English model, there must be other wizarding schools from other  parts of the world, right?  Will we meet New Zealand, Indonesian and South  African wizards in the upcoming books?  The action is engrossing as always  -- there's even a potential love interest.  The new characters are great  (old mad-eye moody).  We don't see much of Draco Malfoy, but I have the  feeling he'll be back.  Dumbledore is my favorite -- he brings back  memories of Gandolf from The lord of the Rings.  This is a fantastic read  that all devoted fans will enjoy.	2000-07-25

That long wait for it seemed like an  eternity! Then Finally...it was released! I went to a book store a couple  day after to pick it up, and to my horror....they were sold out! I went and  even checked 3 or 4 stores, all sold out! A book...sold out! I could not  believe it! Finally I decided to order it off amazon. When I got it, I read  it that night. I had it finished in 4 days, and for a lack of better words,  it was amazing! I loved the idea of it being darker, more evil, more  sinister. The story was really good, one of the best so far.

Though a lil too much emphasis in the Quiditch Cup parts. It felt like Rowling was trying to cram in every  important and past wizard or witch they had met or are haven't met in the  Ministry of Magic and wizarding world.

But for the first time, stores opened at 12:01 and people lined up for...a book.<br />More to the point, a CHILDREN's book.<br />But then  again, I shouldn't be surprised about that, this series has broken the  rules all along:<br />-At the time I write this review, there are already 2410  of them on this website,<br />-It is so successful that the other publishing  companies have successfully forced the New York Times to create a separate  children's bestseller list, so the &quot;real&quot; books will have a shot  at the number one spot.  (In three years, that list will feature all seven  Harry books, and they'll just pick three others to fill in spots 8,9 and  10.)<br />So while my family waited to go out on July 8, my silence and  immovability made clear that we were waiting for my friendly local fedex  man to deliver my copy from a certain online bookseller whose name shall go  unsaid (but just look at the top of your screen).  It arrived, and three  days and change later (with forced but tasteful breaks for work, food, and  personal hygiene, not neccessarily in that order) I had torn through all  734 pages.<br />With each book I become more amazed with Jo Rowling's writing  ability.  The most throwaway details in earlier books reapparate later to  become important plot points.  I find myself wondering if she had it  planned all along, or does she simply scour the books for something to  use?<br />The characters are growing and changing.  The opposite genders makes  themselves known to our heroes.  The world is opened up a bit-we learn  there are OTHER schools of magic.  Secrets of Hagrid's past are revealed.  Dumbledore is once again shown to be  a powerful force to be reckoned with,  and much like the author herself, I look at Albus and ask &quot;How much of  what going to happen does he already have planned?  Exactly how much is he  controlling and helping what's happening in his world?&quot;<br />There's  humor, there's adventure, and there's not a single moment that I was  reading this wondering when something was going to happen.  It's going to  be a long year waiting for the next one.  Judging from the ending of this  one, it looks like book five is going to be quite serious indeed-no less  than preparation for war.<br />I think before the series is over (and almost  certainly after) we'll start seeing short story collections by Jo and  possibly other authors, illuminating all the details and throwaway bits of  the series that ravenous fans would love to hear more about.  For  example...exactly how does Mr. Ollivander get his unicorn hairs and phoenix  feathers?  I can't imagine all of them are supplied willingly.<br />J.K.

I was so taken with the books that I stayed up until two in the morning to finish the first book and the next day I would do nothing until  I had read the second book. I then immediately ordered the whole series  including the third book from the UK. The fourth book is definitely JK  Rowling's best work. It is vivd and captures the imagination of the  readers. Many people complain about the length of the book but that is the  best part of the book. The book is so long that you learn so much about the  characters that it is understood why Neville is so afraid. The charcters  become real and you can see their personalities more than in any other  book. Some people complain that the writing is mediocre but honestly who  cares. The book is no Ulysses but no one was ever claiming it was. The book  is so charming because of that reason. The book is pure fun and it is a  relief to read after many deep and moralistic novels.

Rowling told us her fourth book would be darker, Iwonder if parents understood what that meant. While I enjoyed herstorytelling immensely once again, especially the Quidditch World Cup and the dragon challenge, and I found it easy to forgive a few sensless plot inventions, many elements of her story make me happy I do not have to wrestle with the pressure to keep it from or share this book with an adolescent. I knew this book was different from the first three early on when adults, students and Harry himself started using &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;dammit&quot; quite casually. The students' humor and practical jokes became more bawdy and crude, yet seemingly well-suited for kids just turning 14 (by the way, is Harry the only one of his friends to ever have a birthday?). I thought the darker elements would be along the lines of the activities at the World Cup when innocent people were tortured for sport and a scull with a snake slithering from its mouth was projected in the sky. But the light fun and seeminly low body count do not prepare the reader for the last few chapters...Such violence would not be as troubling if it was not later dignified and explained by the kindly Dumbledore as a noble sacrifice to the cause and as an example to the other Hogwarts students that their fellow students' death could easily be their own if they do not know the truth about the evil lurking out there. I found these were not just scary images flashed briefly on a screen that produce only enough harm to conjure a few nightmares, but ideas that add to adolescents' glamorization of violence and trajedy. Many high school freshman of Harry's age read &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in literature classes and then glorify suicide as a romantic and plausible end to a troubled love affair. I certainly would not hold Ms. Rowling's books accountable for any bad behavior of her readers, but rather hope parents' consider these elements before putting the book in the hands of young children without at least discussing some of its elements with them.n without at least discussing some of its elements with them.	2000-07-24

It did not feel at all organic and, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, it was unnecessarily convoluted to reach it's climax.  The previous book in the series held together as unified wholes. This one  felt tacked together. It's as if Rowling was thinking ahead to books 5-7  and thinking of the plot lines she'd have to set up, rather than  considering what would be a good book in and of itself. That said, it was a  light and funny volume with lots of the weird magical devices that I love  to read about.

Ages 9-12 shouldn't get to have all the fun!  &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; is a terrific story for anyone who has ever wanted to fly or gazed longingly at a poster of a favorite athlete, wishing that athlete  could come to life.  JK Rowling makes it happen and if your imagination  hasn't been too stifled and trodden down by the concerns of everyday life,  then this book might be for you, no matter what your age. &quot;The Goblet  of Fire&quot; is exciting, funny, frightening and impossible to put down.  I kept telling myself &quot;just one more chapter&quot; until I had  finished the final 450 pages in one fell swoop!  The hype and hyperbole  proved to be fully justified and Ms Rowling has shown herself to be a  wonderfully creative and insightful writer.  As a junior high and high  school English teacher, one of my main frustrations is the fact that my  students don't want to read for pleasure, even when given time to do so in  class.  However, the Harry Potter series has renewed the hope with which I  began my career 15 years ago, that books and good, old-fashioned  story-telling and imagination weren't yet out of style.  Thanks, Ms  Rowling, for Harry Potter, Hermione, Ron and the rest of the Hogwarts gang,  yes, even Draco Malfoy, the kid we all love to hate!  And thanks, too, for  bringing back my own junior high memories after all these years with your  refreshingly honest and accurate portrayals of young boys and girls  discovering new experiences and getting to know each other again for the  first time.	2000-07-24

I have read all of the Harry Potter books and I simply loved number four.  I have also never been stopped by so many strangers on the street to be asked about a book.  It seems as tho everyone  wanted to know how the book was and if I had read the previous three.  I  told everyone that still has an inner child to run out and buy this book  (as well as the first three).<br />JK Rowling seems to be getting better with  age and experience as does Harry.  She has really expanded her wings in  this installment of the Harry Potter series.<br />While the book begins  exactly the same as the past three books - with Harry stuck at the  Dursley's for the summer and his friends the Weasley's must rescue him so  that he can go to the Quidditch world cup finals - readers will be happily  pleased with the rest of the book.<br />But this is where the similarities  stop and the real imagination begins.  Without saying too much - this novel  is (obviously) longer than the previous three and while most people were  stunned at the start of the book - I think I can safely say no one wanted  it to end.  I would have been happy with another hundred pages.<br />Things  turn for Harry in number four - as he reaches adolescences he has to deal  with all the ups and downs it brings with it, a first crush and a painful  loss as well as taunting and trying to discover who he really is.<br />This  book is once again a triumph for readers of all ages.

When I was listening to all of the STUPID advertisements for this book, I was thinking that the book would be better than the other three, mainly because in longer books the plot is normally more interesting.  Well- this  book was surprising, but it wasn't because it was the best, it's because it  was the worst.  The plot slows almost to a stop in the middle, and it's  hard to get back on track. This series is origional, but personally I have  to agree with my mother, that the only reason the series is so popular is  because there's nothing out there.  No other books are written for this age  group, so when somebody finally does write one, everyone says they love it,  they couldn't put it down, whatever.  Would you like to know why they  couldn't put it down?  Because if they did they would never pick it up  again.  Would you like to know why they say they love it?  Because if they  hated it then they would have nothing to do during those few days after it  comes out when everyone is still trying to force their way through it.  Don't get me wrong, I have read all of the books, but only because Barnes  and Noble was out of the Mercedes Lackey books.  I read this 700 odd page  book in a few hours- I also knew that if I didn't read it then I would hurt  my mother's feelings when she went out and bought it for me.  I would  like everyone out there to know that there are some books for teens out  there, and they don't have to be stuck reading this dribble.  Head for the  books by Mercedes Lackey, or Anne McCaffrey- all of their books are better,  even though none of them have been the subject of radio commercials (or  maybe it's because of that...)

For the most part, this was a great book. It reinforced the  main characters connection to one another, while it also brought Harry and company along in their development as individuals who are getting older. I  think the dark nature of the threat and the resultant consequences is  appropriate to what's going on in Harry's life. He and his friends are  getting older and will naturally be more ready to handle more mature  things. My only complaint is that J. K. Rowling fell back on a rather lazy  trick at the end, the old switcheroo, but otherwise I feel this book is as  good as the others.<br />What I have read in review after review is what  &quot;great books&quot; these are, and the reviewers are right, they are  great books. But I wonder if anyone is as worried as I am about Ms.  Rowling's agreeing to allow the book/s to be made into a film? These books  are great because they encourage readers of every age to want to READ, not  watch a movie. In fact, Ms. Rowling has been hailed all over the globe as  the author who made children want to read again. She's given us all a  wonderful world that we have brought to life in our own minds, and that's  her gift. But what happens when the film is made? What happens to all those  imaginary Potter worlds then?

No book in history has had this kind of pre-publication mania.  It would take a great book to survive that kind of publicity.  Fortunately for  children and adults everywhere, Rowling pulls it off.<br />My biggest concern  about the book is its length.  When I heard about the size this book was  going to be, I thought Ms. Rowling might have bitten off a bit more than  she could chew.  I, for one, enjoy long novels.  In fact, one of my pet  peeves about the modern novel is that these 180 page knock-offs are being  touted as novels.  However, a long novel that is very readable, especially  when your target audience is kids, is a major task--a task Ms. Rowling  accomplishes admirably.  The conceit of the Triwizard Tournament really  keeps the book going and opens up a lot of possibilities for interaction  with the other magic schools which I think can really add something to the  future books.<br />If I have any concern about the book is that it really  leaves me wondering about the future books.  I enjoyed the &quot;school  atmosphere&quot; of the first four books which I don't think can be  sustained since a pitched battle with Voldemort must be coming.  Real life  is going to draw the focus away from Hogwarts.  I hope this doesn't happen  to a great extent.<br />Still, this book shows that book 5 will be another  bestseller, and deservedly so.  I know that Ms. Rowling writes for children  and I'm not one but I've always said that a truly good &quot;children's  books&quot; will also appeal to adults.  This series certainly does and I'd  like to compliment Ms. Rowling for a job well done.  I look forward to  future volumes with the excitement of a child.	2000-07-24

JK Rowling handles the plot with penache and delivers a story that has her readers clamoring for more.  She strings the reader along with clues and  hints, only to deliver a twisted and unexpected ending...or beginning as  she cleverly puts it.<br />She deals out just enough information to keep you  interested, but still curious.  There are still multiple questions left  unanswered and many plot twists that could occur.  The story was excellent  and a wonderful follow-up to the celebrated third book.  My only problem  was with the length.  I think Rowling could have done w/o the repetative  details.  It slowed down the plot and caused the middle of the stroy to  drag.  As a result, book four was fabulous--but short of perfection.  Book  three still remains my absloute favorite.	2000-07-24

I decided last week that I needed to read the Harry Potter books before I could return to my 450 students this fall.

I ordered all four books-- and  in eight days I read all four.<br />I truly enjoyed the characters-- I see a  lot of my young self in Hermione.  As a teacher of young adolescents, I can  tell you that Ms. Rowling hits their emotions and reactions squarely on the  head.  I often giggled as I was reading these, causing my husband to wonder  if he should begin reading about Harry.<br />Although this fourth book is  indeed darker than the other three, it certainly is no more violent than  the television programs and movies that some children watch.  If you are  bothered by swear words, bear in mind that there are a few instances where  &quot;damn&quot; is uttered in the book.<br />All in all, The Goblet of Fire  is fabulous, and I'm excited to get back to my room in the fall to  &quot;talk Harry&quot; with my kids.	2000-07-23

First, let me say I enjoyed this book tremendously.  And I'm thrilled that Rowling is allowing her characters to actually grow up.  The Yule Ball and the way the characters all act is true to form -- I could feel Harry's  teenage terror as he tried to ask out a girl.  Let me also say that I  appreciate the darker side of the book.  There is evil in the world; it  does do real and permanent harm; and the death of a character who can not  come back underlines this.<br />It was also good to get explanations.  Unlike  Harry, I had been wondering what happened to Neville's parents, and I had  been wondering, with all the evil surrounding him, how he could be safe at  the Dursleys.  It was also great to see that Dudley is on a diet at  last...<br />However, I felt that the plot was a bit contrived.  Why would  Lord Voldemort use such a complicated scheme to get Harry?  When there  could have been such simpler and more reliable ways to get him to use a  portkey?  Rowling could have explained this by making the magic of the  championship somehow integral to Lord Voldemort's approach; however, she  did not, and I, like another reviewer, was rather baffled by this  turn.<br />Let me say that I am also looking forward to book number five, when  it comes out.  I also have a question -- who else out there thinks Lord  Voldemort could turn out to be Harry Potter's grandfather?  The father of  James Potter?  After all, we learned in book two that they have the same  type of hair ... or perhaps a great-uncle, or something similar...  This  would be a sort of Star Wars approach but it would also explain why the hat  was so tempted to put him into Slytherin.	2000-07-23

I read aloud, and do  all the voices, which can get tricky when I switch from Hagrid to Hermione  and back again.  But, these books are so well written, with such clear and  explicit detail, that the voices almost read themselves.  And, while  reading, you can almost see the Hogwarts castle, and smell the foods at the  feasts in the Great Hall, and feel the pain in your own forehead, when  Harry's scar acts up. I think that I would read these books, even if I  didn't have a child to share them with.  I highly recommend them, to  everyone. Enjoy!  And if J. K. Rowling keeps writing, we will keep  reading.

I'm a voracious reader, often gobbling 2 or 3 long novels in a day if uninterrupted, and I find so much of the  time I sort of skim through books, reading intently the parts I like best  but skipping over the rest.  When I read the first Harry I was delighted by  how completely immersed in the story I was; it felt like I was in fact  entranced by the story, and nothing from the outside world could distract  me.<br />Unfortunately, I did not find this to be the case with Harry IV. I'm  fond of telling people, it's as if one were making chocolate chip cookies  and doubled the recipe for dough but put in the same amount of chips as for  one batch.  I was greatly disappointed at the lack of details that so  delighted me, especially in the first book.  I guess Harry's book list for  the fourth year should have been a tip-off:  with only one new text  required, it was clear the focus of the book was not going to be on the  children's classes.<br />I also found the subplot of Hermione's desire to  liberate the house elves to be annoying because after all the build up, it  was just dropped.  Did she lose interest?  Will her campaign be taken up  again in future books?<br />I'm sure I'll buy and read the next three books,  but my expectations will be greatly lowered.  My advice to Rowling would be  to take her time -- ignore the clamoring public, and don't call the next  book complete until you are certain that each page is crammed full of  delightful detail.	2000-07-23

This book isn't very realistic, maybe that's why I loved it so  much. It creates a world where anything is possible while meanwhile, none  of it is true in our world! JK Rowling is a writer like no other. I have no  clue how she does what she does, but I'm glad she does because I have never  read books that I liked as much as all 4 Harry Potter books. Many authors  either make their writings very realistic and boring or very unrealistic  and completely stupid. Well JK Rowling has written 4 fantastic books that  are pretty unrealistic, but instead of being stupid they are completely  interesting and very enjoyable to read. So, I think this is one of the 4  best books I have ever read, the others including the 3 other books in the  series so far. But may I suggest that if you decide to read the 4th book,  which you really should, then to read all the other books first because it  will be much more enjoyable and exciting to read! That's all I have to say  and I hope I helped you to make the decision on whether or not you should  read this book!	2000-07-22

Like the first two books, this installment reveals that J.K. Rowling still substitutes rampant,  overstuffed imagination for clever writing and plot construction. There is  no secret behind this book's success with young kids: it reads like a  frantic, gluttonously effects-laden video game in its detail. EVERYTHING is  busy or magical: every ball, doorknob, picture, spoon, broom,  bowl,...EVERYTHING. The magic is so overdone that it becomes hyperactive at  best... mundane and trivial at worst. This book, like its predecessors, is  far from wondrous or mysterious. It finds a place in a culture where  &quot;overload&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;quality.&quot;  Further, Rowling's so-called &quot;brilliant imagination&quot; often comes  across as little more than good old-fashioned, amateurish self-indulgence.  It boils my blood to hear this fluff compared to Tolkien's work. Sadly,  with the Potter series, even books have become nothing more than  sensational toys. DOES IT HAVE A GOOD POINT? You bet! Kids are reading, at  least, and in record numbers. That alone makes Harry &amp; the Goblet of  Fire a great idea for children everywhere. Hopefully it will lead them to  read better works by far better writers. However, the number of ADULTS who  are drawn to the Potter books is utterly stupefying. It shows how low the  bar has fallen in adult literacy (and spiritual desperation!) when adults  start claiming that this series has &quot;changed their lives.&quot; To  adults who say that, I would say &quot;You need to get a life before you  can change it.&quot; Don't get me wrong: this book is fine for kids 9-15.  Anyone younger would probably not understand it. And any adult who sits  around pining for the release of the next installment should be really,  really embarrassed.	2000-07-22

It took a third book to be released before I decided to read them but I don't know what took me so  long.  The Goblet of Fire is yet the most emotional and exciting sequel in  this series.  Harry Potter has proved himself again this time by passing  the tests of the wizard tournament. I recommend it to any  &quot;muggle&quot; who is intrigued and fascinated with the world of  wizardry.

The latest installment of the adventures of the boy-wizard at Hogwarts will not disappoint the legions of Potter fans.  All of Rowling's imaginative and intelligent school kids are back and fill the book's 700+ pages with more of the rapid paced twisty-turny plot that is the hallmark  of this series.  While no spoilers here, some surprises await the reader  as among other things, Harry discovers girls.  The situation of course is  handled deftly with great wit and humor as we expect from the author.  Conversely, this one is a tad darker in tone than the previous three and a  death and its effects on those who survive is very realistically portrayed;  frankly these only add to the vivid realism to be found throughout these  magical fantasies.  After the story's climax, the explanations go on a  bit too long before the book actually ends, but this a minor criticism and  the ending is well worth the wait.  Any author who can get kids to read a  700-page tome certainly has this librarian's respect and admiration.  The  whole series is highly recommended for everyone who enjoys a rousingly  grand read.	2000-07-22

No.  He will enjoy much of the book and wants to keep up  with his siblings.  But this fourth book is much more complicated and  disturbing, more frightening and grotesque, more gory and eerie than  anything my 10 year-old has experienced on screen or between the pages.  I  am an English teacher and believe in challenging children's limits for  reading levels and experiences.  My son will not be harmed if he finishes  the book, but he will probably be quite perplexed and more than a little  scared.  He will probably work on reading it, but we won't press him, and  he may be daunted by the page length.

I had discovered the series a couple months ago, and as soon as I finished Book 3, I was aching for more. Book 4 has been anticipated among millions--and it was definitely worth the wait! It was amazing how after I  finished a book so long that it seemed so short. J.K. Rowling has combined  all of the essential elements of a good story--humor, adventure, thrill,  mystery and a little horror--and they all come together wonderfully in  &quot;The Goblet of Fire.&quot; I feel that the characters made this story  so real, because you can relate to their emotions. The nosy and hideous  reporter, Rita Skeeter, was introduced as a constant nuisance throughout  the book; there to add to Harry, Hagrid, and Hermione's troubles. Moaning  Myrtle makes an appearance once again, but this time instead of blubbering  in her stall, she helps Harry along with a mystery. It's these characters,  among others, who make you smile, laugh, and become frustrated or angry. I  think because you feel how the characters do, you keep wanting to return to  the world of Harry Potter as if you part of it. All three books were  spectacular, but Book 4 is unique because it sets the stage for the growing  plot of the series, and you definitely don't feel the completion like in  the other books because you know something big is ahead. Overall, &quot;The  Goblet of Fire&quot; is a wonderful story that draws you in to an amazing  world you'll never want to leave!	2000-07-20

This book  has a little bit darker atmosphere than the other three books, but it's not  so bad that young children can't read it.  I am not going to talk about the  story, or give anything away, because this book is something that you must  experience on your own.  I can say, though that  I strongly suggest getting  this book A.S.A.P.  Harry Potter #4 is wonderful, and leaves questions to  be asked that will eventually be answered in the next three books.	2000-07-20

I'm probably just reiterrating the reviews of other thrilled customers, but I feel that I owe it to J.K. Rowling to give her book yet another fantastic review. I'm almost 14 years old, still a kid technically, but out  of the specified age limit. What's with that anyway? I've seen kids as  young as 7 or 8 lugging around this 734-page novel. I've also seen 80 and  90-year olds with their noses stuck in this book.  Just for the record- I  read the first Harry Potter book long before the mania hit, but I wasn't  the least surprised when it did. It's almost funny, I was sitting on a  bench outside a resteraut reading Harry Potter and I saw (in a half and  hour) 6 other people reading the Goblet of Fire.  The book itself was  amazing every step of the way. I never once lost interest. My Mom and I are  equally obsessed so when the book came in the mail from Amazon.com, we  wrestled for it. She got it first, but I stole it. She wouldn't let me take  it with me to camp, so she got ahead, but I got back and took it to my  room, and beat her to the ending. I think the hardest part of reading this  book, other than fighting with my Mom over it, was learning to say  Hermione- Herm-my-own-ee instead of Herm-ee-own.  I hope that the next  three books are equally impressive. I know that I, and all of you, will be  waiting anxiously for year five.<br />Thanks, J.K.!	2000-07-20

This 47-year-old kid has been swept up in the Harry Potter craze--and with good reason.  Rowling's books are imaginative, humorous, full of well-developed, off-beat, memorable characters (my favorite is Hagrid),  that grab you and a plot that leaves you wanting to know what happens and  keeps you reading until the very end.  Goblet of Fire is no exception.  A  wonderfully imaginative plot, full of humor, mystery, suspense, that never  lags. I couldn't put it down--a great tale, and a fitting lead-in to the  remaining 3. Parents are cautioned though--as Rowling promised, the story  starts to take on dark undertones--some elements of this book may not be  suitable for the pre-pubescents.  And, as with her other books, Rowling  rushes to the conclusion, tying up a lot of loose ends and bringing some  connection to events in the book that, while an amusing read, seemingly had  no connection with the action at hand.  I didn't mind the 720+ pages, I  almost wish she had used some more to round out to give some more depth to  some of the characters and greater connection to some of the sidebars of  the plot.	2000-07-20

Her first three installments in the Harry Potter series were outstanding, she has outdone herself once more with the Goblet of Fire . I am only 13, but I know a remarkable book when I see one.  The way Miss Rowling began the book was very intriguing. Harry Potter and  his friends are introduced to situations that children around the world  face everyday, with magic and fantasy added. Quite frankly you know you are  reading an excellent book when you can't put it down until 2 a.m., which is  common for Harry Potter enthusiasts such as myself. You get to both love  and despise the characters in the book. You cannot expect things to happen  in the Harry Potter series because of how shifting the topics are. At the  end of each chapter you want to read on. Unexpected happenings pop-up all  over the book. In my opinion the Harry Potter books have terrific  characters, plots, and they are filled with the imagination of a child,  which makes the Harry Potter series so unique.	2000-07-20

In the end I liked Goblet's plot as a whole...But, jeez, would anyone like to concede that, just maybe, Rowling's story telling has become a little long-in-the-tooth?  Yikes!  I, like everyone  else on the planet, anticipated with excitement Goblet of Fire's July 8  release, but, was frankly disappointed to find I could (just) barely make  it thru the books first two chapters!  I could not believe how different  book 4 was from 1 thru 3, how distracted the author's writing had become  and how frankly commercial Goblet was.  I have nothing but praise for the  other books in the Harry Potter series but where I could not put the first  three down, with Goblet- I couldn't force myself to pick it up!  I actually  had to read Goblet's last 100 pages to motivate myself to trudge thru the  first 600-plus!  How sad is that?  In conclusion, yes, I did finish book 4  (actually chapters 1-2, then 8-37--I skimmed the rest) and would recommend  book 4 to others, with a word of warning...This book was most definitely  forced!  Goblet's plot could easily have been told in 300 or 400 pages.  I'm crossing my fingers that Rowling finds a better editor for book 5.	2000-07-19

I thought the other Harry Potter books were great, and this is fantastic.  I think the best characteristic of this book is that Rowling finally brings back the biggest bulley in the playground, Lord Voldermort.  You also get the  chance to learn alot about the arch-villian, like why he killed his own  father, what his supporters call themselves, what new form he starts out  the story in, and what becomes of his faithful serveant Wormtail!  There  are also many great details that the former books didn't have, like harry's  love life.  This book, of coarse, like the others, brings back old  characters and introduces new ones.  For example, we learn that Dobby has  now taken up a job as cook at Hogwarts, and Sirius Black, Cho Chang, and  Cedric Diggory each play very large parts.  For new characters, Rowling has  put together a startling array of creatures.  Moody, a powerful wizard with  a magical eye and a wooden leg, Winky, a house elf who's always moping, and  Krum, a famous quiditch player competing against Harry in the Triwizard  tournament (who gets a bit cuddly with Hermione) are just a few of the  strang new characters.  So, from trying to get a date in the next Yule Ball  to dueling Voldermort one on one (who,like Harry, has a wand that contains  one of Fawkse the Pheonixes feathers) Harry is full of surprises for the  eager reader.	2000-07-19

If someone is unfortunate enouph to be that obese, I do not believe it should be pointed out in such a way.  Harry decides to join his friend Ron Weasly and his family to view the Quidditch world cup, a sporting event for wizards that also turns out to be extremely violent, not to mention pointless...

It will have you on your seat with eagerness and suspense. That is what you will hear from critics. What I say is - It is an exciting book that starts from page one and doesn't end until  hours and days later. It is funny, scary, shocking, and downright awesome.  The way Harry works his way through the book is incredible. It is a must  have for al kids and imaginitive adults. It is better than all of the Harry  Potters yet and not just because it is longer and Rowling can fit more  extremely cool stuff into it, but because it is darker and better written  and because it is Harry Potter. That should be enough to tell you how good  it is. It is so good that if you read reviews that tell what happens it  will ruin the book. It did for me so just read this one and go buy it. On a  scale of 1 to 5 stars* I give it 10 stars*. Buy it now before it goes out.  You won't regret it unless you don't get it.	2000-07-19

Without giving away too much,  this one truly is a pivotal novel in the series and it seems like Rowling  has finally gotten her mythology set and in high gear. This novel is not  much darker in tone until the ending which is almost completely devoid of  her trademark comedy until the last couple pages. The ending is brutal,  scary, and exciting. The last few pages hint at more developments to come  but pretty much leave the reader in the dark as to what the next step will  be for the heroes. By the ending you are waiting for the eventual  announcement of Part 5 and the continuing story of Harry and his arch  nemesis Lord Voldemort.	2000-07-19

The storyline takes a more serious turn, setting the  characters up for a major good-vs.-evil battle in the future.

Thisbook is an incredible new addition to the Harry Potter saga. It's awhole new world!  Old fantasy tales and folklore combined with a twist of modern life make this series unique, creative, and virtually indstructible! The first three books were very effective in setting the mood, plot, and establishing character relationships, but it seems that signs of the final battle are becoming more and more apparent. Voldemort's power is growing, Harry is becoming stronger, and the Ministry of Magic is getting more twisted and devious by the minute. Yes, this book is definetly darker than the others.  But I think that this is what the story is about. A boy destined to defeat the ultimate evil and save his world, starting out small and getting more and more skillful. Poor Harry may have not asked for this duty, but that's what makes the book so wonderful! He is a seemingly ordinary kid with extraordinary abilities. He's the person we all dreamed of being, the kind who can save the day and still has to live with everyday problems. We can relate to Harry, idolize him, or both. As usual, the humor and drama were outstanding, and I stayed up until 12 each night reading. I really am starting to get attached to Hogwarts. It has a lot of similarities to OUR schools. Traditions, it's own set of cliques, and teachers that no one really likes, but no one really hates either. With such a familiar atmosphere, it's no wonder we've all fallen in love with this wizarding school. It makes you want to got there, and it makes you feel like you're at a real place. Despite the length, this book is definetly worth it. I can't believe we have to wait a whole YEAR for the next one... I'll be a third year student by then!

The plot was carefully worked out and decided. I liked how J.K. Rowling carries the mystery all the way to the ending, so it has some surprising thoughts. Every Harry Potter fan should read this  book!<br />As Harry begins his fourth year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft  and Wizardy, he receives an invitation from Ron Weasley to go to the  Quidditch World Cup with him, his family, and Hermione Granger. After the  Quidditch game ends, the Dark Mark had appeared, a sign that meant the Dark  Lord was rising to power. When Harry returns to the Burrow, the Weasley  family gives clues and hints to Harry. But to him, it's a mystery. When he  arrives to Hogwarts, he finds out that there is a Triwizard Tournament, a  contest against two rival schools(Beauxbatons and Durmstrang) that hasn't  happened for over 50 years. As the champions work harder than ever, a  mystery occurs. Who put Harry's name in the goblet of fire? Why was Mr.  Crouch found searching Snape's office, when he was supposed to be ill? All  these mysteries are tied up to a much larger mystery. What is it? Read this  book to find out!	2000-07-18

Like the others in the series it is a roller coaster ride with a thrilling climax and many plot twists and turns.  I would caution those with younger kids (my Harry fan is 8) that there are  some dark and disturbing images in this one.  Muggles being tormented for  sport and the callous murder of a character are not for the very young.  I  read Harry aloud to my son and I would advise other parents who do the same  to read a chapter or so ahead in case they need to soften the imagery or at  least not read the scariest chapters right before bed!	2000-07-18

This comes as a surprise considering that the third was so good.  The 700+ page book has enough good parts to make an incredible 300 page story,  but all those extra pages drag everything down.  The author meanders  through the story, slowing it down and draining excitement.  Too much time  is spent building up to the point when Harry arrives at Hogwarts.  From  there, it hardly gets better.  At least one side-story (involving Hermione  and house-elves) seems to have been included just to make the book longer.  I was rather disappointed by the ending, but won't give it away.  I just  hope that Rowling returns more to the form of the earlier books which  featured interesting and tighter plots combined with creative settings.  The only real reason to read the book is that the events contained in it  are vastly important to the future novels.	2000-07-18

As with The Prisoner of Azkaban, the Goblet of Fire sets up events, characters and situations that linger in our memory long after we finish reading the story. That's the mark of great story-telling, regardless of whether that story is aimed at kids or adults.<br />Events from book-to-book are starting to move like an accelerating steamroller.

This is a  pivotal point and big change in the series, and instead of being  open-and-shut, it's more like a stepping stone that leaves you begging for  more.

This fourth installment in the Harry Potter series is sure to leave readers as spellbound as the first three.  Full of surprises and plot twists, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading - I stayed up all night reading it on July the 8th until I finished it at 7:30  the next morning, which I didn't even do for the other Harry Potter books.  And just when I thought the action was over - and almost trembling from  the, for lack of a better word, scary, action, I might add - I got another  shock.  I won't tell you what it was, but Harry Potter and the Goblet of  Fire was definitely one of the best books I've ever read.  However, it left  even me frightened and depressed, and I've been reading R. L. Stine's Fear  Street since I was eight years old.  Goblet of Fire, while still something  of a children's book (albiet a long one) would not be the best book to read  to a nightmare-prone 6-year-old.  The &quot;big scary part,&quot; as  someone I know called it once, was actually one of the things that made it  such a good book, though.  I would definitely recommend this book and I  regret that I can only give it five stars.	2000-07-18

This book also masterfully steers Harry through a turning point in his life without making it overtly obvious to readers.  We are not bludgeoned over the head (so to speak!)  with Harry's teenage angst; instead, it is woven into the narrative.

K. Rowling's latest installment in the Harry Potter series does not disappoint.  Continuing the saga of Harry Potter and his friends, the book recounts their exploits in the fourth of seven years as students at a modern day wizarding school somewhere in England.    Despite its length, the book is as tightly plotted and well written as the first three books in the series; the writing still seems targeted at the juvenile market, though as with all good juveniles, it is eminently readable by adults as well.    The book introduces a number of new characters - one reason for its increased length - and even the adult staff of the school, familiar from the preceding books, seems more deeply characterized in the present volume.  For this adult reader, the activities of these supporting adult characters, hinted at in the text, seem far more interesting that those of the protagonist and his friend.    The one troubling aspect of this book is that Harry Potter is not quite a worthy hero.  He stands by his friends, fights for the good guys, and foils evil, yes; however, he is too willing enjoy discomfort inflicted on those who are not in his clique, as evidenced by his treatment of the long suffering Dursleys, a family who has Harry forced on them while he is not at the wizarding school. Recognizing good and defeating evil are important things, but taking comfort in the pain of others is not a lesson that needs to learned, by either children or adults.	2000-07-18

As a high school librarian, grades 8-12, I am thrilled to find a book that captivates my students and helps them to find time to read something other than the required reading at their grade levels.  And Ms. Rowling's ability to plant plot seeds that seemingly have no solution and then to bring together all those seeds into a tapestry of wonder at the end is fascinating.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was really good.&quot;Chamber&quot; was great.  &quot;Azkaban&quot; was amazing.  ButHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was, well, powerful.  There are many superlatives that could be used to describe it, but none so fitting.  The hype over Book IV was so great that it built a level of anticipation among readers.  And, as I read the book, it only grew. My friend and I mistook lightheartedness for monotony, but upon my second reading of the book, I found how wrong we were.  This book, widely acknowledged to be &quot;dark&quot;, has many hilariously funny, entertaining chapters, especially in the first half, but riddled throughout the book.  This book is indeed pivotal.  The comfortable pattern of complacent endings found in the first three books was not to be found in this one.  The last chapter left me wondering how a book so long could seem so short, and begging for more.  Ms. Rowling's writing style has improved drastically with each novel, but in the fourth Harry Potter book, she reaches a new plateau: a surprising combination of the known and unknown; the natural reactions and the powerful ones.  The job of a fantasy writer is to introduce readers to a new world, and let them believe that they know it, and the characters, as if they live there.  And Ms. Rowling is a tremendous fantasy author.  Her amazing ability left me drained at the end of the book, because I felt as if I knew the characters, and as if their hardships were happening to me.  Ms. Rowling has the unique ability of making us feel emotions-all for words on a page.  And that is the mark of a true, gifted author-one that I can't help but love. Why did I love this book?  It has everything wonderful in it. Excitement, magic, comedy, suspense, House-Elf Liberation Fronts-and a few wonderful digs about tabloid journalism.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire answers a thousand questions-and leaves us waiting with a thousand more.  It shows that a great book does not have to be written for adults, or be a revered, antiqued relic.

If you meet them in the street, don't  say anything, they are trying to fool the muggles. I'm waiting for the 5th  year at Hogwarts.	2000-07-18

I won't discuss the exact plot, but this series is getting grimmer and grimmer!  That in itself wouldn't be so bad, since I'm used to reading grim books, but the only comic relief was obnoxious little comments from the kids!  Yes, I thought they were funny, but one of the things I loved about these books was the funny way in which things were described!

Yes, I think it may be too intense for little children, but at least death is written as a finality and the wizards weren't made able to bring someone back to life.  I think  everyone needs to know that death is a finality in this world and life can  be fickle.  It is all very inventive and don't you wonder, just a little  bit, about the mind that thought all this up?  The creativity amazes me.  The people are real with real emotions whether muggle or wizard. Few are  all good or all evil. Situational ethics are still a problem while the  fight of right vs wrong is not easy and not always obvious who is on which  side. A minor irritation:  There is a typo on page 155, first line.

For those that love them, there is no argument that can persuade him or her to think otherwise. Nor would I want to persuade anyone who cherishes these  books to think otherwise. I think it's a great series, and an historic one  - if for no other reason than it has encouraged parents to read to their  kids (as I do with my 5 boys) more than any other book since Tolkien's  &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; is  not without it's flaws. Rowling's prose continues to be pedestrian at best  - and at worst, irritating. I don't find this too much of a problem when  reading to my kids I can pass over such akward phrases as &quot;'What are  you guys doing?' asked Hermione questioningly.&quot; replacing it by simply  reading &quot;What are you guys doing?&quot; in my rendition of Hermione's  voice (with a questioning tone.)<br />Rowling also needs to drop all the long  paragraphs recapping the events of the previous books. At this rate, Book 7  will be four thousand pages long and 3000 of those pages will be used to  recap what went before. She should start assuming that people have read the  previous books, and keep the recapping to a minimum. If new readers are  losts, that's their problem (which they can solve with a quick jaunt to the  library or bookstore). This change will make for a cleaner, crisper, and  more exciting narrative.<br />My final quibble is that in &quot;The Goblet of  Fire&quot;, we have two chapters near the end that mostly consist of the  villain(s) telling Harry how clever their plans were and what they were  doing behind the scenes during the previous 400 pages. It's nice to tie up  loose ends, but too much of it done in this fashion is boring. Rowling  needs to get away from these soliloquoys.<br />If in future books, Rowling's  prose can grow to match her vision, she will have created a work for the  ages.<br />But beyond that, &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; still manages to be  an exciting book with great characters. Rowling's wonderful inventiveness  in creating this world of wizards, muggles, magical creatures, and dark  forces, still inspires. She has also lost none of her ability to make me  laugh outloud while reading - without compromising the integrity of the  story or the characters. No small feat that. Finally, &quot;The Goblet of  Fire&quot; takes the story of Harry's life in new and unexpected  directions.<br />I eagerly await the next volume and I envy anyone who has  not yet met Harry Potter.

I have read many books in series by other authors and have always found that  sequels never quite achieve the novelty and excitement of the first book in  the series.  Not so with Harry Potter.  Each book in the story is fresh,  introducing new characters and situations involving Harry and his  extraordinary friends.  Many have said that this book is &quot;darker&quot;  and not as appropriate for children as the previous three.  I believe that  the story line merely reflects Harry's entrance into adolecence.  As an  adult I find these books refreshing, captivating and a phenomenal read.  I  have finally turned the book over to my 9 year old who unfortunately had to  wait for me to finish before starting &quot;her&quot; book!  For those of  you who may be interested, this book and series provide a literary banquet.  Happy Reading Muggles!	2000-07-17

Its complicated plot and characters makes this book interesting to the end. I read the book throughout a whole night, and stayed up until 2:00 am to finish it. Once  you start you won't be able to put the book down. You learn more about  Harry and his magical community then you have ever before.

Wizards must decide where their loyalties lay and to what  extent they will be willing to fight.

A year ago, my mom bought the first two books in the series for my little brother and he didn't want to read them, so I said that I'd give it a go so she didn't have to buy them for nothing.  Let's just say I've been hooked since the first chapter in the Sorcerer's  Stone.  I raved to my friends about them (they were a little skeptical,  given that we're 16), but I lent the book to them and now they're just as  crazy as I am about Rowling's wonderful creations!  Naturally, I bought the  Goblet of Fire the first second I could, and I didn't put it down until it  was done.  This book is darker and deeper than the others (and so far, is  tied for my favorite along with the Chamber of Secrets), and the characters  develop beautifully as you watch them grow during their fourth year at  Hogwarts.  Also, this book is where the general plot of the entire series  starts to kick itself into action. The new book's arrival has renewed my  love of the series, so I have started to reread all of them.  It's amazing  the way that Rowling captures the imagination and sparks the interest of  the kid inside all of us that still wants to wave their magic wand and turn  a match into a needle.  (You guys know what I'm talking about...) I don't  even see why we bother to write reviews, everybody in the world already  owns the book!  The only bad thing I could possibly say is that we're  seven hundred odd pages closer to the end!  I love this series, I love  Harry Potter, and I love Rowling!  I can't wait for the next book to come  out!	2000-07-17

I was very, very wrong.  I  finished the book in less than one day, because once I started I could not  stop. I have considered J.K.

With many of the  books I read, I find myself counting pages until the end, but with this  book, I was so hooked that I never wanted it to be over.  It is  considerably darker and more frightening than the other 3 books, but it is  still humourous in many parts, and very exciting.	2000-07-17

I admit when I first started reading this book, I was a little wary of the way it started off. I didn't  really enjoy Harry and his friends at the Quidditch World Cup; I missed  Hogwarts. But I trusted Joanne Rowling and knew her writing well enough by  now to know that the build up at the beginning had an important role,  dropping hints that would later crop up in the book. And boy, did  they!<br />Such a thrilling adventure - but very dark. Harry suffers more in  this book then any other, and at times it is painful to read. But life,  like fiction, is not all smiles and happiness, and Miss Rowling must be  praised for not patronising the readers of that fact.<br />On a more personal  note - and forgive me for indulging in this for a moment - I can honestly  say Harry Potter is helping make my life better. I do get depressed quite a  lot and this is when I turn to childhood things like Disney and musicals to  cheer me up, but nothing has helped bring the magic back like the Harry  Potter books. I am 21 years old, a University student and have read  hundreds of books in my time, but never have I longed for a books' release  as I have Harry Potter.<br />This is a fantastic, sumptious story; romantic  (yes, love is in the air!) exciting, touching and terribly sad; you won't  be able to put it down.<br />The best book out this year. Un-put-downable.	2000-07-17

Never have  I had the pleasure to read a series that has gotten *consistently better*  with each sequel.. not until Harry Potter, that is.<br />After staying up far  too late on the seventh (or would that be far too early on the eighth--?),  I stumbled out of bed and brought the newest book with me to the gym,  drawing some interesting looks from the folks around me as I kept my eyes  riveted to the pages instead of the treadmill readout. My only regret is  that I couldn't continue to read it when I did my laps in the pool! =)<br />Rest assured, those who doubted, that Rowling has, once again, surpassed  herself. Not since Roald Dahl have I enjoyed so-called &quot;children's  books&quot; so immensely; Rowling's dark sense of humor and knack for the  fantastic remind me of such classics as &quot;The Witches&quot; and  &quot;Matilda,&quot; favorites of mine since I was a young'n. But curse the  woman for writing so well -- it takes me one day to read the books, and a  year for the next to come out!<br />Ah well. That's what rereading is for, I  suppose.	2000-07-17

Harry has awoken from a particularly vivid dream that makes his scar pain tremendously.

He, Ron, and Hermione discover romance, and the difficulties it presents, and in the end there is a spectacular culmination of events that will leave you hanging onto this book for dear life.<br /><br />About that person who dies in the end, you might expect it, you might not, but I challenge you great minds out there to solve the even bigger mystery of who the traitor at Hogwarts is before it is unravelled for you.<br /><br />This book has it all: mystery, fantasy, intrigue, morals, even a little bit of romance thrown in.

Let me make it perfectly clear - I thoroughly enjoyed book 4 ofthe Harry Potter books.  My favorite so far is &quot;Harry Potter andthe Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; I think that is because everything was so new and foreign in Potter's world, that I delighted in everything.<br />&quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; held me rapted from beginning to end.  I could hardly wait for the Triwizard Tournament to begin.  Rowling is great at keeping the suspense line going as well as wonderful at wrapping up all the loose ends of her stories.  She has a marvelous way of creating the most special of worlds.<br />So why do I ask who IS Harry Potter?  Because at the age of fourteen I have been waiting for him to mature.  At the beginning of the book he seemed to me to be quite a child yet.  Then there were times he acted more adult than most adults (which is normal for many teens :)) but I never really get of sense of who Potter is anymore.  Is he a geek, a jock, a nerd, an academic, a mystic or spiritualist?  He is almost bland, perhaps that's the point and I'm too thick to get it.  I wouldn't mind him being bland, but then he does this marvelous stuff - how?<br />Anyway, I would love to see him developed further, preoccupied with girls/boys - whichever . . .  hangin' with the guys . . . out doing some flying just for the fun of it .  . . really getting hooked into something (spells, charms, transfigurations) and have him cry. This would have been the year to do it . . . but instead he wasn't allowed - poor Harry, not allowed to enjoy the mothering he seeks.  Ah well.<br />Still all in all, I wolfed down the book in a few days and enjoyed myself immmencely.<br />Signed, an ardent fan.	2000-07-17

This appeared several times in the text and I thought that teachers reading this book aloud to their classes may stumble over it . . . in addition, one part has a wizard refusing to wear &quot;muggle&quot; trousers because he likes to feel the wind &quot;between his privates.&quot; - I'm no prude, but I hardly think this is appropriate for the lower ages experiencing this series.<br />I also was a bit disappointed with the beginning - I look forward to how Harry is going to give the Dursley's their comeuppance before going off to Hogwarts.  This one didn't deliver as the other three did on that point.<br />All in all, the story was deeper and more involved, darker, richer and more satisfying. Several plot developments easily lend themselves to the next in the series (S.P.E.W. for example, was never resolved.)  At this point in the Harry Potter phenomenon, a good or bad review will not make much difference.

It is the most intense book of the series and its 734 pages was  anything but long. I've read books with less than 300 pages that seemed  like virtual tomes compared to the Goblets of Fire. A pure delight from  beginning to end. Now, a recommendation...if you enjoy this sort of  fantasy...be you adult, or child...read anything written by John Bellairs.  I discovered his books over 10 years ago, and until Ms. Rowling appeared on  the scene, few writers (in my opinion) had come close to attaining the  level of intelligent and entertaining story telling as John Bellairs.  Unfortunately, Mr. Bellairs died a few years ago, but he has left a large  number of his works behind. Any of them will be well worth your time.They  are all much shorter in length than the Harry Potter series, which may  appeal to some readers and are all available in paperback...much less  expensive.

As an adult reader and elementary school teacher, I read the first book in the series after my students told me it was the best book. After one book, I was totally hooked on Harry. I had never even read fantasy until this  series, but it is incredible! This book is by far Rowling's best and well  worth the read. I read it in 3 days and even stayed up well into the  morning to finish it. My only disappointment was that Rowling had said she  was killing and important character and after reading the book, I was  disappointed to see that it didn't happen. If you haven't read the other  three, start there first and then read this. And if you're a parent who is  hesitant to let your kids read it, don't be. There's nothing evil in these  books and they are getting kids who don't read into reading!	2000-07-17

Rowling's fourth installment in the Harry Potter series, I was not disappointed.  On first sight, the novel would seem intimidating by its 700+ pages.  Not to worry.  The pages fly by, the  action is swift, the story entertaining and in some instances funny, and  her descriptions keep the reader locked into the story, not straying away  and wondering what's for dinner.<br />The &quot;bad guys&quot; in the story  keep the suspense moving right along, right up to the end.  Malfoy, the  continuous thorn in Harry's side, is as deliciously malicious as ever, and  there are many plot twists and turns to keep the reader on the edge of  his/her seat.<br />Rowling has done a magnificent job in developing characters  - all the way down to the descriptions of each and how the characters react  to each other.  I am particularly fond of Ron's tiny owl,  &quot;Pig&quot;  (short for Pigwidgeon) who reminds me of an over-excited puppy that is so  pleased with himself for getting to do a job, that he piddles all over the  floor.  Pigwidgeon doesn't piddle, but his overexcitement is obvious.<br />All  in all, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; was a very  enjoyable read.  J.K. Rowling does a good job of explaining a few  &quot;inside things&quot; to readers who may not be familiar with them, and  doesn't stray from the story in doing so.<br />I'm only sad because the story  ended and I have to wait for Harry Potter to spend his summer at the  Dursley's before I can read about his 5th year.  What a sensation these  books have turned out to be!	2000-07-17

J.K. Rowling issimply amazing; she always keeps me thinking, and you never know what you're going to expect. The story goes like this:<br />Harry Potter is a wizard-in-training who is well-known for a tagic accident that he survived, but his parents didn't. He goes to one of the the magic-teaching school called Hogwarts in England. This year a Triwizard Contest is taking place, where 3 students, (one from each of the 3 major magic schools) are chosen from a Goblet of Fire, to compete for The Triwizard Cup. The Goblet mysteriously chooses Harry Potter's name to compete. The rest of the book is about Harry and the contest, and an unplanned confrontation with Voldemort- the most feared Dark Wizard. This is an unforgetable book that cannot be missed. Just make sure to read the 3 other Harry Potter books first. I'm sure you'll love it, and become another Harry fan!<br />*Due to the popularity of these books, many younger kids have read them. They are very good books for most everyone, but I have to admit they can be kinda scary. I suggest that children under 9 should read it with their parents or wait till they are older. This is a wonderful and fantastic read, as long as you undertand that it is all fantasy.<br /> Have Fun Reading!	2000-07-16

I don't recommend this book to people  who haven't read the three Harry Potter books because you'll be very  confused. I was when I first started the book. I had to remember what I  read in the other books for this book to make any sense. But it's still  excellent besides the fact there are eight curse words in the book.

It seems that evrything in theprevious 3 books leads up to the conlusion of book 4.  I will not reveal the conclusion, but it seems JK Roling has now set up the plot for the next 3 books.  She has also hinted that the next 3 will be darker, and judging from this one, I believe her.  I am 14 years old and I love the Harry Potter series.  I love the characters and atmosphere of the novels.  I hope they each get longer as I savor each one, and each ending leaves me craving for more.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire fleshes out the chatacters even more and they mature beautifuly.  I could relate to their emotions and situationd, being as I am the same age as the characters are depicted.  I espcially like the premise of the crushes among the students and the Yule Ball chapter was brilliant.  I am surprised JK Rowling isn't 14.  All in all, Harry Potter and the Goblet if Fire is the best in the series yet (though it didn't have the amazing twist ending of book 3) and I hope it continues in the darker directions the ending hints at.  (Parents with younger children beware, this is a MUCH more mature book then the previous ones, and deals with mature themes as racism, fascism, genocide, tabloids, politics, boyfriends/girlfirends, and murder. Though these themes are presented in a way of showing what is right and wrong, some of the darker scenes may firghten young children.  I suggest any parent who is considering buying the book for a child under the age of 8 or 9 read the first chapter before making a decision.  The first 3 are A-ok though) END	2000-07-16

Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire was an excellent book. It had much to live up to with the attention it got from the media, and it surpassed all expectations. I was definetly impressed with the writing in this book,  right from the beginning you are hooked! The Quidditch World cup is  brilliantly described and is where the danger begins for our favorite hero.  After surviving the rather unusual events that followed the match, Harry  returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year. Dumbledore springs a surprise upon  the students with an announcement which turns Harry's world upside down for  the school year (I will not reveal what the announcement is, you'll have to  read it to find that out!). Over the following semesters Harry plunges into  more danger, and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named(Voldemort) awaits his chance to  rise again. The ending to this book is full of excitement, and leaves you  aching for the next book. Also in this book, we find Harry a little more  grown up, and discover his feelings for a particular Hogwarts student. For  those who have not read Harry Potter before, I suggest you start. Fans of  the first three Harry Potter books will be impressed with this new and very  exciting installment in the already popular series.	2000-07-16

Are you below 100 years old? You'll love it. (The only people who wouldn't love this amazing book are the ones who go to an Ivy League school and major in fine literature, for the fun of  making fun of children's books; maybe Harry Potter is not  &quot;literature&quot; to those types of people, but it's a classic epic in  its own class) So, HARRY potter is like Star Wars with more interest, and  magic. Anyway, I'd rather read a classic than &quot;fine literature&quot;  because i believe that most of us don't enjoy ALL the books we read in  school. By the way, we must write to the author and complain that the word  &quot;cool&quot; is too American. Has anyone but me noticed how she tries  to throw in American slang ... and how it sounds totally awkward in such a  Brit-sounding book?

Once again, as in her previous books, the author draws the reader in on the first page, keeping him under her spell  through the volume's 37 chapters.<br />This book further chronicles the life  of boy-wizard Harry Potter, who attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry and often finds himself in...situations.  As Harry continues his  fourth year at the school, he becomes involved in the Triwizard Tournament,  goes on his first date, and meets other young wizards from around the  world.  In this book, as in the previous three, Rowling fills in the gaps  of Harry's knowledge (and the reader's)of his past, but leaves us in enough  suspense to wonder what could possibly happen next...<br />This book cetainly  exceeded my expectations, which were already high.  With the other books  being as great as they were, it was hard for me to believe the author could  outdo herself.  The sheer size of the book is a treat in itself, although  the real treasure lies inside its covers.  Having learned from experience,  my fiance and I purchased two copies, ensuring no fights would ensue over  who got to read it first.<br />One can only hope that Rowling has enough house  elves to help her with her daily chores such as cooking and  cleaning...anything to keep her writing, so book five will arrive that much  faster!	2000-07-16

Therefore, shouldn't Lily have appeared to  Harry BEFORE James?  Just a bit of trivia for the HP devotees!

Often, sequels don't hold a candle to the books that preceed them.  This is an exception to the rule.  Rowling has done yet another excellent job of following up great with better than great.  Without giving the plot away,  Harry is again faced with danger to overcome that does not step anywhere  near the realm of monotony.  Rowling's imagination is boundless and  unpredictable, every chapter leaves you chomping at the bit for what's  coming in the next one.  New characters are introduced into a seamless  genre developed and adhered to by all four books.  The characters that we  already know remain true to their natures yet are every bit as  unpredictable as they have ever been.  The author has again masterfully  blended human motivation, humor, intrigue, suspense and imagination in a  700+ page book you'll wish was double in size. If you haven't read the  previous three, Rowling does an excellent job of referencing and briefly  explaining occurrences in all previous books so you're not left wondering  and not too elaborately to bore you if you have.  However, missing out on  the first three books and just reading this one is a form of  self-deprivation I would not recommend.  For the moment, I'm glad Harry's  adventures have paused for a year, if there was a new Harry Potter book  released once a week, I'd never get any work done. Enjoy!	2000-07-16

J.K. Rowling is clearly seeking an older audience (or, more likely, is mindful that adults as well as children devour Harry's adventures), and the result is a novel that has some genuinely horrific scenes...  At times, it's almost as if Rowling handed the manuscript over to Clive Barker and said, &quot;Here, why don't you have a go at it?&quot; Parents of littler Muggles may want to take a look at the book before passing it on--although it's not graphic, there is more violence in this than the other books, and there is some mild profanity, mostly the d-word.  For older fans, this will be but a whetting of the appetite for Book 5.  Rowling is on top of her game (some of the descriptions of the Quidditch World Cup game are hysterically funny, while the darker moments, namely the trials of those involved with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, are exquisitely poignant) and only promises to get better.  For once, the product justifies the hype!	2000-07-16

Voldemort himself makes a much stronger  appearance in this book than he has before, and his battle with Harry is as  tense to read as Harry's bit of trouble with the basilisk in the  &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;.  Harry, Ron, Hermione and friends seem to  be growing up a little quicker than they ought with the timing of the books  ~ in fact, one of the few complaints i had about &quot;Goblet&quot; is that  Harry seems to vary in age from thirteen to fifteen, in rather uncertain  fashion, within the single year the book encompasses.  Certainly the  preoccupations of teenage years, most especially the opposite gender, have  taken a more prominent position in this book than previously.  Once again,  Rowling's characters are, within their world, entirely believable in their  actions and reactions, both as predictable and unpredictable as real  people, and this is, for me, the truest test of a book.  Unlike many other  fads and must-haves ~ Pok&eacute;mon springs to mind ~ the latest Harry Potter  book is worth all the kerfuffle and fuss it has caused.	2000-07-16

This book left me sitting in awe. I'll admit when I started reading I was nearly positive that it would either be Cho Chang or Hagrid that died, but I was wrong, Rowling has never failed to surprise me in these books  when I think I have everything figured out. I'm now going to tackle some  issues that came up with the book, so hang tight. I did not think that  Voldemort could get any more evil, but I was wrong. He has risen again and  he is more deadly than ever. I think that if I saw Wormtail (AKA Peter  Pettigrew) I would attempt to take him down and make a Dementor kiss him. I  mean come On, the guy killed Cedric Diggory in cold blood, he betrayed  Harry's parents and got them killed. He just makes me angry. I am glad to  see the darker, more horrific turn the series has taken in this book. I was  afraid that it would become fun and fancy free and lose its edge, but with  the way this awesome piece of literature ends, I say it is only going to  get darker. The ending leaves me wanting more. Has Dumbledore severed all  ties to the ministry? Is Sirius (my favorite character by the way) cleared?  Is the great Remus Lupin to return to fight with them against Voldemort?  Will the Malfoys get beaten by an angry mob? Am I losing my mind over this?  <br />Well the only thing to do is read this for yourself and decide. Until  next time when the Shadow of the Dark looms over us Muggles, I bid you  adieu.                          - Tom McCord	2000-07-15

Rowling's newest, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but I have some things to say. The book grabs you right from the start. Rowling doesn't bother with as much briefing of previous books as she did with the  first three.  I read all 734 pages in 9 1/2 hours, and stayed up til 4 in  the morning. However, after reading it, I have to say, even though this is  a great book, it wasn't my favorite of the series. Book Three, in my  opinion, was a better book. First off, Hogwarts still had Quidditch, and  even though Goblet of Fire had the Quidditch World Cup, I think Hogwarts  Quidditch is more interesting. Also, Goblet of Fire's climax is a duel  between Harry and Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, etc). Book Three was  slightly more satisfying at the end, and didn't land Harry in the hospital  wing. Goblet of Fire was a great book, and you should buy it if you'd don't  have it, and doesn't get boring in the middle like some long books do. It  was fabulous without a doubt. What I am pointing out is, despite rave  reviews, this isn't the best book of the series.	2000-07-15

Some will suggest that the key ingredients are things like having a certain  amount of plot, an interesting gameplay, believable characters, writing  that is easy to comprehend, an unpredictable roller coaster of mystery, or  an entertaining witty humor.<br />Yet while great movies/games/books (or any  other forms of such media) will tend to have as many of these key  ingredients as possible, it isn't *any* of these that make them stand above  the rest.  And while a combination of many of these factors marks to rare  or uncommon talent, great work is definitely more than the sum of the  parts.<br />The Harry Potter series is something quite special.  When you read  it, you know it isn't just the characters, setting, and atmosphere that are  magical.  It is the *story* that takes all of those key characteristics  (characters with frighteningly realistic depth of personality and  believable motivations, a sophisticated yet followable plotline, a setting  so picturesque it could have been painted on a canvas, delightful humor...)  and crafts them into a very deliberately designed experience.  Throughout  the series, it is very clear to the reader that Rowling knew exactly what  she was doing and exactly how she wanted them to feel.<br />While the first  three books tended to beckon the reader's feelings to the desired effect,  The Goblet of Fire thrusts the reader through subtle combinations of  stronger and more mature emotions that Rowling describes in bright hues of  vivid detail.  You open this book almost twice the size of the others  expecting a heavier read.  You come away in the end almost feeling a  heavier burden on your soul.  Whether you are currently around Harry's age  or reminiscing about when you were, you know how he feels throughout even  the thickest of his ordeals.<br />And for those who ever wonder just what the  big fuss is about, this is one of the better series where it is &quot;worth  the time to find out.&quot;<br />P.S. Also rather cute is how Rowling dispels  some of the common misconceptions about the story (and mispronunciation of  some names).e  or reminiscing about when you were, you know how he feels throughout even  the thickest of his ordeals.<br />And for those who ever wonder just what the  big fuss is about, this is one of the better series where it is &quot;worth  the time to find out.&quot;<br />P.S.

He is also complex, compelling and thought-provoking.  This is  proven most effectively in this fourth novel.  This novel is denser in plot  than most of the so-called &quot;adult novels&quot; I have read lately and  richer in character than most of the weepies that Oprah has recommended in  the last few months.  We were all kids once, and we can all identify with  Harry's  early passage into puberty.  Throw in a great mystery, the rich  development of old friends (Harry and his friends are NOT static characters  like most series I have read, they change and mature with each book) and  you have a great,juicy read.

(WARNING: The following THOUGHTS are rambly and somewhat disconnected, but I just thought I'd be a good citizen and point out some major flaws in this era of Harry Potter hype)---In terms of adventure and general storyline,  all four books are wonderful. JK Rowling certainly has a good, avid  imagination for a mother. These are definitely the books to get your kids  interested in reading b/c it lets them see how enjoyable a reading  experience will be. HOWEVER, being a bookworm all my life (all 23 years), I  can only compare JK ROWLING story imagination rather than her WRITING STYLE  to that of Jane Yolen and Madeline Engle. Her writing is very mediocre and  reads like a Stephen King novel --- simple and screenwriter-ish. Whereas  Yolen's and Engle's novel are much more graceful with excellent diction and  word use, making a stronger reading. It would do no justice for some  hollywood producers like Warner Brothers to make a 'good' Yolen Book Movie.  Traditional readers who have loved Yolen, Engle, and Lloyd Alexander (The  Black Cauldron series) would certainly be disappointed in the Hollywood  version of their books. I mean look what happened to THE BLACK CAULDRON. It  was the most horrible science fantasy book turned movie I had ever seen!  They dropped out important scenes from the original Alexander book. And  that's not even talking about how terrible the animation was. It's no  wonder it did so bad at the box office..but I digress.. .. I predict that  these upcoming Harry Potter movies will not have that same effect on me b/c  these books were WRITTEN for the big screen. Potter book plot lines are  predictable and sweet and made for TV. The only way Warner Brothers would  butcher the movie is if they had harry potter with an American accent. In  this case, the harry potter books would be another case of hollywood  killing good liturature (any books that inspire you to read) b/c I ALREADY  have it ingrained in my mind that the HARRY POTTER BOY IS BRITISH, not  American. So get it RIGHT this time WB. WHATS MY POINT? I personally think  there is a lot of hype over all four books. I read the fourth HP book in  just two days. And I just cant get over feeling how could someone who's  writing style is so mediocre could make millions of american dollars? I  guess it goes to show what sensationalism and a person with a somewhat OK  imagination can do. So parents, if you're looking for books that inspire  them (your kids) to become writers or heck JUST READERS, of the traditional  sort that write 'good' fiction, these would not be the books I would  recommend. I give it a 3 b/c I believe writing style is just as important  as writing a good adventure and JK ROWLING only got a 3 b/c of the good  storytelling part. PS. For a dose of REALLY good science fantasy, 5 stars,  you should read: 1) all of Mollie Hunter books (A Stranger Came Ashore, The  Kelpie's Pearl, etc) Since these books were published some 30 odd years ago  and the last time I read them was 12 years ago, they are no longer in print  but your local library should have them. I also recommend all the Patricia  C. Wrede books and her unicorn/princess books. I would also list all of  Lloyd Alexander  books--all the Prydain novels as well as his other  children series.

Potter does not manage to defeat Voldemort quickly and easily as in the first and second books, but rather barely makes it away with his own life. The ending makes you want to start  saving up for the fifth one, leaving off at a perfect place for a new  adventure. This is the most desired boook among children since... well,  since the third Harry Potter book! Rowling makes the magic world realistic  with a blundering Ministry, a nasty press reporter, owl post, and  &quot;magic in everything from classes to meals&quot;. The plots can take  unexpected turns with potions to transform into other people, Invisibility  Cloaks, and lie-detecting Sneakoscopes. The tone of the book can vary from  horrifyingly grim in he early part of the ending to light-heartedly funny  during weekends (especially when the Weasly twins are around). Althoughy a  tad slower than the others, the 734-page wait simply adds to the suspense  and excitement of reading a book you've been waiting for all year. I  finished whithin ten hours and wished it was 7000 pages instead. An  excellent work of literature, and well worth the wait.	2000-07-15

If  you're a Harry Potter fan, I think the first 150 pages are a bit slow as  much of the story from the first three books is repeated, but once the new  school year starts, the book takes off.  I'm also tempted to say that there  are too many extraneous details, but with Potter, it's hard to know which  details are unimportant now, but central later on.  (Remember Scabbers?).

Rowling's fourth Harry Potter novel is a pleasant and daring surprise.  It is one of the few sequels to not only meet, but also surpass every hope I could have had for it.  She continues to build from the  previous three novels in a way that, wonderful as they are, they now seem  like background fodder by comparison to the richness of the fourth novel.<br />However, I would like to extend a strong word of caution to all parents.  Harry is now 14 years old, and Rowling is writing very much towards a more  mature audience.  Her world now has more complex issues such as racism and  murder (all of which are handled with a depth which shows why Rowling  should never be listed as just &quot;a children's writer&quot;).  A few  deaths occur in the book.  I strongly recommend that parents read the book  before their children so that they can be prepared to help their children  deal with the book's final, _very intense_ chapters.	2000-07-15

We learn the  stories behind the characters, like why Neville lives with his grandmother,  and why Hagrid is so big.

I  think Rowling conjures up a charming world, populated by wild things and people. Her imagination  parallels that of another (older) British writer of children's books, Enid  Blyton, who is unfortunately not well known in the U.S.<br />The weaknesses  to the new book are the same as for the other books in the series:  the  plot lines are rather weak; the villains boring and unidimensional rather  than really scary (does Voldermort keep you up at night? Thought not); the  confrontations between Harry and the villains rather anti-climactic after  the big build-up (the REALLY big build-up in the case of this latest  tome).<br />I think  she is a fun, enjoyable storyteller but I don't think she  is in quite the same league as Tolkien or even C.S.

The book was on my doorstep when I woke up on July 8. I finished by dinner July 9. I kept putting it down, I wanted to savor it. Who knows how long it will be until book five is published. But I could not stop. I had to know  the outcome of the Triwizard competition.<br />This book is darker than the  first three. There is death, not just in the distant past, but within  Hogwarts. There are the premonitions of wide spread evil to come. But there  is still the underlying foundation that most people (wizards and muggles  alike) are good. That light will prevail over the darkness.<br />A friend  with a six-year-old has decided to wait a while before continuing the  series with her child. Each parent should judge for themselves whether  their child is ready to handle the darkness.<br />I am now waiting impatiently  for the Harry's Fifth year at Hogwarts to start. I think it will be the  darkest yet. And I hope it is just as long and full of details as the  Goblet of Fire.	2000-07-14

Very good book, but you'll read enough complements from other people. I will point out the only two real problems instead. One, when the ghosts came out of the wand, Harry's parents came out in the wrong order. This  seems an obvious mistake, and I dont know why the editor didnt catch it.  The other problem is with the whole wand combat scene, which seemed rushed  and not well thought out. But these were the exceptions to a very good  book.	2000-07-14

Generally, the thought that everything would be allright made the other books easier to handle, because you knew people weren't going to die.  But because of the rumors flying on the internet before this book had even been published (and written), pretty much everyone knew that someone we cared about would die. While i'm glad this book wasn't completely dark, the ending still made me cry, and it was a completely different feeling than i'd felt after reading the other three.  While i enjoyed this book very much for its humor and its intricate plot, i was busy anticipating the death of someone unknown.  But this book did live up to Rowling's standard of writing, and the way she displayed the emotions and happenings is, as usual, exceptional.  The end of the book left open a whole lot of plot, but i guess that's how you have to keep us reading!  This book was great because it lasted longer, and i am one who wishes that my favorite books will just keep going.  This one did....it is by far the longest of the series, and that was nice.  There are, of course, new creatures and new characters who add to the story, with Rowling's obvious touch of humor and amusement.  She writes to include the reader, and that is possibly the best move she's made with this series.  She makes it attainable, because the whole series starts out with an average 11-year old, one that every reader can remember being, and creates for him a new world, where he isn't looked over.  Anyway, before i give away the plot, i would just like to say that even though this book is completely different from everything we've seen from Rowling so far, it is still an awesome book, and i think that everyone will enjoy it!	2000-07-14

Rowling talent for storytelling is positvely astounding. I became an instant fan. In the week and a half that we've had these four books I have managed to read them all. I could not put neither of them down. It was only until I fell asleep with my head in the book that I was actually able to put the book(s) down. I especially enojyed Rowling's gradual evolution of her characters. Each of them growing up in their own unique ways, and noticing things because of their growth, that otherwise they would not have noticed before. Book four is the most amazing yet. It is also very different from the other three. Unlike it's predecessors this book will leave the reader wanting more than ever. I myself cannot wait until Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts. the fourth book leaves many dangling plots that will have Harry Potter fans running to the bookstores once again. If you're a new fan, such as myself, or an old fan, young our old, you will simply love this book.

The tone of Goblet is much darker than the previous books, and it crosses the line from adventure to horror story.  Parents should read  the book and decide for themselves if it is appropriate for their children.  I personally feel that some of the scenes are too horrific for a pre-teen.

Harry Potter is back with a longer darker scarier ride then the one's he has faced in books 1-3. A refreshing spin to keep potter from becoming stale.734 pages of straight intrigue as you are swept along with harry from  a burning scar dream that left him reaching for a quill and hedwig to  inform godfather in hiding Sirius Black, to the other twists and turns that  j.k rowling has conjured up in her latest installment.As usual we open to  poor Harry at the intolerable cruel hands of the Dursley's, and the scar  burning dream he had has left harry worried as well as nervous waiting for  a word from black.He however has little time cuz Ron and the rest of the  Weasly clan have a surprise instore for him that would take up most of the  summer up until year four at hogwarts where upon arrival they are surprised  with news of a triwizard tournament with two other schools.New characters  and the onslaught of Darkness. dealing with different schools, starting to  show interest in girls and a tabloid paking quill and even more bothersome  reporter will make its mark on a year harry isn't likely to forget.....Good  swift read.her words are very fluid in that they flow very well.Reccomended  for maybe the 12 and up set may be too long and scary for younger,but if  you like harry potter this long of wait and book is well worth it....can't  wait for five....	2000-07-14

I found this 4th book in theseries to be the least scary and most character driven of all thebooks. Rowling has brought us some new characters, de-emphasized some of the more annoying characters like Malfoy and Crabbe, and again brought good and evil togther in a fight to the death. Like the other books, the villians remain secret till the very end, which keeps you reading with rapt attention. After reading all the hype, I kept waiting for the dark dark part of the novel, but I didn't think it was anywhere near as dark as Azkaban. I thought Rowling injected a lot of humor into this book, and some of the novel was obviously her own FAQ to the potter series, like when Hermione told Victor how to pronounce her name.

When I was finished, it didn't even feel like it had been over 700  pages.  It was the same type of story, and I loved it.  Harry and company  have started to notice little wizards and witches of the opposite sex, and  that amused me to no end (and, I must say, that Ron Weasley never ceases to  amaze me).  I love what Rowling has done with these books--she's  challenging young minds and getting them to read, and that's  fantastic.<br />The thing I found most disapointing about this book, however,  was the title.  In the past, Harry Potter books have had titles with  something major from the story (what would &quot;Harry Potter and the  Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; be without Sirius?).  The goblet of fire didn't  play as large of a role as I was expecting it to... and that kinda  disappointed me.

Goblet of Fire takes the themes and subplots that have been building and brings them to a head.  Previous reviews describing this as the pivotal book in the series are not  exaggerated.  While the entire story is good, in the last 200 pages or so  Rowling ties together all the strings and effectively sets up what will  surely be a dramatic struggle in the books to follow.  The themes in Goblet  of Fire are universal: friendship, family, trust, loyalty, betrayal.

Some of the characters you love, some you  love to hate, and some characters have you so confused that you don't know  whose side they are really on. And Rowling's descriptions of people and  places are so well done that you can just see the character or the place so  vividly in your mind. This is a book for adults as well as children.  For  all of you parents who get tired of reading the same book over and over to  your child, read a chapter or two of this book to him or her.

J. K. Rowling uses so much foreshadowing that i couldn't put the  book down....especially near the end.  The amount and rate of suspense  contained in this novel is incredible, and it has certainly lived up to  EVERYONE'S expectations.  Under definite pressure and strain, J. K. Rowling  has managed to produce yet another thrilling adventure for Harry, Ron,  Hermione (pronounced HER-MY-O-NEE, as we find out somewhere in the middle  of &quot;the Goblet of Fire) to act out for us, while making us feel like  we're a part of it.  It's hard to believe that you're not standing at  platform 9 and 3/4, leaning casually through the wall to catch the Hogwarts  Express with harry and ron.  I, as a 17 year-old avid reader of Harry  Potter, thought that this book had the most plot to follow, and the most  emotion (for the reader) compared to the other books.  Rowling has lived up  to her prevous books, and has possibly even surpassed them with this latest  installment.  She builds up so many stories at once that the reader is  constantly kept busy trying to remember what happened last in each  successive plot.  I loved this book, i think it is the best in the series  so far, despite the fact that it was considerably darker than the rest.   The mention of various dark arts are probably mentioned more in this book  than all the others combined, but with Rowling's humor to soften the blow,  the story keeps us not only hooked, but entranced.  Rowling's new  characters and creatures (cough, HAGRID) made the story that much  better....Dumbledore kept me laughing also...i won't give any of the plot  away, but i will leave you with these last words:  This book will bring out  your sense of humor, along with your sense of foreboding -- basically, you  won't be able to put it down until you've read the last word on the last  page  :)	2000-07-13

This section of the book starts off with mysterious evil and encompasses both great humor and amazing devices like the Weasleys' practical clock and the  thought-retaining pensieve. It also does a masterful job of setting up the  last hundred or so pages. This is where the action takes a frantic pace and  even Ms. Trelawney couldn't predict (like she could anyway) what will  happen next. We also get to a lot of excellent characterization and plot  development in this awesome fourth novel by JK Rowling. One of my favorite  elements was getting to see the contrast between Harry's realization that  Dumbledore is getting old and the power and influence that the headmaster  still wields when he needs to asset his authority.<br />First ~600 pages: 5  stars After that: 10 stars<br />The countdown is on to Book #5 !	2000-07-13

It's a wonderful extension of the series of Harry Potter.  Everyone in our family is in line to read it, but Mom got to go first and I finished in 2 days.  Harry doesn't disappoint with more great stuff at Hogwarts  school and all our favorite characters back again.  This might be a little  more &quot;dark&quot; than the early ones, but I think that #3 is more so.  I loved the new wizard game in it, and having Harry and the gang grow up  just a little is very realistic. There are lots of fun magical creatures  and spells that go wrong to keep things exciting, and good does always win  out in the end.  I like Harry's resourcefulness and the way most adults who  care about him are wise and helpful, but let him figure out how to deal  with problems, too.  I would recommend that parents follow the not younger  than 9 years rating on it, but no one in my family is under 19 and we love  them all!  I can't wait for the next one.	2000-07-13

I read it in  less than two days. I wrapped it in plastic and dragged it along to swim  practice. It was a good idea not to release it during the school year, as  you could probably hear the shouts of teachers throughout the country,  saying &quot;put that book away&quot; or &quot;this is Math class, not a  school of wizardry!&quot;  I couldn't possibly spoil the plot, but I  will tell you that it will make you laugh histerically in some points, and  if you're sappy like me, you will cry at others. The rest of it just helps  to make this the best book I've ever read!  If you think it's all hype,  or are just not sure, read it! Even if you don't buy it, borrow it from a  friend. And once you've gotten past the first chapter and realize you need  to have your own copy, proceed to your nearest bookstore, or Amazon.com and  ORDER NOW!  It may be darker than the others, it may be huge and  long, it may sound boring, but once you are lost in the story, and somehow  come backt ot he real world, you can't help but wish it was longer than its  impressive 734 pages.

This was an amazing book, I just finished it a few minutes ago, after reading straight for about forty-eight hours with small breaks for the bathroom, sleep and meals. This is not as light-hearted as the other three,  but it has all the classic features that you expect from a Harry Potter  book. Harry starts at the Dursleys, counting the days until he can go to  Hogwart's, his beloved school. He and his friends eat cauldron cakes on the  train, and attend the sorting ceremony for a change in this book. However,  as Harry is now 14 years of age, he makes smarter decisions, and is less  awkward. He is finally thinking more on the levels of a young adult rather  than a child. This makes for a better book, as he fully grasps the  implications of exactly what he goes through. Harry makes noble choices  throughout the story, enriching his character, giving the reader a stronger  respect for him as a full character. I ask you to read this book even if  you have not read the other three. It is by far the best, for it is the  most sincere of the four Harry Potter books.	2000-07-13

Personally, this one happens to be in a tight run with Chamber of Secrets,  so I would say that these Happen to be her best. It is lengthy at times,  but not in the sense of being drab. Harry Potter can never be drab in my  mind. No, this book can just get in spots where she sets stuff up a little  slowly.

Although I thought that the book was unquestionablyentertaining like many of the reviewers that have voiced their opinionin this forum, I found the book to be lacking in the sense that it was not a good example of a self-contained book that is part of a series.<br />Unlike the first three books, this volume in the series seems to be playing upon an age-old marketing scheme usually used by the movie industry.  In the end, it causes us to want for the next book of the series instead of feeling the lightening of a burden usually received with the resolution of a book.  It leaves many questions unanswered and many secrets in the dark.<br />Also, I find the dark foreboding at the end of the book to be very similar to another great tale, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot; Also a tale of epic proportions, the Star Wars Trilogy also seems to follow this same pattern.  The second (fifth episode) installment of the Star Wars series leaves us with a dark forboding and created a great hype for the third and final Star Wars.  And, although it was a great movie, it could not stand alone as a movie without the background of the first movie and resolution of the third movie.  This was a marketing ploy by George Lucas, the producer of the Star Wars series.<br />It would seem to me that J.K. Rowling took a page out of Lucas' book (so to speak) when she created the ending for this book.  I do not want to give up too many details, so I shall leave it at that.<br />In conclusion, the book is a good and entertaining book for all Harry Potter fans out there, but leaves us screaming for the next installment.  However, for the uninitiated, I think it would be wise to start with one of the previous three books to immerse yourself into the magical world of Potter before attempting this novel that is more entwined into the series than the rest.	2000-07-13

I consequently stayed up  until 1a.m. to finish reading it.  Basically, if you're a fan, buy the book  so you're up-to-date on Harry's life.

By simple meaning it's not pretentiously overwritten like many of the books that NPR likes to highlight, but not simple like a meaningless romance novel or other such  trite entertainment.  Although I am an adult, I love these books, and can  read them over and over, especially this one, which is very true to the  style formed in the first book, but also different in that the plot writing  is not stuck in a formulaic system like some book series can get into,  especially many children's books series. If I were a small child, this is  absolutely what I would be looking for, and what I did look for as a child  - I read Asimov's Three Adventurers, Encyclopedia Brown, and other  challenging, brain-based children's fiction that also have the great  adventure and children-getting-the-upper-hand-over-the-adults scenarios  that can make a child feel less helpless, and give one some hope.  Harry  Potter has all that, and has a lot of it.  I can't recommend the series  enough, for adults and for youth.  I am so happy that for once a super  popular book is actually something that is well-written and not an insult  to the intelligence and one's aesthetic sensability - I am so amazed at  this, because so few people seem to ever exhibit any intelligence or  aesthetic sensibility, that the cynic in me would assume that this series  would have failed on the first book for being not-stupid-enough for the  mass audience.  Thank God something clicked in people's heads that they are  willing to explore and challenge themselves a little bit more beyond  insipid love stories and pointless and poorly written action/adventure  books.<br />Three cheers for Harry Potter!	2000-07-13

As this is the fourth book of a seven-book series, I was anticipating something in the way of &quot;Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom&quot; or &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;: a filler with a great act to follow  and a great act to live up to.  Rowling proved me wrong, and I love her for  it!<br />The series follows the travails of a young boy going through seven  years of school, and as all good journeyman books should go, this series is  true to his age during each book.  We see Harry and his friends maturing,  getting social conscience (Hermione &amp; the house-elves), and starting  adolescence.  There are situations showing class-ism (Ron has a problem  with Harry having money &amp; fame), racism (the Death Eaters torture and  bait the muggle camp groundskeepers), and tragic family dynamics (one of  the main sub-plots deals with a son killing his father).  Rowling does not  soften the blow of death and torture.<br />The strong resemblance between  Harry and Voldemort gets fleshed out in this book: their each having a  muggle parent, growing up as orphans, Hogwarts being their first exposure  to magic, they are parseltongues (talk to snakes), their wands being link  to Dumbledore's phoenix.  Where they differ is in the choices they make:  Harry chooses Gryffindor even though the sorting hat thought he would do  well in Slytherin, Harry chooses to let Peter Wormtail go instead of  allowing his murder.<br />Hermione and Ron's characters are well-developed.  Ron's development is interesting in that there is strife in his  relationship with Harry: they fight outright, Ron is extremely jealous of  Harry's fame and wealth, Harry is callous in his treatment of Ron while  they are &quot;enemies&quot;.  Hermione on the other hand plays mediator,  and takes up the cause of the house-elves, who are the servants of the  households and Hogwarts.  She also gets asked to the Ball by the Belgian  Seeker, Ron's idol, thereby proving her attractiveness.  There are signs of  Ron's interest in her which he cannot yet see, but I am sure will get  developed in future books.<br />I could go on forever, but I strongly  recommend, if you have read this review so far, that you read the book!interest in her which he cannot yet see, but I am sure will get  developed in future books.<br />I could go on forever, but I strongly  recommend, if you have read this review so far, that you read the book!	2000-07-13

The exploits of Year Four are by far the most fascinating and dramatic of all of the volumes.  This is an  outstanding book, but I would ask you to be considerate of your child's  reactions to the story as it unfolds.  The emotional toll is heavier than  it has been in the first three volumes.  Year Four marks a dramatic  turning point for Harry Potter.  He discovers the larger wizarding world in  many ways.  As always, there is the delightful and the humorous, but the  dark and sinister side of wizard life is thrust to the fore as well.  More  Weasleys are introduced (Fred and George have even more entertaining  practical jokes and schemes), the Quidditch World Cup is played, Hagrid has  more fascinating magical creatures, the awkwardness of teenage crushes and  boy-girl relationships gets more attention (Hargid even has his moment),  and as always, Ron, Harry, and Hermione have all sorts of escapades.  But the more sinister and reprehensible reach an all time high in Year  Four.  The cruelty that can be exhibited by hateful and prejudiced people  (the followers of Lord Voldemort) is described more fully and vividly.  Excellent examples of the ease with which people (wizards) can subjugate  others (house-elves) or deem them less worthy by arbitrary characteristics  (Mudbloods) are brought out in both new and familiar characters.  Most  powerfully, and this was distressing to me as the father of a VERY YOUNG  Harry Potter fan, the capacity to take human life without remorse is  portrayed twice.  For the first time, a Hogwarts student is murdered.  Having witnessed my son's reaction to the execution of Buckbeak in Year  Three, I am deeply concerned about how he will respond to the death of a  student in Year Four.  Harry Potter is a wonderful fictional hero in a  storybook life filled with tremendous adventures.  His triumph in Year Four  does not come easily nor does it leave you with the same lightness of  spirit you may have experienced with the earlier volumes.  Rowling, a  skilled author,  handles the &quot;traumas&quot; of the story in honorable  and tasteful ways, but they remain emotionally challenging for younger  children.  Let your child enjoy this book (with you?), and be prepared to  talk about it.  This stimulating and sophisticated novel will stay with  your child for a long time.y nor does it leave you with the same lightness of  spirit you may have experienced with the earlier volumes.

In previous books (as i am sure all of you reading this are well aware and have read all four books..ok maybe all three so far..) Harry has only come to face Voldemort when he was very weak and vunerable thus  making Harry's win a struggle but never the less possible.  In this book  Voldemort comes back into play not in quite full strength but strong enough  not to use someone else's body or only be a memory. This book's plot was  needed to continue the suspense of Harry's life (otherwise we'd all  probably get bored reading that there's  always a chance that Voldemort  might return to power).  It's plot was stirring and kept you on your feet  with a little detective work(like in all the books) and of course humor.  Ms. Rowling i feel covers all of the genres in some aspect or another in  all of the Harry Potter series.  She's landed yet another great book.  People ask why everyone likes it so much and i think it's because we wish  this world could actually exist. Who wouldn't love to be someone else with  a little Polyjuice Potion?  Her books bring out imagination that this world  could use a little more of.So thanks Ms. Rowling for waking us all up!  P.S. On page 724 first paragraph there are a set of quotation marks  missing.(on my copy anyway) You may find in your book that Dumbledore's  speech to the students that begins on page 723 doesn't end with quotations!  i'm sure there are many more blunders but this one stood out to me.thanx  for reading this and have fun with the book!	2000-07-12

Everyone in my family (myself, my husband and two sons, 16 and 11) has been eagerly awaiting the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, along with the millions of other adoring fans worldwide. It was worth the  wait! Ms. Rowling has very effectively shown how Harry and his friends are  growing up. Even the vocabulary seems more advanced than in the earlier  stories.  The plot is meticulously crafted; at the beginning of the story,  we encounter He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, who has plans for Harry that are  darker than ever.  The pain in Harry's lightning-bolt scar lets him know  that trouble involving Voldemort is ahead, and as he returns to Hogwarts  for his fourth year, he is thrust, against his will, into a yearlong  competition for the Triwizard Cup which proves to be the greatest test yet  of Harry's maturing powers as a wizard. As in much classic literature, the  struggle between good and evil becomes ever more important in this  installment; I found myself thinking back to Tolkien's The Lord of the  Rings. It is hard to say too much more about the story without revealing  what happens, but once again, Ms. Rowling has invited all of us, no matter  what our ages, into her parallel universe where we laugh, cry, celebrate  and suffer with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, Dumbledore and all the  others.	2000-07-12

He is rescued from this sad situation by the Weasleys who  invite him, rather humorously, to the Quidditch Cup Tournament. Under  duress, his uncle allows him to go. The tournament itself is a success but  activities that follow afterward unleash chaos at the Ministry of Magic.  Meanwhile, at Hogwarts, Harry finds that they must forsake Quidditch, as  the sport of choice, in favor of the Triwizard Cup Tournament.<br />Rowling  clearly shows that Harry and his friends are maturing in their fourth year.  The Triwizard Cup Tournament, especially, releases pent up resentments and  a number of infatuations. Harry shows the development of a moral fiber that  clearly surpasses those around him as he tries to dodge unwanted help and  unwanted press in his struggle as the unprecedented fourth champion in the  Triwizard Cup Tournament.<br />Without giving anything of importance away in  terms of plot, I'd like to say that Rowling is clearly moving on to more  serious matters. The entire atmosphere of the book contains moments of  tension and mounting anxiety that will keep you turning the pages to  discover how the plot thickens and develops. Rowling's incredible talent  keeps the suspense building throughout the book. The Goblet of Fire will  leave you looking forward to Harry Potter V.	2000-07-12

Rowling has written yet another wonderful work about Harry Potter and his time at Hogwarts. I read it all in one day -- I didn't want to stop reading. The book didn't seem excessively long to me. In fact, it seemed almost too short -- not once did I wish that the part I was reading would go faster. I read a LOT of books, and I haven't had that happen since I read \\"The Gripping Hand\\" by Larry Niven.<br />It appears now that the first 3 books were merely prelude to the \\"real\\" story that begins with this book. \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" answers some questions, but asks even more. It's a perfect \\"to be continued....\\" kind of book, because it left me feeling like a complete story was told, but also feeling anxious for more.<br />Harry is 3 years older than he was in the first book, and it shows. He is entering the most harrowing, spine-chilling, frightening period of his life -- he's discovering girls. Also, a very powerful evildoer is trying to kill him. It's almost a toss-up which gives him and his friends the most trouble, at least early on. It's nice to read a series of books about teenagers who actually age and change. Nobody worry, though. Harry's still a really nice boy, even if he is still somewhat of a typical teenager. After all, teenage life is hard enough even without people trying to kill you, and Harry has all the troubles of young adulthood. In short, he's growing up, and just in time, too.<br />The new characters introduced in this book are excellent, and serve to advance (and, in some cases, twist) the plot quite well. I'm looking forward to seeing some of them in future books. I'm also becoming very curious about Snape... but I'm sure we'll find out more in the next book.<br />In conclusion: A great book!

That is the highest compliment I can give to Rowling's fast-paced page turner, which has left her many fans  (including me) screaming for more .  Her brilliant character development in  the first three books have bonded her readers to the times of happiness,  anger, and sheer terror that Ron, Hermione, Harry and many other characters  experience in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  Some authors stick to  the simple plots in children's books that bring at the most short giggles  to the resolution of the petty problems.

Because J.K.Rowling used a lot of imagination (making up all the spells and coming up with the Triwizard Tournament...).  Compared with the first 3, it's much longer, but it has  more suspense and surprises. The book is also easier to read than other  books I have read: The Hobbit, Lord of the Ring - for example. (although  their stories are also exciting). It's SOOOO good, that I couldn't put it  down- so I finished it in 2 days, with time for shopping and swimming (I  had to go with my parents...).  The part when Harry goes to a real  Quidditch match gets really exiting (With the Dark Mark and Death  eaters-the servants of Lord Voldemort). Most of the new characters come  from the other wizarding schools(like Durmstang).  When Dumbledore  anounces that Hogwarts will be participating in the Triwizard Tournament,  the whole school was exited. Who gets to represent Hogwarts? (Only anyone  over 17). But you can guess who, I bet.  The other night 2 ladies were  arguing on TV over wether Harry Potter was a good book or not. One of them  said it was bad because of witchcraft, witches and spells. The other one  said that Harry Potter was a good book for kids to read because it's only  fantasy. I agree with her and, like science fiction,  I can tell it's not  REAL. Harry is not on the bad side- he's against it and he is fighting it.  Harry Potter books are fun to read, and they're really interesting  too!	2000-07-12

After devouring Book 4 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in two days I couldn't be more frustrated. Now I have to wait another year for the next Harry Potter book!  J.K Rowling weaves a tale as few author's can. If the  fact that these books are published as children's fiction is deterring  adults from reading them, they are missing a rich tale of magic,  friendship, adventure, love and the nature of evil. This fourth book shows  an adolescent Harry Potter and as Harry matures, so does the storyline. As  promised by the author, this story is darker than the first three, the  characters are &quot;dating&quot;, and we learn more about Voldemort, our  hero Harry's nemesis, and the nature of his evil power. Without giving  anything away, the last chapters are page-turners and give us a glipse of  what is to come in future stories as Harry matures and continues to fight  evil in his magical world. I, for one, can't wait until Book 5 of the Harry  Potter series is published.  I sure hope J.K. Rowling writes fast!	2000-07-12

Harry is no longer a lost little 11-year-old orphan cringing away from his bullying uncle.  He is now a rapidly maturing, self-assured  14-year-old young man.  He has come face-to-face with horrors most people  only experience in their nightmares.  He has faced them and survived.  This  has matured him.  He bristles at being called &quot;little boy&quot;.  And  yet he still is frighteningly aware of his limitations.<br />Harry and Ron are  starting to notice those strangest and most frightful of all creatures --  girls!  Their friend, Hermione, is on the same voyage of discovery, though  from the opposite direction.  This sailing in uncharted waters provides  some of the most enjoyable sections of the whole novel.<br />The book is a  watershed in atmosphere, too.  Lord Voldemort returns to power, leaving in  shambles the nice tidy magical world we all know from the previous novels.  The process by which he returns provides the darkest and most intense  scenes yet from Rowling's pen.  Parents of young Potter fans may wish to  read the first chapter to determine if their individual child is up to  it.<br />Joanne Rowling is a master at subtle detail.  Her characters leap  from the page fully formed.  The mental images of the scenery are crisp and  clean.  It is only when the book inexplicably loses that touch in spots  that it begins to fail.  Sizable chunks seem devoid of it.  This leaves the  reader with a feeling of incompleteness.  Perhaps 700+ pages were a little  too much for even Rowling's story-telling genius.<br />But these are mere  quibbles.  This is a worthy book to be read and re-read for many years to  come.<br />Enjoy!	2000-07-12

Many stories have striven to catch the minds of its readers, or its listeners for that matter.  From the beginning of time people have made daring attempts at concocting amusing and diverting tales, but J.K. Rowling has spun a most convincing story.  Since the introduction of Harry Potter  to the public, thousands upon thousands, undoubtedly millions, of every  race, age, and religion, have fallen under his spell.  After reading the  fourth, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Finished it in less than three  days; I couldn't put it down!), I have to let it be know that Ms. Rowling  does not disappoint.  As every preceding Potter book starts off, the  newest is no different:  Harry is staying with his insufferable relatives,  the Dursleys.  And as always, he has found a new, more creative and  exciting means of shortening his summer stay with his Aunt, Uncle, and  cousin.  Trouble invariably manages to find Harry, even at his seemingly  secure refuge.  Lord Volde-- oh, goodness, excuse me!--  he-who-must-not-be-named is at his strongest, and Harry is facing greater  risk than ever before.  This is Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts, and he  is now fourteen years old.  So along with life-threatening situations,  almost losing a best friend, meeting new foes, dealing with old ones-  namely Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy, and managing to get most of his  homework done, Potter must also deal with the anguish and misery of being a  teenager.  Take it from me, I'm seventeen years old, and it's hard for me  to believe that J.K. Rowling hasn't just experienced the cruelty of peers  and at the same time, the exciting prospects that come with the whole  &quot;Being a Teen&quot; package.  Fearing that I might give too much  away, I'll leave you with this tidbit:  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll  learn how to pronounce Hermione, but most importantly, you'll want to read  more, and become a better person because of it.	2000-07-12

The first three books were really great, I love all of them, but I think this one's my favorite so far! In the Goblet of Fire, you clearly see the characters maturing, which is great because since it takes so long for each  book to come out, the readers are maturing too, some of them at the same  rate, I expect, so readers have characters they can relate to. The book is  much longer, but Rowling says it's definitely not the longest Harry Potter  book she's going to write. And if you've heard any of the early rumors  about this book- ignore them. Rowling meant the 4th book to be a turning  point in the series, where the mood starts to get a bit more exciting, and  at the same time more serious. I would say that the other books can be read  by, or read to, 2nd graders- 2nd century-ers. But this one I would move up  to 4th graders. As usual, there is a sense of mystery in the book and a  huge twist in plot at the climax. On the side and in case you haven't  heard, the Warner Brother's movie based on &quot;Harry Potter and the  Sorceror's Stone&quot; is scheduled to come out in November, 2001. The cast  will be all British, and Rowling has a say in the production (but she  trusts them to do a good job).	2000-07-12

In the fourth installment of the Harry Potter series (which I have enjoyed immensely!) Potter has again travelled to the famed Hogwarths school of magic.  But this is a new Potter.  Rowlings seems to be comfortable with  her bewitchingly famous creation, comfortable enough to let us see more  through Potter's eyes.  At 753 pages it is a whopper of a story with an  outstanding climax and so many juicy leads that the next three books should  be a snap. There is a greater sense of emotional depth, danger, surprise  and conflict in this novel than ever before.  It is fun to witness Harry,  Ron and Hermione growing up together, meeting challenges and limitations  with the same trademark elan that has made them famous and so lovable.  Rowling is a master storyteller and she has built a smashingly riveting  story from the scaffold of her previously three books. My only regret is  the two days of my life that I cannot remember very clearly because I was  riveted to this book.  While I am sad that I have finished, I must work on  other things!  Read it and you will see what I mean.	2000-07-12

In her fourth installment of the Harry Potter series, author J.K. Rowling, pens another hit.  I am sure that younger readers will be especially thrilled at the introduction of new characters as well as the secrets we  learn about many of our old favorites. This book is every bit as  captivating as the first three.  I especially like the fact that Rowling  did not just do a &quot;hum-drum&quot; repeat of some of the events in the  first three books, but cooked up an entirely different angle for this  story.  She even took one of the main events of the first three books out  and replaced it with something very interesting---but you'll have to read  for yourself to find out what it is!  This is an excellent family book.  Adults and children alike will be entertained by the imaginative world that  they are transported to when they read---the magical world, that is, of  Harry Potter.;	2000-07-12

This year Harry's adventure started on a different track. He has a horrible nightmare only to be comforted by the thought that he would be away from the Dursley's in a few short weeks. That is sped up by a generous invite by the Weasley's to go with them to the Quidditch World Cup. After  spending the rest of the summer with the Weasley's, the gang finally went  back to Hogwarts. They arrive at school to find out something has changed  this year. They anxiously wait to find out who the new Defense Against the  Dark Arts teacher will be, and what the BIG SURPRISE is.<br />I am a few  chapters from the finish, and I have only owned it for a few short days.  The Goblet of Fire is too good to put down.

My sister and I agree that the Harry Potter series keeps getting better as the series progresses.  The fourth book is very good and fast paced, yet again one that you just can't put down.  The fourth book is a little more  serious and scary but considering that the main villian in the series,  Voldemort, is evil and supposed to be building his strength again for the  climactic seventh book it should be expected to get a little more serious.  Though the fourth book isn't quite as light-hearted as the first three  books there are still plenty of funny scenes involving the many  difficulties of being a teenager in school.  The fourth Harry Potter book  keeps your attention from the suspenseful first chapter to the suprising  end.  As Harry matures so does the plot line of the series and J.K.  Rowling's writing.  The only thing I have the complain about is that the  fourth book was so good waiting another year for the next book is going to  be hard.	2000-07-12

After hearing the news that Harry Potter 4 weighed in at an unbelievable 750 pages, I hope you can forgive me for thinking that perhaps, just perhaps, JK Rowling could have used an editor.  &quot;What was she  thinking,&quot; I found myself asking as I hefted the book.<br />Well, I've  lost two night's sleep completing the thing, because I could barely bring  myself to put it down.  She needed every one of those pages to tell a  gripping story that I adored.  If anything, this book is better than the  first three:  richer, darker, cleverer. I would quibble somewhat with the  &quot;James Bond villain disease&quot; that seems to pervade the evildoers  in these books (&quot;here, before I kill you, let me explain my nefarious  plot&quot;), but Rowling manages to tie together something like 5 or 6  distinct plot lines in an explosive conclusion while only resorting to this  device essentially once.<br />I love the fact that Harry, Ron, and Hermione  are growing up.  There are several tender and awkward moments as they come  to terms with the fact that Hermione is a girl -- something that was never  important before except in the context of who was allowed in which  bathroom.<br />It is amusing to see several characters providing  exaggerated  phonetic pronounciation hints to &quot;Hermione&quot; -- I wonder if this  is the most common question Rowling gets from the American audience?	2000-07-12

After book 3, I was hoping that the next in the Harry Potter series would re-invigorate the series. While &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was a good book, it seemed that there was a definite formula developing that was  making Harry's adventures less exciting. Well, I'm happy to say that  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; lived up to my  expectations! Even the book cover lets you know that J.K. Rowling is going  to shake things up at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. I  won't reveal too many details, but in this one Harry faces his biggest  challenge(s) yet! While the book is not overtly scary I guess parents  should be warned that it is, so far at least, the darkest of the series -  and Harry is forced to face some pretty grim situations and upsetting  consequences. But I don't think it's anything a kid couldn't handle,  especially since the lessons Harry learns are ones that we all must face  sooner or later. As with the rest of the series, I would highly reccomend  that parents read this book out loud to their children. Harry's adventures  are one of those  rare feats that truly can involve all age groups equally.  And, as someone who very fondly remembers the nights when my father used to  read to my sisters and I, I can assure you that this is exactly the sort of  thing that we would have loved to have shared.	2000-07-12

It supplies you with a great deal of magical yet  dangerous creatures, evil wizards, great friends, dangerous life  threatening  tasks, and an abundant amount of wonderful writing.

Providing the usuall intrigue, and adventure.  This is in fact exactly what drops my rating of this book.  I can't honestly say that i have ever  disliked reading one of Rowling's works, but to me they seem to have a deep  seated pattern about them.  I think that she tried to break things up a bit  with a few clever plot twists (won't mention them here, you'll have to read  for yourself), however many times i knew exactly what was going to happen  in the story.  Other then what i mentioned no big complaints.  And i guess  the predictability couldn't be avoided really, since it would be hard to  break up the normal routine of Harry's school year much without completly  ruining the continuity of the story.  I'm sure that as Harry grows up the  books will begin to do like wise, becoming less predictable as well.  Speaking of which, the books have a certain trend to grow exponentialy.  From 309 to 341 to 439 to 743 pages from each book to the next.  I'm hoping  that book five doesn't reach into the thousands.

He wants to be a  normal, fourteen-year-old wizard.  Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not  normal--even by wizarding standards.  And in this case, different can be  deadly.<br />From the mysterious beginning, to the fast-paced middle, to the  hanging end, this book is every bit as good and has as many twists and  revelations as the first three.  In fact, it only leaves you wanting one  thing:  the fifth one right at hand to start the second you finish this  one.	2000-07-12

It is also the longest of the books to date, the  American hardcover coming to about 750 pages. This isn't the only  difference, though, since Harry has grown up, and with him, the  series.<br />Where one and two were light-hearted, funny, and energetic,  Prisoner of Azkaban (Book 3) was called the darkest of the books. Well, I  don't think that GoF is as dark as PoA, but it is much bloodier and mature.  Death is far more rampant in its pages than in any of the previous  volumes.<br />Of course, this does not mean that GoF is any worse than the  first three. Personally, I liked it better. Despite its length, it seemed  less complete than 1 - 3, and set up the story for what the remaining books  will probably be dealing with. It was a lot like Star Wars: the Empire  Strikes Back in that it set up only half of the full story. (Of course,  most Star Wars fans will tell you ESB was the best of the movies.) This in  no way detracts from the storytelling. It just hits you with the  realization that the next book is many months away.<br />I don't mean to make  it sound as if this is a horrible, gruesome book. Yes, it is more  pessimistic than the others, but it has its fair share of humor and fun,  and it is overall optimistic in tone. It was inevitable that Harry grow up,  but his doing so requires that we grow up with him.<br />Don't be afraid, go  get this book as soon as you can. Rowling has not disappointed fans with  GoF.<br />Just remember that innocence can't last forever, least of all for  the boy whose greatest enemy is the dreaded &quot;You-Know-Who.&quot;	2000-07-12

I am amazed at the strength these particular childrens  books have and was caught clambering for a copy of the latest one knocking  little children out of the way in the process. Harry as a character really  emerges from the pages in this latest book and I could not stop reading  this book until I had finished it.  This book works on all sorts of levels  despite some of the reviews I have read and after introducing one of my  friends to the world of Harry Potter she too was amazed at the amount of  depth J K Rowling has weaved into each page. (She is actually going to  study English Literature at Cambridge next year which really shows how  brilliant a creation Harry Potter is.)  I wish books had been this well  written when i was 11.

More than any of the others in the series, _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ sets the framework for the series' plot and puts the developments of the other three books into  perspective.<br />Besides all that, the book is great.  J. K. Rowling's style  seems more confident than ever, and the 700+ pages are just an answer to  &quot;I wish it didn't end so soon!&quot;  Despite its length, the story  doesn't drag, and this is especially because it elaborates so neatly on  some of the less conspicuous details in the preceding books.  Suddenly  house elves (remember Dobby?) take on a huge importance;  Scabbers gets  even more sinister;  and the story of Tom Riddle haunts Harry once again.  Plus, we even get some hints into the basis for Voldemort's maniacal  tendencies (inferiority complex due to paternal neglect?  Yearning for  unreturned parental love?  Who knows!)  Rowling has clearly thought this  series out, and Book Four builds seamlessly on everything she's told us  previously.  Rather than getting bored of the whole Harry Potter craze, you  begin to see why seven books are really needed -- in fact, with Voldemort's  return to power in this volume, you wonder how the rest of the story could  possibly fit into the remaining three books.<br />I suppose the only  complaints I have about this book are that the love angle is somewhat  clunky in its treatment, and that, at the end of the book, you do wonder  why the insidious insider at Hogwarts had to go to _all_ that effort just  to get Harry.  But hey.  The descriptions of Rita Skeeter, the overzealous  news reporter who can turn an &quot;Er...&quot; into a confession of one's  innermost (and least-existing) secrets, are hilarious.  The scenes that  feature Voldemort are truly scary.  Harry Potter's path for the next three  years is much more clearly defined now.  And the length was perfect for me  :)	2000-07-12

Those that  claim that the book is darker need to look at the facts as they stand:  Harry's parents are dead. Many wizards did not survive Voldemort's first  reign. There are plenty who would be happy to see the dark days return.  None of those is a bright happy thing. The point is that J.K Rowling has  given us a character that uses his abilities and morals for good, not evil,  despite the &quot;darkness&quot; around him.

They become more engrossing and mesmerising and you keep wanting to know more and more about Harry Potter and his gang of  friends.<br />I believe the true strength of this series is in how well JK  Rowling is aging her characters.  We started seeing them at age 11 and now  they are age 14 and with each book you feel that they are another year  older and you can see their newfound maturaty and insecurities coming out  of them and it is just masterful.  So often in series what gets dull is  that the main character NEVER changes, but here, you are watching Harry  grow up and you truly feel like you are right there with him.<br />The other  strength of these books is that they aren't made up of cookie cutter plots,  each time you think you know who the bad guy is and how Harry and his  friends will face the dangers and you end up shocked at how wrong you were  about everything.<br />After I closed the back cover, I couldn't help but  thinking &quot;what a shame it is that there will be only 3 more books in  this series&quot;, JK Rowling has once again cast her spell over me and you  can bet that when book 5 gets released, FedEx will once again be making  that special delivery to my doorstep the day of the release.<br />If you  haven't already started with these books, regardless of who you are, you  will love them.  This book is loved by all, young and old, because the  messages that come through them are ageless.  Buy them all and cherish this  treasure.  If you haven't read this one, buy it, I promise you'll only be  left wanting for more.<br />Thank you JK Rowling for giving the world this  gift.	2000-07-12

I won't go into the plot too much, since I hate it when people spoil books  for those who haven't read them yet.  But I must say that the reason I love  this series so much, is that while the world that Harry and his friends  inhabit is magical, the people are REAL.  The reason that this book is  scarier, sadder and more complicated, is because the characters are growing  older, and that's what happens when you grow older:  you realize how much  more complicated life gets, and how, when it comes to a person's character,  there are an awful lot of shades of grey, rather than just black and white.  Nothing and no one is as clear-cut as it first appeared, and never will be  again.	2000-07-12

What was the term that  they used in the book description for this? &quot;Pivotal&quot; or  something?  This is what I interpeted that as: that, for one, the books  would be &quot;pivoting&quot; in their themes.  You know; like the first  three books were - for the most part, or until they reached the end -  lighthearted with a  hint of the &quot;dark side&quot; popping up every now  and then.  But now that Voldemort's back, things are going to be getting  darker and darker and darker...  Rowling was definitly right when she warned that this  book would be a lot darker than the others.<br />  Which brings up another  point.  Is Rowling really sure that she writes for children?  I mean, you  have all of this &quot;dark side&quot; stuff going on, which is enough to  terrorize most little kids.

I really enjoyed the tournament itself and enjoyed  all the twists and turns that occur at the end.  The Ministry politics were  also an interesting aspect of this book.  It is interesting to see that top  Ministry officials and Hogwarts staff do not agree on many issues.  This  book also dealt with some of the darker aspects of the series and had some  moments that will be scary for young children.  Parents might want to read  the book themselves first and decided what chapters or parts their children  should read.

Don't be put off by this book's length!  The newest Harry Potter book is fantastic, altough its plot remain similar to the last three installments.  The first chapter, while dark and menacing, is excellent.  The following  100 pages, however, are rather dull and may leave the reader regretting  their purchase.  Thankfully, the plot picks up quickly and soon you can't  put it down.  New additions like the Yule Ball and the Triwizard  Tournament keep things interesting, but I couldn't help noticing how alike  the outlines of the series' books are.  The pattern for every plot goes  like this: Harry gets rescued from his uncle's house by Ron, Harry goes to  Hogwarts, Harry meets new Dark Arts teacher, Harry fights in climax, Harry  discovers DA teacher's mysterious secret, Harry goes home.  This isn't  nessecarily a bad thing, but it could get tiresome by the next book.  Nevertheless, if you liked the last books, or haven't read any of them, you  won't want to miss this.  J.K. Rowling's references to everyday life such  as her thoughts against racism and the troubles of the poor add to the  storyline.  Anyone who takes the time to read through its 750-plus pages  will find themselves satisfied (and surprised!) upon finishing it.

The Harry Potter books are turning out to be a sort of a milestone in children's books.  They're &quot;wonderful&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, and &quot;beautiful&quot;.  I agree with this sort of description, however, it  is important to point that this series of books is an epitome and therefore  a generic example of any novel about magic.<br />How is it generic if it  seems so original?<br />J.K. Rowling is a master at combining what every good  book needs: the old war between the good and evil, lots of magic tricks,  and a likeable main character (for we cannot not like Harry because he's an  orphan, right?).<br />The books contain all the ingredients any book about a  school of magic should have: magical creatures, wise and evil wizards,  strange spells, and weird professors.  On the other hand, it is not  difficult to find these in other books for children.  Yet the fame of Harry  Potter lives on - is it because we have forgotten to venture into the land  of books and we only pick what is most popular?  Nobody seems to remember  Roal Dahl or J.R.R. Tolkien - the Harry Potter books are much easier to  obtain (especially with all the discounts on them).<br />Ok.  I don't want to  seem that I am against the Harry Potter books - they are pretty and  well-written.  It is nice to see little six-year-olds carrying the giant  seven hundred page long books with them.<br />But Harry Potter books is not  all there is - try something else for a change, people, away with the cult  of Harry Potter :)<br />As for the book number four.<br />The Goblet of Fire is  well written although it seems a bit rushed.  It is almost as if J.K.  Rowling meant to write it as a longer book and had to stop herself to make  it fit something.<br />Also, it is much easier to expect who the guilty party  is going to be.  The previous books would have three kinds of suspects:  a.  the obviously guilty ones, b. the obviously innocent, and c. characters who  were not suspects at all.<br /><br />In the previous books, it was the characters  who were beyond suspicion who turned out to be guilty.  Book #4 seems to be  a slip, for it does not hold us on the same lever of excitement, for we  easily predict who is trying to kill Harry Potter this time (simply by  choosing b, not c).<br />Overall, I give the book 4 stars, not 5.  This book  does not stand as high as the previous ones, yet, I still highly recommend  it.previous books, it was the characters  who were beyond suspicion who turned out to be guilty.

I am not in the least bit ashamed to admit that I read Harry Potter. About a year ago I finished reading J.R.R. Tolkein's  celebrated &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. When I put it down I  remember thinking &quot;Never again will such a masterpiece of fantasy be  written...&quot; But J.K. Rowling has since proven me wrong. In her first  three books, she captured all the aspects of great fantasy: the wonderful  world of witchcraft and wizardry, the strange and magical creatures, the  dark and forbidding evil wizards, and their jovial and somewhat humorous  counterparts. In her brilliance, Rowling wrapped all of this around things  kids everywhere can relate to, namely school, sports, and just growing up.  This fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, is no exception.  There is, however, no Hogwarts Quidditch Cup. It has been replaced (for one  year) by the Triwizard Tournament, an International competition of historic  proportions. The final chapter, ironically called &quot;The Beginning&quot;  will leave readers tapping their feet in anticipation of book five.	2000-07-12

Although usually the word &quot;sequel&quot; prepares you to lower your expectations, this fourth installment in the Harry Potter series packs even more excitement, quirky characters, and tightly plotted events than the  previous three books.  Much attention has been paid to its length (734  pages and four pounds), but it is a supremely satisfying read.  You will  want to savor every page.  Although most of the major plot elements of this  volume are resolved by the end, the author hints at some of the challenges  which lie ahead for our hero, paving the way for more excitement in volume  five.  Film critic Roger Ebert writes that the reason the &quot;Star  Wars&quot; series is so successful is that its creator George Lucas pays  careful attention to even the minutest detail, populating even the corners  of the frame with interesting characters.  In much the same way, J. K.  Rowling packs the Harry Potter books with so much detail that the world of  witches and wizards comes alive.  In &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, this  enchanting world is revealed in greater scope, with more of the action  taking place in the wider world outside the Hogwarts School.  We learn for  the first time of the existence of other schools of wizardry, and we meet  characters from other cultures.  Although so many things about the  wizarding world are different, at the same time we can really identify with  the thoughts and feelings of these characters:  the awkwardness of  adolescence, the loneliness of an orphaned boy and the excitement of first  love.  Rowling has written a book to delight Harry Potter fans everywhere.  My question is, how long until she produces volume 5?	2000-07-12

This book totally blew me away!  For once, something came outthat was worth all the hype about it. I have really enjoyed the HarryPotter series previously, as have my husband and sons, and I expected to enjoy this book.  I did not expect to be enraptured by a book that made me laugh, cry, do both at the same time, bite my nails, scream in horror and smile with delight.  I am so glad I was mistaken. When I realized how long this book is (750+ pages) I was sure that there were going to be some slow moments.  NOT TRUE!  This book starts off running and keeps you enthralled until you reach the last page begging for more.  ...I would definitely recommend that anyone who wants to read this start with Book 1 and read the Harry Potter books in order. I am also unsure if the younger children who have enjoyed the series up until now will appreciate the darker turns in Goblet of Fire.  If you are a parent of a child from age 7-10 who is a Harry Potter fan, make sure you discuss the more frightening aspects of the book with you child.  I can't say enough good things about this book, but I don't want to give any of the surprises away.  Let's just say there are lots of surprises, some of them frightening and some of them hilarious.  JK Rowling has a way of interjecting humor in even the most tense of scenes. I really also enjoyed seeing the return of a number of characters whom I thought would not show up again. Read this book.  You won't regret it.	2000-07-12

I did not read the first until later in its publication, but I could not wait for the second, third and fourth. However long the wait for Harry Potter and the  Goblet of Fire was, it has proven to be worth-while. The fourth Harry  Potter book does not let down readers, but only encourages them to further  involve themselves in the plot. For a teenage reader, such as myself, the  way J.K. Rowling addresses Harry's aging is a truthful and overwhelmingly  accurate account. Harry is nothing more than a nervous teenage boy when he  needs to ask Cho to the dance, simply showing again that Harry is only  human when it comes to some matters. Harry Potter and his fourth adventure  manages to captivate readers into wanting nothing more than to read more  and more tales of this boy's life. I loved the story spun in Harry Potter  and the Goblet of Fire, and poured though the 734 page book in several  hours.  Harry Potter is a universal story in which a boy lives. His life  may be far from what we know as ordinary, but a life which I, for one,  would love to experience.	2000-07-12

As most readers know, sequels are rarely as good as the original.  For a while it seemed as if J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series was the exception to this rule - with Books Two and Three every bit as good and, perhaps,  even better than the first.  Unfortunately, Rowlings has struck out with  Book Four.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire does not live up to its  predecessors.  Much of the charm of the first three books in this series  came from the tightly drawn, fast moving plots, the compelling characters  and the delightful descriptions of the magical world.  Unfortunately,  several of these are lacking in Book Four.  First, the book is way too  long.  Many of the 700 plus pages are taken up with subplots that do not  add to the main story line and could have been easily cut with no apparent  loss - such as the tale of the Weasley twins' failed bet.  Where was the  editor?  Furthermore, the story itself seems contrived.  Once a reader  reaches the denounement and has all the pieces of the puzzle, he can't help  but start wondering why the bad guys went to all the trouble they did with  the Triwizards Competition?  After all, once the Death Eater infilitrated  Hogwarts, he had ample opportunity to set his trap a lot earlier in the  school year and in a much simpler fashion.  Looked at in this light, the  complicated plotline seems like a Rube Goldberg contraption.  Another  problem with the book is that the character of Harry seems flat, lacking  the psychological depth that he had in the prior books.  A large part of  what made them so interesting was Harry's complexity.  His search for his  roots, his need to know his parents and understand who he is explains many  of Harry's actions in the first three books.  None of this shows up in Book  Four nor does Rowling replace it with anything.  Indeed, she seems  completely uninterested in dealing with the psychological complexities of  Harry's relationships.  For example, she completely fails to mine the  potentially rich opportunity she had to show Harry wrestling with feelings  of jealousy before deciding to aid the other Hogwarts' champion.  The  result of not doing so is a much less interesting and compelling hero.  Finally, the tone of the book is too often &quot;preachy&quot;.  Much of  the action appears to exist primarily for the purpose of teaching moral  lessons.  While the messages she seek to impart are praiseworthy, the way  in which Rowlings is impelled to point them out in capital letters detracts  from the quality of the book.  Rather than simply letting the actions of  the characters illustrate the difference between good and evil, she  constantly  highlights the point by having someone give an awkward sounding  moral lecture.  Witness Hermione's denunciations of elfin slavery or  Hagrid's speech on judging a person by what they do rather than their  lineage.  Each time I got to one of these sections, I couldn't help  contrasting it with the more enjoyable (and less wordy) way that another  famous children's author, Dr. Seuss, made many of the same points in such  books as Yertle the Turtle and The Sneetches.  Despite all my issues with  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I have to admit that I still enjoyed  reading it.  Rowling did as good a job as ever in making the magical world  of Hogwart seem to come alive physically.  The problem is that, by this  point in the series, I am so familiar with the wonders of talking  portraits, owl mailmen and plates that magically fill up with food, that  they just aren't enough to carry the book by themselves.lly rich opportunity she had to show Harry wrestling with feelings  of jealousy before deciding to aid the other Hogwarts' champion.

Real Life	As many have said, Rowling's ongoing plots for Harry Potter have just grown better, especially in this fourth book. Right from the beginning, the reader is thrown into a state of suspence and intrigue as Voldemort's dark  plans are highlighted early in the novel. There is no lack of creativity on  the author's part as Harry experiences the dangers and challenges of the  Triwizard Tournament, the mysteriousness around Mr. Crouch, and sneaky Rita  Skeeter. Yet what astounds me the most is how much symbollism and many  metaphores are incorporated throughout the book. Rowling achieves the goal  of making her characters seem real and their situations very similar to the  Muggles' (us). We are suddenly not the outsiders reading in, but the  Hermiones that stand up for rights of the elves, the Hagrids that are  sometimes put down because of being different, and many of the various  passions and concerns that brew as bubbly as a mixture of magic potion.	2000-07-12

These two words can mean so much to the people that read the books.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was everything expected of it: action, adventure, and heart-stopping suspense.  And yes it's true; a  friend of Harry's does die.<br /> What happens is someone slips Harry's name  into the Goblet of Fire to enter him in the Triwizard Tournament, a highly  dangerous competition where there is a possibility of death.  No doubt is  there that someone is working for Voldemort to see that Harry dies in the  tournament.  Two other students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, other  wizarding schools, and Cedric Diggory are chosen to compete.  There are 3  tasks they most complete to become winners.<br /> Strange things are  happening: Death Eaters (Voldemort's supporters) appear at the Quidditch  World Cup, Harry's name is entered in the Goblet, some people go missing,  and Harry's scar starts hurting.<br /> Then, at the very end of the last  task, Harry finds himself, as well as a friend, in a situation of  considerable danger...<br /> (I won't give away the ending)<br /> There are some  things I can guarantee: Sirius Black will be apart of the book.  Harry  won't have a girlfriend (Cho).  Hagrid's life story will be revealed.  Harry will show such strong bravery unlike any before.  And here's an  interesting fact: sworn enemies Severus Snape and Sirius black will have a  truce.  Another important tidbit: Voldemort will have risen, and Minister  of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, will not believe he has, so he and Dumbledore go  their separate ways.<br /> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the thickest  yet, will definitely enchant readers everywhere.	2000-07-12

That's rare: not many kids  books please adults (the Hobbit and Watership Down are the two I'm thinking  of).<br />The series is a little bit dark, though--it reminds me of Roald Dahl  (James and the Giant Peach, etc.).

I also would have  preffered a longer world cup but the bok was long enough as it was. It was  suspensfull enough that I that I read the whole thing in 16 hours or so. (I  finished at about 3:30 in the morning.) Well anyway it was very good and I  would reccomened it to most people.

But the evil is not only  supernatural; it's also clearly becoming identified with the  attitudes of  those who believe that Muggles are a corrupting force and an abomination in  the wizarding world. And although it's done with some humor, there's an  interesting subplot about house elves and slavery (remember Dobby?) It also  develops the characters further, some unexpectedly; for example, Albus  Dumbledore, Severus Snape and even Hagrid. And though one of the characters  dies (I'm not going to spoil it by telling), Rowling's humor remains  intact. The conflicts between Harry and Ron, and Ron and Hermione, are  particularly well executed; and the reader never forgets that the three  main young characters are kids (and ones now coping with puberty), even if  they can perform magic.  Rowling includes the blind alleys and red herrings  she excels at creating, which provide their usual suspense. As Rowling has  said, this is the pivotal book, and she's pulled it off again.	2000-07-12

The first three books were fun.  This one is even better.  It's  more complex. Harry and his schoolmates are a little older, and much more  mature than when we first met them.  The situations that they face are more  complicated, and they have more autonomy to make decisions and take  responsibility for the consequences of their choices and behavior. For the  first time, the main characters begin to consider their careers in the  wizarding world. &quot;Shall I use my training to become an Auror, or  .....?&quot;  If the reader has read all three previous books, the  characters are old friends.  As friendships develop we learn more about our  friends, we understand more, and we care a great deal more.  In this book  we deepen our friendships with Harry, ron and Hermione.  We accept their  character qualities, both strengths and weaknesses, and sincerely wish them  well on their journey through this stage of their lives.  The characters  are drawn with much more detail than the earlier, younger books.  The plot  action is very intricate and yes, I will need to re-read this book next  week to savor the details.  The setting is magnificent.  How wizards with  great abilities co-exist in a world with mere muggles is the stuff of  enchantment. Suspending disbelief enough to accept portkeys, The World  Quidditch Cup championship game, and the magical curriculum at Hogwarts is  worth reading late into the night, and being sleepy at work the next  morning.  However, my young patients are impressed that I can discuss Harry  Potter with them in detail. I only wish I had the wisdom of Professor  Dumbledore.	2000-07-12

I did miss  the Quidditch matches, but as always the reader is wowed by Harry's flying  ability in his faceoff against the dragon.  Harry also showed a lot of  integrity during task two and it was nice to see that the thing he would  miss the most is a person who means a lot to him, rather than a posession.   As always, Harry trimuphs over the most difficult of tasks, and ends up in  the hospital wing, but it wouldn't be a normal year at Hogwarts for him if  he didn't.

Even though I am long past my formative years I have been waiting impatiently for the fourth Harry Potter book since I finished The Prisoner of Azkaban. It seems like every book got better that the book before and I  reread the first three several times as I waited for Goblet of Fire's  release date.<br />Goblet of Fire is much longer than its predecessors. It  also unfolds much more slowly. Harry doesn't even get to Hogwart's until  the 11th chapter. It is also a bit darker than the previous three books and  the ending doesn't end as tidily as they did.<br />All that being said, this  is a really wonderful book. You can tell that Joanne Rowling doesn't have  &quot;a formula&quot;. She has a story to tell and stays true to that story  even though telling it properly requires a change of pace from the previous  novels. This book is still as gripping as are all the Harry Potter books  (judging by the fact that I read all 636 pages in 2 days). This is also a  novel that you can read and reread because there are so many clues that  every time you read you find things you missed the first time around. To me  that is the sign of a truly great novel.<br />If you haven't read Harry Potter  yet you really need to get all four books...pitch a tent away from the  hubbub of daily life and immerse yourself in the magical world of Harry,  Ron, Hermione (they finally tell you how to pronounce her name in this  book) and the rest of the characters at Hogwart's.

I was eagerly anticipating reading more of Harry's adventures on the Quidditch field and scrapes with danger as he continued his studies as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry.  However, I was not disappointed to find other players on the  Quidditch field in the book of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br />My  level of uneasiness grew as J.K.Rowling developed layer upon layer of  suspenseful episodes throughout Harry's fourth year.  I was not prepared  for the twist of events that unfurled as Harry met students from other  wizardry schools and events confirmed his suspicions of familiar  acquaintances.  The tempo of encounters with peril and you-know-who varied  just enough to keep me off guard.  I remain in awe of J.K. Rowling's  creative ability to draw readers into the magical world at Hogwarts.<br />Many  families have enjoyed previous Harry Potter books to read aloud together.  J.K. Rowling's art cleverly creates stressful environments in The Goblet of  Fire that may be too intense for some young readers.  My family was  thrilled to read a book with suspense, torture, mystery, and death, without  the prolonged gore and gristly details geared toward the older reader.  Parents will be sensitive to their own children's emotional development and  recognize that this book is for reading aloud after the little ones have  gone to bed.	2000-07-11

What has truly astounded me about this series is that, as the characters mature, so do the plots.  With this book, our heroes start to turn into teenagers, complete with moodiness, puppy love, and concern about what their peers actually think of them.  Likewise, their awareness of the world  around them continues to increase, and what appeared to be a simple,  childish world of magic in the first book becomes a more sophisticated,  intriguing place.  I hope that this style of story telling will continue  with the next three books- I think it is an excellent way to develop a  series covering several years from a character's life, and will appeal to  younger readers, who are growing up even as the characters are.  I'm sure  the backlash is already rising against this book, just because it has  already been so successful.  Ignore that.  Read it.  Then tell all the  Muggles to jump in a lake.	2000-07-11

How is this possible for a 734-page book?  We made some ground rules and stuck to them (you can't take the book away from someone  until they've finished a chapter, you can't keep the book from someone if  you're not reading it yourself, no spoilers, no taking the book out of the  house).<br />The short review:  this is the best one yet.  Rowling's  imagination is inexhaustible, the characters grow and change in unexpected  but absolutely right ways, and the struggle between good and evil is more  gripping than ever.<br />Although I'll post a longer review later, I'll get to  the most important point now.  The only plausible reason I have ever seen  for not buying the Harry Potter books is a worry by some Christians that  the emphasis on magic and witchcraft is somehow unhealthy.<br />All I can  say is that those books are spiritually in the right place -- it is VERY  clear what the difference is between good and evil and which side we should  be fighting on, even at the cost of great pain, sacrifice, and death.<br />The latest book is the best yet in this respect -- the villains are much  more openly evil, and yet the reader understands why they choose that path  [hint: power and pride], while learning both the ultimate soul-destroying  horror of it and the necessity of fighting it at ALL times (every choice  you ever make being potentially decisive).	2000-07-11

As an adult, I've enjoyed reading these as much as any child. Filled with imagination, insight, and yes, riveting plot twists, the Harry Potter series is destined to be a  classic. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry begins to mature  into adulthood and learn the true meanings of magic, friendship, and fear.  In his fourth year, Harry encounters characters whose actions in the past  have affected him, his friends, and his future. In this book,  Rowling  deepens Harry's story revealing poignant and sometimes tragic aspects of  minor characters in a way that humanizes what until now have been  relatively flat characters.  Without spoiling the read, it is safe to say  that Harry is selected to test his mettle as a wizard in a unique and  challenging contest. Behind the scenes, however, lurks an all too familiar  evil that is out to kill Harry and do much worse. Parents will be pleased  that this book treats the horrific and tragic happenings in a way that is  sensitive and thought provoking. As Rowling's child audience matures, so  Harry has grown and experienced life in such a way as to fulfill one of the  goals of all literature--to inform and entertain.	2000-07-11

Ms Rowling  did not disappoint!  This book was as thrilling and complex as book 3.  It's exciting to keep finding out more about the wizarding world through  Harry's eyes.  This book answers alot of questions about Harry's past but  asks alot more as well.  The adults know alot more about Harry's family  then they are telling him.  I guess we will have to wait for future books  to answer those questions.<br />In the meantime Ms. Rowling again adds vivid  details to this world, and leaves the reader wanting to know when Book 5  will be published.

More information and plot layers are  added to the struggle between good &amp; evil.

The new book is actually a  slightly easier read than the others, generally maintains a compelling  plot, and has good development of the existing characters, with the  exception of Albus Dumbledore.  My major complaint is that the omniscient  and ever-kindly Dumbledore is pushed too far in this one, especially in  regard to his relationship with Hagrid.  I could do with a few fewer  &quot;Great man, Dumbledore ...&quot;, or at least a flaw or two.

It's too bad that this review thing will only let you choose 5 as the highest because it deserves at least a 10. This book was the best out of the four so far but it's length made it a little harder to follow. I have  read books much longer than this one but everything in this book seemed  kind of hurried compared to the previous three. The events and new  characters in it are just as original and creatively thought up as much of  the others from the three previous books. I was afraid that Rowling might  have lost a little bit of her creativity or something but I assure you,  this one captured me and pulled me into it just like the other ones. The  whole plot and story line are amazing and you'd never be able to guess what  happens. I read the book in less than two days simply because I couldn't  put it down. I was forced to keep reading and I even delayed meals to  squeeze in some more reading. The entire book was thoroughly enjoyed and it  was better than I expected it to be. Many unexpected turns in the book made  it more enjoyable. Although this book was a little bit darker and more  mysterious than the first and third ones, I still think it had the most  involved and complicated plot which made it better than the others. I am  very glad that I went to the bookstore at 12 o'clock on July 8th to get my  book. It was extremely good and completely worth reading. I hope, and I  certainly think, that everyone will agree when I say that J.K. Rowling has  caught the snitch again with another awesome Harry Potter tale.	2000-07-11

Rowling's latest book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, delivers exactly what we've come to expect from the well-known Harry Potter series. Harry, Ron,  and Hermione are back again, along with all the people you've come to know  and love (or possibly hate) from the first three books.  An excellent  story for all ages, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is next to  impossible to put down once you've begun reading it.  With Voldemort  lurking yet again, Harry is thrown into a dangerous inter-academy wizarding  competition he didn't enter.  In addition to his schoolwork, Harry must  contend with a new threat to his person, and animosity coming from more  than the Slytherins, as he yet again risks his life for the sake of his  friends and school.  In addition to engrossing, it's also certainly not  lacking in either the trademark humor which is plentiful in the first three  books, or anything else we've come to expect from the series.  Harry Potter  IV is every bit as good as the others, and more!  In short, this book is a  wonderful addition to the series, and a must-have for your library, no  matter how old you are.	2000-07-11

Ms. Rowling has done it again and made her latest book better than the last one, which was certainly hard to do.  The humor that Rowling has mastered in the other books is still present, but the series does seem to  be turning to a more serious side at times.  The serious side only adds to  the depth of the books though and I definately recommed this book.  Some  parents of younger fans should be warned that the book definately shows how  evil Voldemort can be and should maybe either read the last six or seven  chapters out loud to their children or at least be close by.  This book is  definately worth buying though, I hope everyone has fun with reading it.	2000-07-11

I was absolutely consumed with it this weekend.  Fast paced and intense! The initial episode at the Riddle House moved quickly, setting the stage for Lord Voldemort to start his evil deeds. (In the other books he was much slower to arrive.)  After all, he IS the quintessential villian! The World Cup Quidditch Match  left me wondering who the death eaters might be. Malfoy certainly was  arrogant, as usual. Best of all, I really like the way Rowling can keep you  wondering who the &quot;bad guys&quot; are. The three tasks for the tri-wizard  contest  were incredibly inventive. But why was help so easily offered?  How did that Skeeter woman always seem to know what was happening? I never  seemed to second-guess what would happen. Some people have criticized this  series, but the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; shows  many positive traits  like: teamwork and loyalty (Ron, Harry and Hermione),  ethics &amp; bravery  (Harry and Cedric), social injustice reform (Hermione), and true caring  (Mrs. Weasley, Harry,  Dumbeldore and Sirius).  As an adult, I loved this  book.  Not for the 8 &amp; 9 yr. olds though. Parents should be aware that  there are 3 &quot;mild&quot; swears, a few deaths and some VERY intense  situations here. Read it yourself first, and decide if your child is ready  -most children over 10 will find this the BEST BOOK EVER !	2000-07-11

It's too bad that this review thing will only let you choose 5 as the highest because it deserves at least a 10. This book was the best out of the four so far but it's length made it a little harder to follow. I have  read books much longer than this one but everything in this book seemed  kind of hurried compared to the previous three. The events and new  characters in it are just as original and creatively thought up as much of  the others from the three previous books. I was afraid that Rowling might  have lost a little bit of her creativity or something but I assure you,  this one captured me and pulled me into it just like the other ones. The  whole plot and story line are amazing and you'd never be able to guess what  happens. I read the book in less than two days simply because I couldn't  put it down. I was forced to keep reading and I even delayed meals to  squeeze in some more reading. The entire book was thoroughly enjoyed and it  was better than I expected it to be. Many unexpected turns in the book made  it more enjoyable. Although this book was a little bit darker and more  mysterious than the first and third ones, I still think it had the most  involved and complicated plot which made it better than the others. I am  very glad that I went to the bookstore at 12 o'clock on July 8th to get my  book. It was extremely good and completely worth reading. I hope, and I  certainly think, that everyone will agree when I say that J.K. Rowling has  caught the snitch again with another awesome Harry Potter tale.	2000-07-11

But when you finish reading the last page, you won't stop thinking about  the things in the book for days. The book introduces something that  replaces Quidditch at Hogwarts for this particular year, and replaces it  with a special event that hasn't happened for a century. You'll have to  read the book to find out what it is :) The Goblet of Fire is exactly what  it sounds like, except the flames are blue and at times change to red. Its  purpose surprised me, and as it will probably do to you. Although darker in  parts than the other books (this book introduces the Unforgivable  Curses-pretty self explanatory what they are)and more teen-age at times (it  has a ball in it (as in dancing ball)).

When I had finished everything else I needed to do, I went  out into my family's back yard, where my mother had been reading the book.  As I picked it up, she ran at me, screeching, and grabbed it right out of  my hands.  I finally got a chance to read it on Monday, while she was at  work.  J.K. Rowling has not dissapointed!

Make no mistake, this book is bigger, darker and yes, better than the previous three (although I love each one for different reasons). Any HP fan knows that J.K.

We're  brought closer to Voldemort, we learn more about the history of all the  characters, and Harry, Ron and Hermione's friendship is tested. And all of  them are growing up, too.<br />Yes, it's darker, but don't be daunted by that  nor by the size of the book. Remember that Harry is growing up and it makes  sense that he's ready and able to tackle harder problems at 14 than he was  at 11. It's still an incredible book!<br />Sigh.

I am an adult, and yet I spent the better part of the last two days stealing time to read [and, yes, finish (it isn't short)]this book. Harry Potter is not the world's greatest wizard- J.K. Rowling is. Only  magic can explain her ability to deliver a book as satisfying as  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,&quot; in the face the enormous  pressure, hype, and expectations that built up to it. No mere mortal could  have pulled it off.   Though HPatGoF starts somewhat slowly with a  prologue, it quickly regains momentum with a return visit with the Weasleys  followed by the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. Rowling's  trademark imaginative touches are everywhere: team color badges that scream  the players' names, flags that play their national anthems when waved, and  action figures that are really active.  After that we're back to the fourth  year at Hogwarts where Harry is chosen as its representative in the  Triwizard Tournament against rival schools Durmstrang and Beaux-batons.  Of  course, the threat of Voldemort shrouds the proceedings leading up to a  thrilling wand duel that will not disappoint even the most avid Robin Hood,  Star Wars, or Three Musketeers fans. Sadly, there is also the death of a  beloved character (J.K. warned us) that somehow seems oddly fitting.   &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is a worthy successor to  the three books that came before it.  It entertains and instructs, and in a  world where real-life heroes are often less than heroic it provides role  models for kids of all ages. I eagerly await book five.	2000-07-11

I am 20 years old and would never have thought of reading a &quot;childrens book&quot; if my sister had not waved the first volume in  front of my face and told me it was worth a look. So skeptically i picked  it up and was pulled into a world i have hardly ever been pulled into by a  book. The story was truly immersive. After finishing the first i had to  read the second and third. They only got better as the series went on. This  series of books is truly for all age groups though some children might need  help with the references/language that the books contain. When the fourth  installment came out i knew i had to buy it. I read it in the day that  followed and wish even now that i hadn't finished it so quickly. Waiting  for the next one will be an excrutiating task for I must know what happens  next. The Goblet of Fire is a pivotal book in the series. It outlines the  plot that will start to happen from now on. Rowlings Potter series is  truely captivating. They appeal to the inner child of us all and expand our  imaginations. I definitely recommend this title to anyone who is literate.  Now to wait the 11 months till the next book in the series comes out. It  will be a long wait might as well read the series over again =)	2000-07-11

She  introduces some entertaining new characters, such as the delightfully  detestable Rita Skeeter and the wizard Mad-Eye, while continuing to develop  Harry, Hermione, Ron, and the rest of the familiar cast.

All of the old characters return, and we continue to learn more about them and watch them grow.  In a similar way,  we learn more about the magical world itself.  Ms. Rowling introduces  histories and spells which fit seamlessly with past books, meanwhile  setting the stage for this and future adventures.  The book is fun,  inventive and surprising, with adventures and plot twists capable of  entertaining adults as well as children.<br />Despite the fact that this is by  far the longest Harry Potter book, it is the least stand-alone of the four.  Rudimentary explanations are made for some -- possibly most -- references  to past books, but a new reader to the series would nonetheless have a hard  time understanding what was going on.  This problem is largely a  side-effect of Ms. Rowling's rich use of personality, human interaction,  and world-creation.  Since her characters and plots grow from book to book,  joining the series in the middle becomes like entering a conversation  between siblings.  There is too much history between them to be able to  explain everything without crippling their own conversation.  The easy  solution to this problem: read this book only after you've read the  previous three.<br />More of a disappointment, though, is that the ending may  as well have &quot;TO BE CONTINUED&quot; in blazing letters.  Faithful  readers will recall that there are generally several interrelated plot  lines running through each Harry Potter story.  In this book, the struggle  to gain the goblet of fire is practically the only plot line that reaches a  conclusion.  It is not even the main plot.  Several relationship subplots  also are introduced in this book, but not addressed.  A reader will either  miss them completely, or have to acknowledge that the ongoing references  are mere foreshadowing for a future book.<br />So, &quot;Harry Potter and the  Goblet of Fire&quot; doesn't stand alone. So what?  I've read the first  three, and I plan to read as many future Harry Potter books as Ms. Rowling  will write.

Again, the ending is a complete surprise, even to this fan who  tries to chart her way through the book and deduce the ending.

HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is an odd mixture of excellence and wordiness. It does not disappoint in the action packed sequences of the Quidditch World Cup and its aftermath, the three tasks of the Tri-Wizard  tournament, and Harry's inevitable meeting with Lord Voldemort. However, it  is also packed with such lengthy explanations, that I thought I had  mistakenly picked up HOGWARTS, A HISTORY. This technique of Rowling,  designed to give the reader as much background information as needed,  became noticable at the end of the third book, as Sirius Black and Remus  Lupin explained their relationship with James Potter and Peter Pettigrew.  These portions of the book do not work nearly as well as when Rowling shows  us what happened.<br />Lord Voldemort, the depth of whose evil and reach was  only hinted on in previous volumes, is established, though not seen, in the  first chapter, and the flashbacks and results of his reign of terror which  are revealed throughout the book, make him one of the most terrifying  characters in children's literature that I've met. I feel cold when reading  about him and his followers.<br />Our favorite familiar characters, Harry,  Ron, Hermoine, the Weasleys and their friends and teachers are all becoming  more real with each book. Their development is natural, much like getting  familiar with them as with people in our lives. Newly introduced  characters, however, are a little harder to deal with. So many were  introduced in this book, and my perception of each of them was jerked  around so much that I began to feel as paranoid as Mad-Eye Moody, who had  good reason to feel paranoid.<br />Harry and Hermoine are especially well  developed in this book. Harry grows through his trials in the Tri-Wizard  Tournament, recognizing his limitations and character faults, which paves  the way to conquering them. Hermoine's transformation into the beautiful  swan was satisfying, and it's nice seeing her change from a brainy  know-it-all into a complete person, but her development of a &quot;social  conscience&quot; got a little tiring after a while, and I'm not sure what  parallels, if any, she intends for children to draw from it.<br />Characters  that would be welcomed back in future volumes include Mad-Eye Moody, Victor  Crum and Remus Lupin (from Book 3). I'm also very interested in the future  of the Weasley Twins, because, as Harry says, in the days ahead, a good  laugh will be what everyone needs.<br />We read and listened to this as a  family, having been eagerly awaiting its release.

Hats off to J.K. Rowling for the best Harry Potter.  It was worth the wait.  This book is perhaps a little harder to read for  younger readers.  My seven-year old is on Chapter Nine, but has asked me to  read the rest of the book out-loud to her. (She had no problems reading the  others on her own.) I also thought that this book was scarier than the  first three, so it might be a good idea overall to read this book to a  young reader.  The Durselys only show up for a brief period, but it's a  very gratifying chapter in the book.  The book, as usual, has Harry up  against &quot;You-know-who,&quot; although this time the reader is made  aware of this from the beginning.  Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, is also  back, as promised.  Overall, I really enjoyed the book, and look forward to  reading it again once my daughter finishes it.  My only negative comment  would be about the speaking style of the house-elves.  It was tolerable in  short doses, but gets irritating after a while.  It also seems insensitive  to Afro-Americans.  The story of book 5 is fleshed out in the last few  chapters.  When do we get that one?  Can't wait.	2000-07-11

However the storyline is a lot more sinister than the previous Potter  books. There are parts that reminds me of the events after WWII. I don't  think it is suitable for young children.

I bought the first Harry Potter book for my young son (then 11 years old) and we both got hooked on the series. I found that this 4th book met the high standard of the others -- perhaps even surpassed them in some ways.  Rowling departs from the structure she used in the first three by beginning  this one with a Quidditch match (a World Cup) and in many other ways  throughout this book, which is indeed, as she has told us, darker than the  other ones in terms of what happens by the end.  But not so dark that it is  unsuitable for children in any way, in my opinion.  Perhaps very young  children couldn't handle it (aged under 7 or so) but if you would read your  child a Grimm's fairy tale, you could read this to them.  The book,  however, works on other levels besides fairy tale, and would be interesting  to adults.  Without giving any of the plot away, I can say that the  descriptions in this book of life under Voldemort will strike anyone as  psychologically true, if they are familiar with life under the various  police states in the 20th century and Rowling makes a powerful plea for  tolerance as she includes many characters from countries other than England  in this book.  However, the book doesn't become heavy at all -- her sense  of humor is marvelously intact, as are all the little magical details that  make the series so special, ranking in my opinion with the other great  fantasies of the twentieth century -- Tolkien, Lewis, Lloyd Alexander and  The Never-ending Story.	2000-07-11

After the first three books, which gave us a  taste of the evil forces that Harry faces, here we see them truly in action  and they are as terrifying and dreadful as we thought they could be.  While  bad things happened in the earlier books, &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is the  point of no return: Voldemort and his allies must be dealt with.<br />At the  same time, Harry and his friends still enjoy the Quidditch World Cup and  behave like any kids at their first dance (like a lot of us, Harry is  awkward and uncomfortable!).  Yet he is forced to grow up faster than he'd  like; he gets some interesting career advice, but his fate - to battle  Voldemort - may close in on him before he gets to act on it.<br />We see the  truth of Dumbledore's statement in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; that it's not  who you're born, but what you become that counts.

Dobby rejoins the troupe, along with Winky, a new  house-elf. Less appealing than Dobby, this melancholy pixy gives Hermione  fuel for her crusade to liberate house-elves, a nice bit of comic relief in  this darkest of the Potter novels.  J.K. Rowlings is total master of the  psychology of her characters as well as of her readers.  From the beginning  of the book, stress (and suspense) build to a climax, are resolved, and  after we've all had a breather, the next adventure is upon us and the pages  must keep on turning faster.  Nuances are revealed in the old familiar  characters (Hagrid with a love interest!). More than in the first three,  there is violence, death and evil in this fourth story.  But I would not  steer young children away from it because this world is also full of evil  happenings.  The sinister actions of the villains only play up the basic  goodness, courage and selflessness of Harry and his friends.  To  appreciate this book the reader should really begin with the first in the  series.  The macabre events in the Chapter One of Goblet of Fire make sense  if you've already been introduced to the villain.  And there is a wonderful  development of personality and character in the principals over the course  of the four books.  This book begins with a ghastly happening and when  it concludes, there has been an incredible amount of plotting and mayhem,  much of which goes unresolved.

This first line draws you in, calling you back to the world of  wizards, house-elves, muggles, and magic.     Starting first where we  stopped at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, we find  Harry staying with his insufferable relatives, the Dursleys.  One night he  has a nightmare, and wakes up with searing pain stemming from his lightning  bolt scar.  This is just a beginning to what he must endure throughout the  school year at Hogwarts.   Before the summer is over, Harry does manage to  escape the Dursleys when Ron Weasley invites him to the Quidditch World Cup  (which is hosted by Britain this year).  It was all fun and games until  trouble arose; a huge sign was conjured in the sky, frightening many, and  causing questions over the whereabouts of he-who-must-not-be-named.   Once  Harry, Ron, and Hermione reach Hogwarts and attend the Welcoming Ceremony,  they are unhappy to find (along with their fellow students), that Quidditch  will not be played this year.  Instead, an even greater event is taking  place: the Triwizard Tournament!  Hosted and participated in by Hogwarts,  two other rival wizard schools will compete to win the Triwizard Cup.  Each  school is allowed one pupil, seventeen and older to contend.   Things go a  little wrong, and instead of three &quot;champions&quot; a fourth is  chosen.  But each chosen one must go through with the very dangerous tasks  they are presented with.    In a nutshell, this school year hasproven to  be the toughest for Harry so far: he goes from being well-liked by his  peers to made fun of daily, he almost loses his best friend completely,  Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape continue to be maladies, he must deal with  the ravages and angst of being fourteen, all on top of the fact that  someone is out to kill him and he must figure out who, what, where, and  when.   By the time you get to the last chapters, you're still in the dark,  until the last moment, and then everything falls into place.   J.K. Rowling  is most imaginative, creative, and amazingly descriptive when it comes to  telling us Harry's story. These books aren't just for kids, they're for  people of all ages.  Everyone can enjoy them on their own levels.   I read  this book in three days, but I would have gotten through it sooner, had I  not had a brother and a sister who were also taking turns reading.   Here's  a post script to Miss Rowling:   Hurry and write Harry Potter Five, please!   My mind is craving more of your intellectually stimulating stories!	2000-07-11

The adventure is something every kid dreams about. It brings back the memory of the adventures the young-at-heart used to dream about  and make us believe again. It has everything a book is supposed to have in  a language that is easy and enjoyable for all. Aside from trying to learn  what muggles are and the occasional monster that Hagrid loves so much.  There is a plot, a beginning, middle and end. Each book is separate story  and they all link to one another. It helps young readers to build their  imagination and to expand our dwindling ones (young-at-hearts.) I  personally read books for pleasure, and research. And I have added the  Harry Potter's to my list. I look forward to the time when I have children  or my nephews are old enough for me to read to them.  Young readers enjoy  it because they can relate and are at an age that they can still dream  about expand their dreams to include themselves as Harry's friends or  counter-parts in his achievements. For the young-at-heart, he brings us  back to our childhood and our imagination. And allows us relief from the  routine and mundane of our world. He brings laughter and mischief to  everyone he touches. (Except Snape and the Slytherins, and  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.)  That is why I enjoyed reading Harry, look  forward to his next books and adventures and give him 5 stars.	2000-07-11

Some of my favourite authors are Gore Vidal, John Irving and Tom Wolf. I must admit, however, to having a serious soft spot for J.K.Rowlings Harry Potter stories and her latest, The Goblet of Fire, is no exception.<br />This, the fourth in her series of, apparently, seven books, is twice the  size of Harry's previous outings and begins with the wonderfully teasing  setup of the Riddle House bringing  with it the return of you-know-who,  through the Quidditch World Cup, the return to Hogwarts<br />and.... (you'll  have to read it to find out more ! ). As with all the HP books, it pays to  read the earler parts carefully as clues abound and everything (well  almost everything...)  is beautifully tidied up by the end.<br />I began  reading the book worrying that JK might not be able to maintain the  inventiveness, the cleverness and the carefull plotting of the previous  books. I should not have worried as, in many ways, this one is the best so  far.<br />Maybe younger people enjoy these books for their sense of adventure  and I get that too but, as an adult, this is pure soul food.	2000-07-11

Also like the previous three, I found myself captivated by the writings of J.K. Rowling.<br />The fourth book lives up to  the rest with it's exciting descriptions and plot twists.  Moreover, the  book does seem to drag a bit at the beginning.  Harry and Hermione Granger  (one of Harry's best friends at Hogwart's) are invited to attend the  Quidditch World Cup with the Weasley family.  Ron Weasley being Harry's  other best friend at Hogwart's.  There are some humorous situations as the  author descibes the attire worn by various witches and wizards who are  trying to resemble muggles (non-magical people).  The Quidditch match  itself is not as exciting as those played by Harry and his team against  other houses at Hogwart's.  Possibly because the reader has not been able  to develop an understanding of the World Cup players as thoroughly as the  players at Hogwart's.<br />Chapter twelve was when I was finally able to feel  some familiarity with the previous books.  It is in this chapter that Harry  returns to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  The arrival of  the students at school mimic the same details as before with the exception  of the cancelling of Quidditch games in favor of the Triwizard Tournament.  An event which has not taken place in over a hundred years.  For this  tournament, representatives from two other schools of witchcraft will  descend upon the school as they compete to win.  Although there is suppose  to be only one champion from each school,  Harry's name is somehow  regurgitated by the Goblet of Fire as a participant.  This leads to three  tasks that the players must compete at.  All the descriptions of the tasks  are riveting and the reader will find themself turning the pages  frantically to find out what will happen next.  It is during these three  tasks that the unfortunate death of a key person takes place casting a dark  feel for the rest of the book.<br />The end of the book does not leave the  reader with the same feelings as the previous three, but rather a bit  detached.  The author has left many story lines open to address in the  following installments which of course will have the reader greatly  anticipating the arrival of those books.<br />All in all, the book was a  fantastic read proving that J.K. Rowling is a true master of fiction.for the rest of the book.<br />The end of the book does not leave the  reader with the same feelings as the previous three, but rather a bit  detached.

Once you start reading, you will not want to put the book down.  I read the book in less that 24  hours!  Yes, 24 hours!  To be honest, for fans of the first 3 books,  there are places where the story does slow.  But that is because we already  know that Harry is a wizard and lives with Muggles.  We are already  familiar with Harry, his friends, his enemies, and Hogwarts.  But for new  readers, they need to know this information.  Although I would hope that  new readers to the series start with Book 1.<br />As an adult who has lost  count of the books I have read, I am finding all of the Harry Potter books  to be entertaining.  I wish they were available back when I was a child.  Maybe I would have read even more.  Well, they would have been added to all  of the others that I read like &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lion,  the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;.<br />Will I reread the book?  Yes, I  already have plans to take it with me to the beach to reread in a few  weeks.  I am looking forward to rereading about Fred and George's antics  and about Fawkes the phoenix..  And yes, reading about Harry's learning  experiences again.	2000-07-11

It is the best book so far in the Harry Potter Series. I finished it in 8 and a half hours. It was so good that my mom had to drag me out of my bed. I suggest if you are going  to read this book you better do the things you planed to do before you read  the book. I also suggest you find a nice comfortable spot to read. I<br />  I guess the main story starts when Albus Dumbledore announced about  the Triwizard Contest which 3 different schools compete with each other.  Each person who is 17 or older could enter the contest, all you have to do  is put your name and the school name into the Goblet of Fire and it will  choose a champion from each school. For the safety of the people Dumbledore  put an under age spell so that no one can enter who is of under age. In the  contest you will find all sorts of dangers which needs alot of daring and  courage. But you also get rewarded for the Contest if you win, 1000  galleons. Thats the big catch, when someone enters Harry's name in the  Goblet of Fire the whole school was astonished when the Goblet of Fire  picked 2 people from Hogwarts. That's when the story takes an odd twist.  Harry faces all sorts of dangers which needs alot of courage and daring.  What's worse is that Ron is jealous and angry and thinks that Harry has  entered the contest just to get some attention. This book has alot of  surprises and I love the way it ends. The ending is so shocking that for a  moment I could not believe it. This story has a very nice twist and I  reccomend you to read it. I can bet you anything that you will like it.  Another peice of advice: Have some snacks around beacause you will not be  getting up very soon! I wish I could tell you more but if I do it would  totally spoil the story.<br />  Like the review?  Consider reading this  book. This book deserves more than five stars.. Now I wonder when the fifth  book will be coming in!  Good Luck to you and trust me, please use my  suggestions. Have a nice time...ions. Have a nice time...	2000-07-11

Unlike the overpublicized prequel to Lucas' Star Wars movies, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire lives up to its billing. The fourth installment in J. Rowling's series about an orphaned boy who discovers that he is someone  special in a world beyond imagination, Goblet of Fire has already shattered  sales records.<br />Is it worth it?<br />You bet! Rowling is a masterful writer.  Her characters are realistic yet quirky enough to be memorable, and her  plots are intricate but not so complicated that younger readers won't be  able to follow them. Clues to the surprising final outcome are scattered  throughout the book, and the story ends with a wonderful sense of closure,  while at the same time leaving a few significant plot threads dangling,  hinting at what's to come in the next book.<br />My personal favorite moments  are usually provided by the Weasley family. Nearly all readers will be able  to relate closely to them. They seem so normal - what kid hasn't had her  mother yell at her for leaving her toys around? And yet the magical world  is such a part of their lives that it gives their normalcy an offbeat  flavor.<br />Parents who are worried about the tone of this book can rest a  bit easier. Yes, a major character does die. However, Rowling does not  delve into spectacular gore or violence. Instead, it is handled  realistically and compassionately. It is an excellent way to introduce to  children the idea that sometimes bad things happen to nice people.<br />The  only bugaboo I had with this book was that the  Hermione Granger subplot  was not adequately resolved. It might be carried over to the next book,  though, so I'll just have to wait and see how it ends.<br />Overall: GO OUT  AND GET THIS BOOK!	2000-07-11

Just as the rumors  indicated, there is darkness  and death in this book, but none of it is  there for show.  Every character, every incident in the plot, every  description  of scenery are important to the plot.  It was good to see  all the favorites from the first three books in this one, too.  Sirius  Black, Hermione Granger, the Weasley clan, and even the nasty Slytherins  are here, and Rowling does a great job of continuing to develop their  characters.  The increasing strength of Voldemort adds the expected  sinister tone to the book, and the Weasley twins balance the scary scenes  with hilarious ones.  Their business enterprises are very appropriate and  add comic relief to the novel.  Certainly, no reader will forget the  Quidditch World Cup, the Goblet of Fire scene, or the Triwizard Tournament.  Once again, Rowling has created a vivid fantasy world, rife with magical  spells and the classic showdowns between good and evil.  This book will  only make readers want to read more!	2000-07-11

Im not ashamed to say it to anyone, im proud of it. I decided to buy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire the day it came out. I had never read a Harry Potter book before and i was a bit skeptical, i thought they  were like some long, cheezy versions of the goosebumps books i bought when  i was younger.  I wasnt even thinking of buying it...but it just called to  me in the Virgin Megastore in NYC, where i was looking at the cds and DVDs.  And it was on sale, so i thought...what the heck?  I love books, and i read  all kinds. So, i bought the book.  I was so anxious to read it, i hardly  slept that night. I got up early the next morning and opened it up, and it  seemed like i didnt put it down after that. The pages just flew by until i  finished a few hours ago. The story was just so smooth and good and easy to  read, it was like watching a tv show.  I thought i would be lost cause i  never read any of the other books, but for the most part, the book  explained everything. I think i liked the book so much because i could  identify with Harry. Being only a year older, i could understand alot of  things, such as his nervousness about the competition and about the dance.  The whole dance thing was written very well, showing not a fairy tale happy  ending, but a sadder ending, which many teens can relate to. Overall, it  was a fun story and a joy to read, and ill also be going out and buying the  other three books.  Consider me a converted man.	2000-07-11

I am one of those adults who got hooked on Harry Potter, even without any children as an excuse.  I bought my niece the first three books for Christmas, and counted down the days until this release with her.  I was shocked by the length of the book when it arrived...  I wondered if  there was really so much to be said that it could fill all those pages.  The second I started reading, though, I knew the answer was YES!<br />This  book is by far the most complex and scary of the Harry Potter books thus  far.  Harry is entering his fourth year of school, and in addition to  learning more complex spells, Harry is also growing personally, and we see  him maturing throughout the book.  I loved the scene with his first  dance...  it brought back so many memories of my own first dances.<br />The  length of the book is also a sign of the maturing plot...  the first 100 or  so pages pass before Harry even returns to Hogwarts!  But, the story is  enthralling from page one, and the new characters are developped very  nicely during this section.  Once Harry returns to school, the action grows  ever deeper... he learns new, more dangerous spells, and we realize how  much he has learned in his previous three years at school.  The action in  this book builds up slowly; Harry knows that somone is out there, but he's  not sure who, or why.  And so, the best defense is to keep on learning, and  to keep his eyes open, studying all those around him.  The secrets will be  revealed soon enough...<br />If I had to complain about anything in this  book, it would be the way plots from the previous stories were entered into  it; at times it seemed that Rowling grew impatient with explaining what had  ocurred in the previous stories.  But since the books build upon each  other, some background was necessary.  I think the best preparation for  book 4 is to read the first three books, and then to jump in an enjoy this  newest offering...

It is an incredible tome, sure to delight children  and adults alike. There is the assortment of colorful and delightful  characters that please the imagination, and in this installation, there is  darkness and dread that was hinted at in previous volumes, but is explored  more fully in this book. Starting with a bang at the Quidditch World Cup,  and following the exploits of the 4 Champions at the TriWizards Tournament,  which is held at Hogwarts School this year - it gives us a chance to see  Harry, Hermione, Ron and Hagrid in a new set of circumstances that help  define them more as characters, ones that we have loved and grow to care  about as time goes on.

This book is to the Harry Potter series what &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was to the Star Wars trilogy. We learn more about our favorite characters; we watch them as they  continue to mature; the stage is set for the ultimate conflict in the  future; and the story takes a darker turn. Young readers who gobbled up the  adventures and perils of the first three books will find things are getting  tougher. Good people die, while others who should be fighting don't step  up. We also find out that some people we didn't like are really on the  right side.  We've gotten to know our main characters in the first three  books, and we continue to learn and care about them.  Everybody has an  opinion who Harry, Ron, and Hermione should get romantically involved with,  which I think is a sign of well drawn characters.<br />This book is not  perfect. It drags in one or two places; the transitions are not entirely  smooth. It's not serious.<br />I believe the Potter books are as popular as  they are because what people really want to read and hear is a Story, the  kind where you can't wait to know what happens next to the people you care  about, the kind of thing that could be read aloud around a fireplace.  This  book delivers that and sets up what is to come. When I finished this book,  I had the exact same feeling I get at the top of a roller-coaster hill just  before the car tips over.

I have just finished and, I think, fully absorbed theexperience of the fourth Harry Potter.  It is a very fast read, owingto the fact that it can't be put down easily.  Happily, the patterns that the first books started falling into, are broken here and the ideas are a little fresher.  It is incredible, looking back through, how little is wasted in Rowling's writing.  All the little details she includes, no matter how seemingly frivolous at the time, are cornerstones to the architecture of the fantasy. I must include, sadly, a &quot;however,&quot; here...My pleasure in this  series is fading somewhat as the sinister and adult themes are on the rise  and the innocence is becoming lost.  This may seem to be nit-picking, but I  think the greatest pleasure derived from the series by the adult readers is  an innocent awe at the magical world.  That naivete gone, the books will  begin to appeal, I think, more to younger readers, who aren't looking back  too fondly on youth and inexperience, than to adults.  This is the way it  should be, I realize, and I only knock a star off for the way the book  affects me.  Rowling is treating the material as it must be treated and  doing fabulously with it.

I thought it would drag out (I mean, 752 pages!)and the length just wouldn't work. I had no idea  the skill JK Rowling has. She took her characters and really added to their  life as witches and wizards. They, among other things, went to see the  Quidditch World Cup, which I found an exciting addition, and a part that  could even be a book itself, where the terror and intrigue you always find  in a Harry Potter book started, with the return of the terrible Death  Eaters, the followers of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. She described so vividly  their return, in a way that sent horrifying prickles down my spine, the  same way the first chapter, already bringing sudden deaths, did. But on a  lighter side, even though evilk always stalks Hogwarts, Harry, Hermione and  Ron, did begin to grow up, and found romance of sorts where they'd least  expect it . . . I don't want to give anything away, but the action, and the  danger with it, was unbelievable. Harry faces his greatest challenge yet,  in more ways then one. No one is who you think they are, and no one can be  trusted. A friend may not be, and an enemy might change. The ending was  troubling, and left us wondering what is to become of the not-so-perfect  life of the wizarding community. It left me with an unsettled feeling that  something's just not right, and left me wanting to know more. But even as  secrets are left, many are revealed. The mystery of Herry's parents is  told, and you learn something rather startling about one of Harry's close  friends, Neville. Although this was certainly the darkest of all of her  books, I feel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was definitely a success.  If you read one book this summer, I would definitely recommend it to be  this one, no matter how old you are. This will appeal to kids and grown-ups  alike.	2000-07-11

It's too bad that this review thing will only let you choose 5 as the highest because it deserves at least a 10. This book was the best out of the four so far but it's length made it a little harder to follow. I have read books much longer than this one but everything in this book seemed  kind of hurried compared to the previous three. The events and new  characters in it are just as original and creatively thought up as much of  the others from the three previous books. I was afraid that Rowling might  have lost a little bit of her creativity or something but I assure you,  this one captured me and pulled me into it just like the other ones. The  whole plot and story line are amazing and you'd never be able to guess what  happens. I read the book in less than two days simply because I couldn't  put it down. I was forced to keep reading and I even delayed meals to  squeeze in some more reading. The entire book was thoroughly enjoyed and it  was better than I expected it to be. Many unexpected turns in the book made  it more enjoyable. Although this book was a little bit darker and more  mysterious than the first and third ones, I still think it had the most  involved and complicated plot which made it better than the others. I am  very glad that I went to the bookstore at 12 o'clock on July 8th to get my  book. It was extremely good and completely worth reading. I hope, and I  certainly think, that everyone will agree when I say that J.K. Rowling has  caught the snitch again with another awesome Harry Potter tale.	2000-07-11

Just like the first three books, this installment of the Harry Potter series reached right out, grabbed me, and would not let go until I had read the entire thing. I finished it the evening it was released.<br />Once again,  Rowling has created a plot containing twists and turns that outstrip most  adult-targeted books I've ever read. The clues, as always, were right there  in black and white, yet I did not see them on the first read through. And  just like before, she has included hundreds of the little details that make  the world of Harry Potter come alive.<br />Goblet of Fire definitely takes a  turn for the darker, though. It is not as whimisical as earlier books in  the series, offering many points in the plot that are far 'scarier' and  tinged with the evilness of Lord Voldemort. There *are* more deaths in this  book than we've seen before, and while they are not graphically described,  no punches are pulled in making it clear that the characters are indeed  dead by evil's hand.<br />For me as an adult, of course, this was a high  point of this book--not the killings per se, of course, but I enjoyed  seeing the series really get down to business, so to speak. To see the  battle lines being drawn and the war you know is coming take shape. But for  perhaps extremely young readers or listeners, it's something to be aware of  nonetheless.<br />Much like the entire series, I can't recommned Goblet of  Fire highly enough--this imaginative world, and the fight between good and  evil that it portrays, is worthy of every ounce of praise it has ever  received. Enjoy!	2000-07-11

The fourth installment of Harry Potter's adventures is well worth its extra length.  The plot twists contain a number of surprises, and our heroes go through quite realistic teenage anxieties and problems.  The  Triwizard Tournament (and the dark deeds behind it) develops nicely, with  surprises waiting for the unsuspecting reader.  It is darker than the  previous books, with some scenes which may be a bit intense for younger  readers (though not graphic in their description).  However, this is a  logical development of the overall plot, and serves to set up the conflict  forthcoming in the remaining three volumes of the series.  Though one of  the longest children's books I've ever seen, it reads quickly and refuses  to be set aside--every chapter begs the reader to turn just one more page,  and the old friends from previous books and new characters beg you to share  just one more scene with them.  A good read for older children (10+) and  adults.	2000-07-11

My plan had been to read it during lunch breaks for the next few weeks. I ended up taking it home, sitting down, and reading until 2am. It isn't  often that I sit down and read 700+ pages in one sitting, but the Harry  Potter stories are nothing if not infectious. This is easily the most  complex and darkest of the books; touching on political activism, budding  sexuality, jealousy, and the dangers of petty beaurocracy. Indeed, in many  ways it feels like the second act of a play, bringing the entire cast of  characters to their darkest hour, and leaving you with the certain  knowledge that the last page is only a pause in a  much larger story.  All  that being said, however, this remains Harry Potter in all its charm,  magic, humor, sweetness and delicious tension. I can't wait to see what  happens next.	2000-07-11

It was obvious  that this book would be quite different in style than the previous three.  The language and the overall theme were decidely more mature than the  previous stories, and don't forget this book was a whopping 700+ pages  (unusual for a book classified as &quot;childrens  literature&quot;).<br />Unlike the previous three, this latest in the Harry  Potter series was much more suspenseful, but in a more adult-like fashion.  Perhaps, this was deliberate on the part of J.K. Rowlings. After all, our  teen hero is also becoming older and more mature with each book. The tone  of the entire first half of the book radiated a strong sense of foreboding.  At the end of the book, the reader was left with a sense of anxiety, doom,  but with a fervent hope. This book was definitely darker than the first  three.<br />By far, this was J.K. Rowling's best work. Due to the writing  style and some of the themes, elements presented, this book could easily be  classified as adult literature, or at least literature for young adults.<br />Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire was a very good read. The writing  style was much more vivid, richly developed, mature, and clever than Books  1, 2, or 3. It was quite the chiller!	2000-07-11

The  Goblet of Fire puts Harry and his friends into deeper danger then ever  before.  The number of challenges put in front of Harry in this book makes  the dangers he faced in the first three seem pale in comparison.  In this  installment, more questions are answered about the rise of You-Know-Who's  power.  A clearer picture emerges as to why everyone is so terrified of  ever seeing  his powers return.  Harry Potter remains the humble hero, and  he has matured at 14, but in a way that children of all ages can still  relate to.  Just as with the first three, this book was impossible to put  down.

The Goblet of Fire, is overall great.  However, this is one case where perhaps Rowling  went too far in plotting and dropping details that may or may not flower  into important hints about just what danger lies ahead for Harry.  Goblet  gets off to a decidedly slow start, and for some reason I can't quite put  my finger on, seems to have lost the &quot;fun magic.&quot;  There are lots  of events that couldn't happen in the Muggle world, but these seem rather  drab... perhaps I have come to accept the excitement of Quiditch and other  fantastic adventures as the norm, but I found the first half of the book a  little too much like watching football on TV and flipping to some crime  show during the commercials. All in all though, this was definitely a page  turner and we get to see more of the favorite characters who have become  not only Harry's, but all of our friends.

It starts  off with the murder of the riddles and how a frank bryce was accused of  killing them. when frank bryce is killed himself by Lord Voldemort and the  help of his snake, Nagini Harry Potter wakes up. It starts off right away  with the Quidditch world Cup, a lot of humor thanks to Fred and George  Weasley, and has a lot of gloom in it too. When J.K Rowling said there  would be death in this book she wasnt kidding. THe end is amazing, with  Cornelius fudge's stubborness, Snape secret, Dumledore's nobleness and  harry's courage. Harry Potter truly is a role model for me, to stand true  and to not back down to evil in this case Lord Voldemort. this whole book  showed me the evilness of evil, noblest a person can be, the courage in  side everyone and the light always shining in the end.

I was among the first in line to recieve my copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire on July 8th, and no sooner had I arrived home, I was already curled up on the couch, engrossed in this novel.<br />Year 4 at Hogwarts brings us many changes to the standard Harry Potter plot. After summer  and  the Quidditch World Cup have ended, the sport that Harry loves so much  disappears from J.K. Rowling's text. In its place, a tournament between 3  &quot;Champions&quot;, one each from Hogwarts and two other foreign schools  of wizardry. And besides Harry's lightening-shaped scar continuously  hurting, you'd almost never know that evil Lord Voldemort had anything to  do with the year at school.<br />Not only has the standard plot of the series  changed a little, but the characters have as well. Harry, now at 14, finds  himself almost cynical and annoyed with people, he's matured, and I have to  say that I like him much better now. Ron struggles harder than ever to find  individuality, as Charlie and Bill, his brothers, return home, making  it  even harder to get lost in the crowd of redheads. Even twins Fred and  George seem to be growing up. Hermione takes charge towards a good cause,  and finds herself becoming more physically attractive, and in the likes of  a boy.<br />I know that older readers will be enjoying this novel much more  than its suggested age group. Besides its length, there are many things  that may just be too creepy for them, slightly more so than the previous  books. The Unforgivable Curses are a  matter of torture, used continuously throughout the book. Limbs are chopped  off, among other physical harm. I, personally, love this changes. It shows  that Rowling has grown comfortable to writing about Hogwarts and about  Harry, and I love what she's done. Not only is the world she's created  realistic, it's incredibly easy to imagine yourself in, to get caught up in  it. Don't be frightened by its length, for I know you will pick up Harry  Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and not put it down until ever last word on  page 734 echoes through your mind.

Harry even begins to have an interest in girls. Voldemort will have a stronger presence in this one and you will learn things about several characters' pasts that will make things in the previous books make more sense.

Every favorite cast member is back: Harry, Ron and the Weasleys, Hermione, Dumbledore, Hagrid, the villanous Snape, along with Malfoy and his  Slytherin cronies.  Dobby rejoins the troupe, along with Winky, a new  house-elf. Less appealing than Dobby, this melancholy pixy gives Hermione  fuel for her crusade to liberate house-elves, a nice bit of comic relief in  this darkest of the Potter novels.  J.K. Rowlings is total master of the  psychology of her characters as well as of her readers.  From the beginning  of the book, stress (and suspense) build to a climax, are resolved, and  after we've all had a breather, the next adventure is upon us and the pages  must keep on turning faster.  Nuances are revealed in the old familiar  characters (Hagrid with a love interest!). More than in the first three,  there is violence, death and evil in this fourth story.  But I would not  steer young children away from it because this world is also full of evil  happenings.  The sinister actions of the villains only play up the basic  goodness, courage and selflessness of Harry and his friends.      To  appreciate this book the reader should really begin with the first in the  series.  The macabre events in the Chapter One of Goblet of Fire make sense  if you've already been introduced to the villain.  And there is a wonderful  development of personality and character in the principals over the course  of the four books.      This book begins with a ghastly happening and when  it concludes, there has been an incredible amount of plotting and mayhem,  much of which goes unresolved.  I wanted to turn the page when the last  chapter concluded and keep on reading.  So many questions are hanging there  for the next volume that could not have been answered in those 734 pages.       I am an adult reader (age 61) of this book who reads a great deal,  mostly nonfiction.  I like the Harry Potter books very much because the  action is entirely original, the plots are perfect, the characters  beautifully drawn, the proper names sheer genius, the funny situations  hilarious, the dialog finely tuned, the timing and pace breathtaking, and  the psychology the work of a virtuoso.    I shall keep rereading until  Harry Potter V makes its debut.	2000-07-11

I finally put it down and went to bed at about 2:30 in the morning.  It was an absolutely enthralling read.<br />This book is much darker and scarier in content than  the previous books, and has a much more &quot;adult&quot; feel. One feels  by the end of the book that the gloves are off as regards Magic/Muggle  relations, and the past/future supporters of Voldemort (I won't say more,  as I don't want to spoil it for anyone) - in other words, the risks are  increasing, and there is much more at stake for the protagonists than  losing the House Cup to Slytherin.<br />The book is also extremely funny in  places, and pokes a bit of sly fun at the English tabloid press (of which,  unfortunately for her, Ms. Rowling is all too familiar), international  relations, and the various pitfalls of dating and romance, among other  things.<br />As mentioned, there is also a romantic subplot featuring various  characters that is charming, and wholly in keeping with the ways boys and  girls (wizards or no) gradually discover an interest in the opposite sex as  they advance into their teens.<br />The same themes of the importance of  friendship, sticking up for one's principles, defending the weak or  &quot;different&quot;, and treating others as one would like to be treated  are continued in this installment. As usual, the message of tolerance and  love is well-expressed without being preachy.<br />I am afraid there may be  some little outcry against Ms. Rowling due to some extremely minor swearing  and some slightly off-color jokes.  Since I don't have kids, this didn't  bother me at all (I don't think it would bother me even if I did), but I am  sure a few of the more reactionary parental units out there will be  freaking out over the Damage to America's Youth.  God knows they should be  more worried about the WWF.<br />In any case, most enjoyable, and I can hardly  wait for the next book.  I hope we don't have long to wait!!	2000-07-11

I just finished reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  Wow! It was an extremely powerful book.  The ending has all the twists and turns we have come to expect from the author.  I must admit it took me a little longer to get into the book since this one does not start out with Harry at  the Dursleys as we have come to expect.  It seems like she decided to  change the format slightly to keep us all guessing although it does go from  summer to summer like the others, but she made some changes in the flow of  the school year.  There are many new characters, including new schools of  magic.  Initially it is difficult to keep them all straight.  Rowling does  an excellent job of including past history to refresh our memories.  She  brings back many pivotal characters from the other books.  She is also  fabulous at capturing the emotions of a 14 year old dealing with  loneliness, friendship, ridicule and dating. She deals with some social  issues as in the past, but the funniest is the introduction of the wizard  press.  This book continues the trend of being a little darker than the  last.  I asked my 8 year old if it scared him at all and he said it did a  little.  But he was quite taken with the battle that she sets up at the  end. (I don't want to give anything away)  There are some deaths in this  one - the one closest to the main characters is handled touchingly.  This  novel brought me to tears in a few places, and had me laughing out loud in  others.  I can't wait for number 5!	2000-07-11

Harry Potter and the Goblet Fire, the fourth book in the Harry Potter Series, finally came into my possession at 12:10 in the morning of July 8th.  Let me tell you, first off, that I am fourteen, and while I don't consider myself an adult, I certainly don't consider myself a &quot;little  kid.&quot;  What I'm trying to say is, don't let yourself be fooled into  thinking it is only a children's book.  It is in fact an amazing story full  of imaginative characters and plot lines worthy of the undying interest of  people of all ages.  I definately recommend you read this book--the other  ones first, of course.<br />First thing you need to know is that the story of  this book is much longer, more complicated, and a little darker than the  other three.  At 734 pages long, it supports an incredible plot that mixes  fantasy and mystery together.  I won't ruin it for you, of course, but I  will say that the reader is hooked by the end of every chapter and is not  able to put it down due to the many surprises and twists.  I know; I stayed  up till three in the morning reading it.  There is no Quidditch, a magical  sport played by wizards, between the four houses at the magical school of  Hogwarts for young witches and wizards in this book(!), but that is taken  care of in the beginning of the story at the . . . drum roll, please . . .  International World Cup Quidditch Match!  The new competition is, instead,  the Triwizard Tournament, and it takes place between three magic  schools--the other two, we have never heard of before this story.  Each has  one &quot;champion&quot; chosen to compete against the other schools'.  That is what the main plot is about--the three challenges they compete in,  along with basic life at the school.  The plot underneath, though, is just  as amazing and even more mysterious.  For the first time, readers will  begin to learn the histories of many characters.  This book, in fact,  focuses on the past and reveals many marvelous secrets.  There is a reason  for this, of course:  history will play an imporatant roll in the  future.<br />Just to explain, the reason I said this book was darker is  because You-Know-Who, Lord Voldemort, makes a more prominent appearance in  this story.  Expect sadness and some O' that black magic, but don't be  afraid--it's only a book.  If anything, this story is even more enjoyable  for adults.<br />The characters are again magical and fun, full of surprises  and human emotions.  You will get the feeling as you read that you are  Harry--yes, you--and you will be hurt, happy, sad, and scared every time he  is.  You will grow a bond with some characters, and you will learn to  hate--even if you don't make a habbit of doing so in real life--others  (Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy come to mind).  Hermione, Ron, and Hagrid  make their comeback, along with Sirius Black--hurray!--and Dumbledore.  There are many new characters in this book, most of which are from the  other magic schools, but the main focus is on old ones. Expect to learn  more about characters from the other books--ones you might have thought  weren't so special; each is very important to the very complicated plot.  Also, each character changes in this story.  They grow, come of age, and  begin to take an interest in members of the opposite sex.  Could there be  romance in the air?  Yes, but I'll let you find out who with whom by  yourself.<br />In conclusion, this book is the pivotal one in the series.  If  you don't read this one, you will not understand anything to come after it.  This is where the story begins.  Think of the others as a kind of  &quot;long prequel&quot; because the future looks very different now than  it did before, and we will look forward to reading the next books, which  will show us a very strange future. . . .a reason  for this, of course:  history will play an imporatant roll in the  future.<br />Just to explain, the reason I said this book was darker is  because You-Know-Who, Lord Voldemort, makes a more prominent appearance in  this story.

Though the book's length  may give rise to caution among those wary of sequels, J.K. Rowling has by  no means succumbed to the diarrhea of the pen too often found in writers of  multiple bestsellers.  Like the previous three Harry books, &quot;The  Goblet of Fire&quot; is well paced and tautly structured.  It really does  require all 734 pages of the American edition to tell the whole intricate  story, or rather, as much of the story as the author will reveal at this  time.<br />In book four, Rowling (intentionally or not) gives a nod to many  questions large and small posed by her fans.  We learn who does the cooking  and cleaning at Hogwarts, what happened to Neville Longbottom's parents,  how to pronounce &quot;Hermione,&quot; where other schools of magic may be  found, and what Dumbledore can really be like when he's angry.  We learn  more about Hagrid, the Malfoys, and Snape (one of the most interesting  developments is a hint that Snape's relationship with Harry may undergo a  change for the better in the future).  Along with Harry, Ron, and Hermione,  we learn of hexes and curses and defenses against the Dark Arts.  And  always, Rowling manages to weave together the least details and most  seemingly unrelated subplots into a whole that is cohesive, uncontrived,  and satisfying - though leaving the reader wanting much more.  At about  page 600 I found myself very sorry that there were only 100-some pages to  go, because I knew that this would be all I would have until book five.  I  haven't felt that way about a book since hearing Sam Gamgee say &quot;Well,  I'm back,&quot; and wishing I could keep following him, Frodo, and their  friends through more adventures in Middle-earth.<br />The much-discussed first  forays into romance for the leading characters are lightly and deftly  handled, and while important are certainly not a main focus of the book.  The effect of the romance subplots is to show how Harry, Ron, and Hermione  are growing up and beginning to see themselves and one another in new ways.  Along with romantic yearnings, they begin to exhibit other changes: Ron  becomes edgier and more outspoken, Hermione learns to shrug off ridicule  and be less rule-bound, and Harry continues to develop the bravery and  valor of his parents - and of his House's founder, Godric  Gryffindor.<br />Harry's biggest challenges so far, not surprisingly, come in  this book.  Instead of flying in Quidditch matches, he is involved in an  important year-long event that has temporarily superseded Quidditch at  Hogwarts.  The challenges he overcomes in the course of this event form the  core of the book.  Woven into the story are Lord Voldemort and his  servants, and their attempts to bring He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named back to full  life and power.  Mysterious disappearances and even a death or two in  &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; have, as in any good mystery story, more  than one plausible suspect; and, as with any good mystery story, the  solution ultimately eluded my several attempts at deductive reasoning -  though the clues are present.<br />Death casts a shadow over book four,  particularly in the final chapters, where the usually boisterous  end-of-year banquet is quite somber and the conclusion of the special  year-long event is robbed of its triumph.  But as Rowling told The Times,  &quot;if you really are honestly going to examine evil actions then you  have a moral obligation not to fudge the issue.&quot;  Her handling of  murder in this book is sensitive and not, I think, likely to engender  nightmares in young readers; as Rowling promised, it is &quot;upsetting but  not damaging.&quot;<br />I can't say the book was completely perfect.  Some  minor flaws exist: Harry innocently poses a question to which he should  well know the answer from a previous book; he convenient overlooks a  recently-learned spell that could easily resolve a certain difficulty; he  witnesses a magical effect in which the results come somewhat out of order.  In addition to noting these minor errors, I was a bit dissatisfied with  the way the ending of the year-long event was handled - I would have liked  a bit more pomp and ceremony and a bit more official attention to the  tragedy of the death that occurs.  However, I can see why Rowling ends the  year at Hogwarts on a quieter note than usual.  One very good result of  this is that Harry is given time and space to recover from his ordeals,  which is a refreshing change from the usual adventure series in which the  hero bounces from crisis to crisis with no time to absorb, reflect, or  grieve.<br />Time and re-reading will certainly offer me new perspectives on  &quot;The Goblet of Fire.&quot;  But meanwhile, I'm glad to say that this  is an excellent addition to the Harry Potter stories and one I will  certainly read again and again - while waiting eagerly for book five!

Having enjoyed fantasy and horror fiction all my life, this novel ranks with the best of them, in  children's or adult's fiction.  However, the climatic scene is as harrowing as anything I have ever read.  It is much  scarier than anything in the other Harry Potter books.  Lord Voldemort is  revealed in all his sadistic nature and I genuinely believe that this scene  could give nightmares to some kids.  Parents should make sure they read the  book with their kids, at least at this point, and preferably not just  before bedtime.  I did, and was sleepless for an hour -- and I'm 44 years  old!<br />That said, it was very well written, with the rich characters and  emotional development we've come to expect from the Harry Potter books.  Harry again displays all the virtues we'd like to see our own kids emulate  -- courage, unselfishness, generosity, loyalty, and persistence -- while  still being a normal human being with real problems.  It helps kids to know  that even a hero has to deal with envy, gossip, unfair authority figures,  friends who squabble, and unrequited crushes.<br />J.K. Rowling has  miraculously avoided making this series into a boring formula, like so many  book series for children.  She insists the characters grow and develop, and  in this novel she experiments with different points of view and a much  darker turn of events.  She explains many previously puzzling aspects of  the stories, then dangles a lot more to keep us interested.<br />Although  I'm a little worried about reading this to my 7-year old, I know I will.  We'll both look forward to the rest of the books in the series.	2000-07-11

The mystery of Voldemort's connections at Hogwarts  once again threw me off track -- I had picked one character to be the  baddie and it turned out to be someone else.

The climatic moments were . . .  SPELLBINDING.  Battles and tasks keep the reader on edge.  Once the story  gets going, it's nearly impossible to put down.  Rowling also moved  somewhat away from children's story form in this novel.  The Goblet of Fire  had much more foreshadowing, twists, turns, and romance than most  adolescent books.  The new love interests introduced make the story much  more fun to read, and give the reader more people to love, and to hate.

At over 700 pages, it is a tad long, especially for a young  reader, but Rowling proves once again that in the long run, slow and steady  proves to make an excellent story.  Plot and characters definitely deserve  the full five stars; however, the books massive length and slow spots make  it a daunting task for even many adult readers.	2000-07-11

All I can say is that the Harry Potter series is addicting.  Can I give it about 20 stars? I am almost 22 years old and I cannot seem to get enough of this series.  I applaud J.K. Rowling for treating children with respect and  knowing that they do not need to be talked down to in order to enjoy a  story.  Also thank you for letting adults get as wrapped up in the story  line as well.  I warn readers now, the last 50 pages of this book basically  gives you a new storyline...YOU WILL WANT BOOK 5 to be out as well!  That  is the key to success and Rowling has so accomplished that.	2000-07-11

Rowling's seven-book Harry Potter series is her best work yet.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in their fourth year at Hogwarts and facing many new and exciting challenges, including the  Triwizard Tournament, a competition between three schools of magic that  hasn't occurred for over a century.  The characters in the novel were more  believable than in the past three books and the plot was much more  entertaining, with lots of twists and turns that keep the reader on the  edge of their seat.  Although this book wasn't as cheerful and lighthearted  as the first and second books, it was still funny and immensely enjoyable.  Anyone who liked Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban won't be  disappointed.	2000-07-11

I am 20 years old and would never have thought of reading a &quot;childrens book&quot; if my sister had not waved the first volume in  front of my face and told me it was worth a look. So skeptically i picked  it up and was pulled into a world i have hardly ever been pulled into by a  book. The story was truly immersive. After finishing the first i had to  read the second and third. They only got better as the series went on. This  series of books is truly for all age groups though some children might need  help with the references/language that the books contain. When the fourth  installment came out i knew i had to buy it. I read it in the day that  followed and wish even now that i hadn't finished it so quickly. Waiting  for the next one will be an excrutiating task for I must know what happens  next. The Goblet of Fire is a pivotal book in the series. It outlines the  plot that will start to happen from now on. Rowlings Potter series is  truely captivating. They appeal to the inner child of us all and expand our  imaginations. I definitely recommend this title to anyone who is literate.  Now to wait the 11 months till the next book in the series comes out. It  will be a long wait might as well read the series over again =)	2000-07-11

I have read the other three Harry Potter books, and I loved all of them.  This book was no exception.  The plot was very interesting and suspenseful.  There are many twists that will keep you reading!  In this book Harry's  fight against the evil dark wizard, Voldemort, continues.  Many interesting  facts about Voldemort's past get revealed. This was by far the most  &quot;adult&quot; oriented book of the four Harry Potter books.  But I  believe that it is appropriate for all ages.  If this is your first  experience with Harry Potter I would recommend reading the other three  books first.  I think you could enjoy reading this book if you had never  read another Harry Potter book but a lot of the references to past books  would be lost.  However, J.K.

I was eagerly anticipating reading more of Harry's adventures on the Quidditch field and scrapes with danger as he continued his studies as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry.  However, I was not disappointed to find other players on the  Quidditch field in the book of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. <br />My  level of uneasiness grew as J.K.Rowling developed layer upon layer of  suspenseful episodes throughout Harry's fourth year.  I was not prepared  for the twist of events that unfurled as Harry met students from other  wizardry schools and events confirmed his suspicions of familiar  acquaintances.  The tempo of encounters with peril and you-know-who varied  just enough to keep me off guard.  I remain in awe of J.K. Rowling's  creative ability to draw readers into the magical world at Hogwarts.<br />Many  families have enjoyed previous Harry Potter books to read aloud together.   J.K. Rowling's art cleverly creates stressful environments in The Goblet of  Fire that may be too intense for some young readers.  My family was  thrilled to read a book with suspense, torture, mystery, and death, without  the prolonged gore and gristly details geared toward the older reader.   Parents will be sensitive to their own children's emotional development and  recognize that this book is for reading aloud after the little ones have  gone to bed.	2000-07-11

Rawlings produces another tale of daring and cunning as Harry starts his 4th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Lord  Voldemort, a dark wizard, stole Harry's parents away from him at the mere age of one, but could not manage to slay Harry with one of the three Unforgivable  Curses, Avada Kedavra, the Killing Curse.  The curse rebounds upon the evil  sorcerer and leaves him near death, while Harry is left with one souveneir,  a lightning bolt shaped scar upon his forehead.  Thirteen years later at  Hogwarts some new changes will affect Harry more than he could ever  imagine.  Harry is at home enjoying summer vacation as much as is possible  with his last surviving reletives, the Dursleys, when he recieves a letter  posted to him by the Weasley's, a wizarding family.  They ask Harry to  travel with them to the Quidditch World Cup.  Quidditch is a highly  dangerous wizarding game played 50 feet in the air on broomsticks, with  four balls and six hoops.  Harry obliges.  After the entertaining match the  Weasleys, Harry and another wizarding friend, Hermione Granger,walk back to  thier campsites. Meanwhile pandimonium breaks loose.  Lord Voldemorte's  followers, Death-Eaters, begin to wreak havoc throughout the campsite.  They have several Muggles or non-magic people suspended in midair.  Suddenly  a dark skeleton rises through the  air and people scream.  It is  the Dark Mark, the sign of Lord Voldemorte.  Several days later back  at school from the summer holidays Harry learns that instead of competing  in quidditch, students from two other magical schools Beauxbaton, and  Durstrang along with students attending Hogwarts with compete in a  dangerous competition the Triwizard Tournament.  The tournament has a high  risk fatctor for death.  One competeter from each of the three schools will  compete in the tournament to vie for the honor of being the Triwizard  Champion!

I could not sleep because of this book -- I had to know what was  going to happen to Harry, Ron and Hermoine.  Once I got this book, it was  difficult for me to put it down to go to work.  In this book, you see that  Harry and his friends are growing up.  Plus, J.K. Rowling gives us a few  more strands in the intrict web she is weaving.  One of the best parts of  this book is that we get to see almost everyone in a new light in some way  or another...  Another great feature in this book is new students from  other schools.  Upon first site, I was a little bit intimidated by the size  of the book -- over 700 pages, but by the end I wanted at least 700 more  pages.

Some of the mysteries in the past are cleared up and you are  given a better understanding of what happened during the days of  You-Know-Who's power and why Harry is made to suffer at the Dursley's house  all summer.  However, she created more mystery for the future. Rowling  warned us that this book is darker that the past and it is.  However, we  are starting to see Harry act like a teenager and the lighter moments of  being a teenager outweigh the darker ones.  We are given more of an insight  into the Weasley family and how they are a surrogate family for Harry.  By  being true to Harry, Rowling may be starting to lose some of her audience.  Harry is a teenager and certain things come with being a teenager.  I would  not recommend this book to anyone under ten.  As a teacher, some of the  suggestions that are made in this book, I would not want my third graders  reading.  Even though I know they will.  I see this being more of an issue  in the future books when Harry is 15 or 16.  There is enough of an ending  to close out the book.  Rowling is setting everything up for the showdown  between good and evil that we have been being prepared for since the first  book.  Rowling leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat wanting to know  what happens next.	2000-07-11

Book four is meant to be a culmination of the last 3 Potter  books, a service it renders quite nicely: Harry returns to Hogwarths with  his dear friends (and enemies) for his fourth year.  The legendary  Triwizard Tournaments is to take place, and Harry finds himself an  unwilling contestant -- and once again also finds himself the epicenter of  an ongoing battle between rising forces of evil and powerful forces of  good.<br />Rowling has a tight control over the plot, and just as importantly,  her imagination.  The world she has created is real enough for the  modern-day reader to empathize, yet far-enough removed that the book seems  something like exploration in a foreign country.  No detail -- the tiny  spastic owl, Pigwidgeon, Dudley's fatness, Fred and George's continued  antics -- fails to delight.  Rowling gives a nod to our social  sensibilities, by expanding the world of wizardry to include various  nationalities, while Hermione, armed with badges and a cause, embarks on  her own crusade to stamp out the world's injustice. Rowling gently reminds  us, too, of the vulnerability of young teenagers -- gawky boys discovering  girls, cheeky girls encountering their own feelings about love and  friendship.<br />Harry and his friends are growing up.  There is death, there  is evil, and there are serious matters a-brewin... as Harry learns more  about his past, we see that the lives of the various characters -- Harry,  Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Snape, Hagrid, Draco Malfoy, and Voldemort --  grow more intertwined.<br />Harry Potter is no longer just a boy, or a book,  or a series -- he's a movement.  And to miss out on this movement would be  a shame.  The audience can rest assured that Rowling has the story under  control. All that remains, once the book is read, is to reread it, analyze  it, discuss it, speculate, and wait for the return of Harry Potter in Book  5.  Reading it is only half the fun -- anticipation of what's to come is  the rest.once the book is read, is to reread it, analyze  it, discuss it, speculate, and wait for the return of Harry Potter in Book  5.

I thought it would drag out (I mean, 752 pages!)and the length just wouldn't work. I had no idea  the skill JK Rowling has. She took her characters and really added to their  life as witches and wizards. They, among other things, went to see the  Quidditch World Cup, which I found an exciting addition, and a part that  could even be a book itself, where the terror and intrigue you always find  in a Harry Potter book started, with the return of the terrible Death  Eaters, the followers of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. She described so vividly  their return, in a way that sent horrifying prickles down my spine, the  same way the first chapter, already bringing sudden deaths, did. But on a  lighter side, even though evilk always stalks Hogwarts, Harry, Hermione and  Ron, did begin to grow up, and found romance of sorts where they'd least  expect it . . . I don't want to give anything away, but the action, and the  danger with it, was unbelievable. Harry faces his greatest challenge yet,  in more ways then one. No one is who you think they are, and no one can be  trusted. A friend may not be, and an enemy might change. The ending was  troubling, and left us wondering what is to become of the not-so-perfect  life of the wizarding community. It left me with an unsettled feeling that  something's just not right, and left me wanting to know more. But even as  secrets are left, many are revealed. The mystery of Herry's parents is  told, and you learn something rather startling about one of Harry's close  friends, Neville. Although this was certainly the darkest of all of her  books, I feel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was definitely a success.  If you read one book this summer, I would definitely recommend it to be  this one, no matter how old you are. This will appeal to kids and grown-ups  alike.	2000-07-11

Although my nine-year-old was simply vibrating with excitement, I was worried. What if this one wasn't as good as the first three?  What if J.K.  Rowling was now simply writing a book because she had to for contract  reasons, not because she had a story that had to be told?  Happily that is  not the case at all, and this latest installment in the Harry Potter saga  is fresh, often exhilarating and sure to please anyone who has come to love  the magic of Harry, Hogwarts and all things that are not of the Mugglekind.  That being said, even those with no experience of the first three books  will find it readable because Ms. Rowling offers up enough background to  make it understandable yet without disclosing too many of the secrets of  the first stories. It almost literally starts with a bang as  Harry's  friends the Weasly's blast through a wall in the suburban house where Harry  lives with his hopelessly muggle (non-magical) aunt, uncle and cousin. From  that point on having to put this book down can be like having to jump from  a moving car; you just want to hold on until the ride is over!  There are  lots of interesting and funny details about the differences between the  lifestyles of the muggle and magical kind.  From camping in a pup tent that  on the inside actually is a one bedroom apartment complete with mismatched  chairs and smelling of cats to practical jokes that involve cream tarts  that temporarily turns the eater of one into a giant yellow canary!  There  is also Voldemort, the Dark Lord.  He who was so powerful in the dark arts  and so evil that wizards and witches refer to him fearfully as  You-Know-Who, even years after he had lost all his power in an attempt to  murder one year old Harry.  Harry has had to do battle with the Dark Lord  and his minions a number of times since that first attack that left a  lightening shaped scare on his forehead and his parents dead.  In The  Goblet of Fire, the Dark Lord is back and he is stronger and more dangerous  than ever.  Harry is older and wiser at fourteen but also prone to the  trials and tribulations of that age.  A time fraught with  misunderstandings, a first crush, self doubts mistakes, and betrayals.  This is reflected in the darker tone of the story, there are great  victories but there is also great loss.  Ms. Rowling successfully carries  off this darker nature with respect and care for both her characters and  her readers. This is a fantasy but it is also a mystery, to respect that,  there is much that should not be said it.  What can be said, is that it  will not disappoint.  There are all the necessary elements of wonder and  close calls and plenty of humour and excitement, and it leaves the reader  with a promise of the adventures to come.  It is a good book for older  kids, eight or nine and up and for adults too.  It is an especially good  book for a child and adult to share.Goblet of Fire, the Dark Lord is back and he is stronger and more dangerous  than ever.

Rowling's Harry Potter books. A wonderful friend who happens to be a 3rd and 4th-grade teacher convinced me to put down my usually more adult pursuits for a change of  pace in the Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. I was instantly enamored  with the simple, yet crisp dialogue. The first 3 books were extremely quick  reads, yet they don't feel the least bit disposable. Even though I had only  started with the books a month ago, I felt totally immersed, so I (and my  friend) eagerly awaited the new, 4th book in the series. Rowling noted that  this book would be darker than the others, including an actual death in one  of its chapters, albeit to a rather peripheral character. This, in addition  to the revelation that Goblet of Fire would be longer than 700 pages, may  have scared some away, but most of the plot threads are very engrossing,  compelling, and in the end, necessary to move the series away from  potentially becoming formulaic.<br />As I read most of the book on a public  beach, I found numerous people asking me what the differences were between  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and the previous books. I explained the  relative lack of Quidditch action, at which point I also mentioned the fact  that &quot;there are plenty of other types of action to keep your  attention&quot;.  Most readers can see certain threads developing as the  main characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione) become older and more mature  (teenagers), so it's nice to see the characters grow with many of the  reading audience. It was nice to see less of the Dursleys, the Muggle  family who raised Harry, because they were rather one-dimensional and  predictable. Professor Dumbledore's role becomes more and more clear, as do  the roles of some of the other Professors. However, there is a bit of fat  in the story that could be cut. A sub-plot involving house-elves never  really generated steam. The political correctness of it felt a bit out of  place. The Quidditch action here isn't quite as captivating as it was in  Prisoner of Azkaban.  In the end, a very satisfying read, though it took  about twice as long. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire answers quite a  few questions, but poses so many more. It is a fitting midpoint for the  series, and dutifully sets up the remaining 3 (according to Rowling) books.  It works along the same lines as a certain episode in the Star Wars series.  However, I would not recommend jumping straight into Goblet of Fire without  reading the first 3 books, as readers of the entire will be richly rewarded  with the various references and nods in GoF.f  place.

The begining starts off a little slow because, well...since it is the  &quot;middle&quot; of the set, JKR wanted it to stand out and be a little  different. Near the middle of the book, you have come across the 'Triwizard  Tournament'(Which I think the book should have been called...) The  Triwizard Tournament is a tournament of events against duling wizarding  schools.You will probably notice some of those little &quot;crushes&quot;  going on. In the HP world, there seems to be a nice &quot;love  Hexagon&quot; going on.Yes, that many people! Now later on, I must say the  ending is wonderful! Even the begining of the end is wonderful, in it's  scary sorta way. Overall, it was a great book, but I would reccomend it to  anybody over 10. I give it this because JKR seemed to have used swears a  little more in this book not to mention a rather funny sick joke made my  Ron(hehe..it's not that sick..). Plus the ending might freak little kids  out because..well, I can't tell you! That would give away the story! And if  you want to find out how great the ending is, go read it!	2000-07-11

I don't think I've ever stayed up until 20 to 4 to finish a book before, but finish it I did, and the result was an interesting combination of emotions.  With her  monster of a novel breaking sales records all over the world, J.K. Rowling  has created a novel in which the ends don't get tied up into a neat little  package.  This one is different. Don't get me wrong, that is not a bad  thing.  This book still has the endearing characters, the hilarious  one-liners, and the gripping story lines that made the first three books in  the series so wonderful.  But the darker side to Harry's world becomes far  more apparent in this one.  You begin to question whether Harry will  continue to escape danger and defeat evil.  I, for one, began to fear for  the lives of my favourite characters.  It is so unusual to find this sort  of emotion in a children's book, and yet the children will still read it.  And so will the adults.  This book is full of fun, adventure, suspense,  humour, and more of the little tidbits of information about the wizarding  world that now characterizes Rowling's novels.  We see familiar faces and  meet some new ones.  But there is much more than that.  Harry now faces  death, fear, pain, and evil unlike any he has ever faced before.  But  thanks to the unstoppable writing of Rowling, he manages to face his  challenges with the same courage and strength that we have come to expect  from our beloved Harry.	2000-07-11

Rowling's fourth installment in the Harry Potter series may be long, but the story needs to be told slowly and in detail. Described in interviews as the &quot;pivotal 4th book&quot;, the novel proves that  description to be an understatement. Although at times I wondered if  anything major was ever going to happen, I knew that Rowling was  meticulously setting up her readers for something unexpected to occur at  some critical point. It does. The pace of the book may be slower than that  of the first three in the series, but throughout I kept wondering who the  evil ones truly were, and how the book was going to end which contributed  to it being a page-turner nonetheless. &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; reads  more like a good mystery novel rather than an enchanting children's  fantasy. And well it should: Harry is growing up and becoming more and more  aware of the reality of his life in the world of wizardry. Therefore, the  style and themes are somewhat more mature. Towards the end the book does  turn frightening and younger readers may have trouble sleeping at night.  However, the major turning point in the book is cleverly timed as it comes  upon you without warning. It did scare and shock me. When I closed the back  cover at last, I most certainly found myself eagerly looking forward to  Year Five of Harry Potter's school career. Well done again, Ms. Rowling; in  spite of what some critics may say, your books have much to say about  society, right and wrong, and good and evil.	2000-07-11

As sequels come and go--this one was one of the best. So good, I finished most of it the night it came in the mail. The most striking thing about it is its darkness. There is, of course, the humor and clever bits, that are  synonimous with the name J.K. Rowling, and yet, there is a side which  sobered me and made me think--as only Heller, Tolstoy, Hardy, and writers  of that ilk can. So, I guess, in a way, J.K. Rowling has joined their  ranks. Kudos to her! Not only does she pack in a rollicking story, she  manages to tell a story of morals without sounding like a minister.  It  did, however, make me very misty-eyed at times, but read it everybody  should--both the young and old. As old Dumbledore himself explained,  &quot;...they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my  belief, however, that the truth is generally perferable to lies...&quot;	2000-07-11

Would it be as wonderful as the first three?  Thankfully, it just about was.<br />My 'just about' comes for a number of reasons.  This novel had all  the colorful characters and entertaining words that we have come to expect  from J.K. Rowling.  Too, the challenges Harry and his friends face are  refreshingly original.  We get to learn more about the other characters of  the school, including Hagrid and Snape.  We also get to meet other wizards  and witches Harry's age who are as interesting as they are  unique.<br />Unfortunately, we have to hear all about how Harry became a  wizard and who his awful family is for the fourth time and counting.  Rowling should take a hint from Anne McCaffrey and include a prologue for  those few people who are reading number four (or five or six) before having  read the first novels.  That way those of us who have read the same history  over and over again could finally just skip it.<br />This fourth in a series  of seven books seems to have leaned more towards sci-fi at the end.  No  longer are all the characters seemingly immortal.  Also, Rowling has  painted a darker picture that may disturb younger readers.  Voldemort and  the acts he engages in are rather disturbing, and they leave us with no  doubt that in the future Rowling will be mixing in some more of this  darkness.<br />On a lighter note, I must say that while I thought I had  everything all figured out, Rowling suprised me yet again with her creative  conclusion (which I should have suspected, but never did.)<br />So, I loved  this book, but I fear that the size and overall darkness prevelant towards  the end will be a bit overwhelming for some children.  The character  development is superb, and Rowling's ability to explain things that I never  thought to question is delightful.	2000-07-11

Rowling tries to show Harry and  his friends as they move through adolescence, attempting to deal with their  parents as well as their first crushes; however, any pre-teen novel out  there does it better.

With thrilling action beginning at the Quidditch World cup, and continuing during the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, we at  last get to see a bit of the wizarding world beyond the walls of Hogwarts.  The view is not a dissappointment.  You-Know-Who is back, and more evil  then ever-keeping readers on the edge of their seats through all 734 (!)  pages. Our favorite characters are growing up, and the romance quotant,  though low-key, adds a new spark as well. Expect to find some interresting  information about everyone's favorite groundkeeper, and a certain escaped  convict will return to be part of the action. The book is a turning point  in the series, and for Harry Potter, the excitement, the danger, and the  stakes have never been higher.	2000-07-11

That is not true of the fourth book, Goblet of Fire, what Rowling has called the 'pivotal book' in her  seven book series. This is no loss to Potter fans. Indeed, Rowling assumes  her readers have an easy familarity with the first books (the characters,  the scenes, the drama, even specific curses and potions)and is able,  consequently, to write a book of greater depth, excitement, and edification  than the first three.<br />A la the Brothers Karamazov, Rowling's lead trio of  Harry, Hermione, and Ron represent the three faculties of soul: spirit,  mind, and body. The first three Potter books are the integration of these  faculties in the good. Their friendship, as the perfectly formed soul in  life by the world, is forged by trials, failures, and victories in the  struggle with evil. The success of the books has as much to do with the  identification each reader has with this universal experience as with  Rowling's unique wit and story telling skills.<br />In the fourth book, this  loving trinity has matured enough to begin its heroic journey into the  valley of darkness. I assume this journey will last the remaining three  books and end with the victory of the white hats (Albus Dumbledore)and the  salvation of Neville Longbottom (the character who will be transformed from  a toad to a world beater by the sacrificial love of his three friends). Not  since Dickens has an author in English, in the guise of a comic novel or  fantasy literature ('children's books')written a work that because of its  un-reality so successfully engages and transforms for the better the reader  with its portrayal of what is most real: love, loyalty, courage,  friendship, and the danger of the absence of these virtues in all those who  choose death ('Vol-de-mort')over life. These are the most implicitly and  subtle Christian novels since the Narnia books (and perhaps because of the  author's much more subtle use of Christian imagery and theology)they are  more successful than Lewis' work both in the bookstores and in souls  immunized to the faith of Christians.<br />To end: An altogether wonderful  read I urge all parents to share aloud with their children and friends;  more edifying than a Sunday visit to most places of congregational worship  and a whole lot more fun.f the  author's much more subtle use of Christian imagery and theology)they are  more successful than Lewis' work both in the bookstores and in souls  immunized to the faith of Christians.<br />To end: An altogether wonderful  read I urge all parents to share aloud with their children and friends;  more edifying than a Sunday visit to most places of congregational worship  and a whole lot more fun.	2000-07-11

She paints a more richly-colored world in which the characters which we have come to know and love reveal much more about  themselves (and others reveal about them - a new character, a Hedda  Hopper-like journalist who has a penchant for trashing her subjects), as a  result of which we are all better prepared for the inevitable conflicts to  come.  We get to know the Weasleys better than ever; important facts about  Dumbledore, Snape, the Death Eaters, Voldemort and others are revealed and  woven more deeply into the fabric of the life of Harry Potter and his  growing up.  The book is long only because the story is richly detailed.  The details are essential I am sure, not only for the plot in Book 4, but  as a foundation for the last three stories.  Long, however, does not mean  boring . . . in fact, the opposite.  Harry's latest year at Hogwarts is his  most challenging yet.

Writing this personal review after finishing the book on July 10, I believe that the people that spoke about  &quot;commercial hype&quot; must be realizing their mistake when confronted  with the reality of Ms. Rowling work. Harry Potter books sell not by virtue  of advertising or marketing, but because they are simply excellent and the  author does her job without concessions to fame or to expectations. The  result is a powerful work that can be read at multiple levels.<br />In  &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot;, we not only see Harry Potter, involved in  old activities and new teenage interests, described with plenty of  imagination and humor. We are also made aware that his call and destiny  only started the day that he and his mother defeated Voldemort. There is  still a long way to go for Harry, more dangerous and complex as time goes  by, a way in which he will likely grow in wisdom and comprehension. And he  will not be alone in that path; in this book, the figures of Ron, Hermione,  Dumbledore, Hagrid and so many others become more fundamental and close.  Harry is not a solitary hero, he is in fact the center of a community full  of ethical values, frienship and heart-warming solidarity. A world  confronted with evils that are somehow the mirror image of some troubles on  our day to day world.<br />The reader of all ages will find material for fun  and though on this book, a classic on its own, beyond any literary critic.	2000-07-11

I just could not put it down.<br />The first chapter recalls  that of the first Harry Potter book.  The reader is introduced to  disturbing plot information before focusing on Harry' summer with the  Dursley's.  Harry's scar is hurting again as Voldemort refuses to die.  In  this novel, Voldemort is present throughout, as opposed to making a brief  appearance at the end.  This does not bode well for Harry.<br />Rowling  addresses the issue of wizards and witches  outside of England and Hogwarts  with the raucous Quidditch World Cup and the unheard of before Tournament  of Champions.  This tournament keeps the reader on the edge of their seat  as we wait to see what challenge will be faced next.<br />The fourth novel  definitely has a darker note than the previous three.  Voldemort is present  throughout, and the Ministry of Magic is shown to be as flawed as any  government.  Harry is coming of age, and Rowling no longer treats him as a  precocious boy.  He must deal with the problems of becoming a man; but,  luckily, he has his godfather, Sirius, to help him.<br />I would not dare  spoil the ending for any Harry fans.  I will say, though, that Harry  Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts ends nothing like his first three years.  I hope J.K.

Each year as I finished the last book in the series I would  morn that I had once again run out of Narnian magic to read. Not since I  last finished the Chronicles have I felt such despair and longing, for last  night I finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. After  &quot;discovering&quot; the works of Rowling just a few short weeks ago I  have been able to think of nothing other than Harry. As soon as I finished  one book, I purchased the next in the series. I finished book three just in  time to stand in line to purchase book four the day it was released. I was  thrilled to see that the fourth installment was twice as long as the other  books as I knew this book would have to hold me over until book 5 comes  out.<br />In The Goblet of Fire Rowling continues the captivating story of  Harry in much the same fashion as the other books.

In this first dream we get a hint of the dark  things that await Harry and his world. Dark things do happen to Harry in  this installment (the meeting of Harry and Voldermort is particularly  breathtaking), but we are treated to rich and interesting new characters  and wonderful story telling before the incredible climax.

Not only is Harry Potter and  the Goblet of Fire entertainment and enjoyable for children, but it is also  great for their education.  In this book, Harry's scar, which is shaped  like a lightning bolt, starts hurt again.  Everyone knows that when Harry's  scar hurts, trouble is not too far behind.  The night that Harry's scar  hurt, was the night that he had a dream about You-Know-Who and his  sidekicks planning to kill Harry.  Who knows whats going to happen?  I do.  And if you want to find out what happens to Harry and the gang, I suggest  that you go on the internet, log on to Amazon.com, and order Harry Potter  and the Goblet of Fire.	2000-07-11

I've been counting down the days till July 8, rereading the first three books, and hoping the fourth would live up to all the anticipation.  Well, it does - it's the best in the series so far.  There's much more depth to  the supporting characters - I especially like the subplots for Ron and  Hermione - and the villains are even more menacing.  It's more frightening  than the earlier books, but then, even &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; had  some truly chilling moments.  &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; simply has more  frequent and more extended passages revealing the treachery of Voldemort  and his followers.  It makes you realize how important it is for Harry and  his friends to fight the dark powers and master their own power so they  can, hopefully, finally triumph in Book 7.<br />I really like how Rowling is  beginning to tie the book together in the series - characters and themes  from earlier books reappear, making it clear how well-thought-out the  series is, and the ending leaves you eagerly awaiting Book 5, wanting to  see how the plot strands will continue to evolve.  The ending is satisfying  in its own right - Rowling doesn't leave you hanging, just lets you know  that, just as in real life, everything doesn't get wrapped up all at once.<br />This may be a children's fantasy novel, but it's as well written, as  thought-provoking, and, oddly enough, as realistic as anything I've ever  read.  (I'm 25 and have an English degree and I'm not embarassed to say the  Harry Potter books are among my favorite works, certainly in English in  this century.)  While there's magic aplenty, the emotions of the characters  as they face their problems are almost painfully real.  Rowling's  evocations of the trials of early adolescences - first crushes, bullies,  awkward growth spurts, school dances - are remarkably true to life, and  made me care even more for the characters as they fought their magical  problems as well.<br />This is a wonderful book for anyone 10 and up; it might  be too complex and sometimes too frightening for younger children.  Sure,  it's long; sure, it's got many interweaving plot strands; but I think that  only makes it better for children and teens.  It's refreshing to see a book  that doesn't underestimate the intelligence and reading ability of young  people.  And any adult who dismisses the series because it's written for  children is missing some wonderful writing; any adult who dismisses this  book, in particular, is missing some of the finest plotting and  characterization I've seen, as well as a truly exciting adventure.<br />Well,  now I'm going to go re-read the entire series so far, and start counting  down till Book 5.

I'm not going to spoil the story for those of you who haven't yet read the book, but this book is vast and I'm afraid, following on from the previous books it was a bit too much for me. Having bought the other three books only a month ago, I read them all very quickly.  The first two I greatly  enjoyed, reading them on sequential days.  The third took a bit longer,  firstly because it seemed less exciting - it had too many twists in the  plot but less coherence - and the whole atmosphere was much darker.  The  fourth book seems to have moved even further in this vein as Rowling's  publishers happily admit.<br />I should emphasise that I am an adult reader,  and these books are, of course, aimed at children. Furthermore, having read  all four in such short succession increased the possibility of  &quot;saturation&quot;, so maybe I am being a little unfair. It's just that  despite, or maybe because of, the first two books' being such good  adventures, I feel that the formula isn't so well suited to sequels as CS  Lewis's Narnia series or the (admittedly very different short stories of)  Richmal Crompton's Just William series, and certainly not to sequels that  are ever larger and more convoluted.<br />That said, anyone who can get  millions of children  away from their Nintendos, Playstations etc and  reading books deserves a round of applause!<br />Sorry	2000-07-11

I am an adult, and yet I spent the better part of the last two days stealing time to read [and, yes, finish (it isn't short)]this book. Harry Potter is not the world's greatest wizard- J.K. Rowling is. Only magic can explain her ability to deliver a book as satisfying as  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,&quot; in the face the enormous  pressure, hype, and expectations that built up to it. No mere mortal could  have pulled it off.  Though HPatGoF starts somewhat slowly with a  prologue, it quickly regains momentum with a return visit with the Weasleys  followed by the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. Rowling's  trademark imaginative touches are everywhere: team color badges that scream  the players' names, flags that play their national anthems when waved, and  action figures that are really active.  After that we're back to the fourth  year at Hogwarts where Harry is chosen as its representative in the  Triwizard Tournament against rival schools Durmstrang and Beaux-batons.  Of  course, the threat of Voldemort shrouds the proceedings leading up to a  thrilling wand duel that will not disappoint even the most avid Robin Hood,  Star Wars, or Three Musketeers fans.  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is a worthy successor to  the three books that came before it.  It entertains and instructs, and in a  world where real-life heroes are often less than heroic it provides role  models for kids of all ages. I eagerly await book five.	2000-07-11

Miraculously, JK Rowling has kept it up. The fourth installment of the Harry Potter series is at  least as good as the previous novels if not better. While the book does  start out considerably slower than the others and takes it's own sweet time  getting to any real action, my opinion overall is that the world has itself  another good read. The book  was certainly &quot;more dark&quot; as promised and I enjoyed the fact that  the author did become more &quot;ruthless&quot; with the plot. For once,  the book does not end on an upbeat note -- a nice change from the  &quot;wonder kid fights dark lord, wonder kid wins&quot; arrangement for  the previous three and a vital movement to keep the entire series from  becoming essentially monotonous. Overall, no masterpiece -- but another  engaging story with the usual &quot;didn't see that coming...&quot;  conclusion. Happy Reading!<br />-- Alia	2000-07-11

Rowlings is planning a series of seven Harry Potter books, making &quot;Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire&quot; the pivotal Book 4.  And pivotal it is.  In the first three, Lord Voldemort is weak and almost  powerless, but we know that his &quot;faithful servant&quot; Wormtail has  headed off to find him at the end of Book 3.  We are also promised that he  will come back with a vengeance.  And that he does.<br />If Harry thought he  was going back for a business-as-usual fourth year at Hogwart's, then he's  in for a surprise.  But surprises are business as usual at Hogwart's,  aren't they?  From the Quidditch Cup Finals to the Third Task of the  Triwizard Tournament, Harry and his friends are in for another year of high  flying and deep diving adventures.<br />And nestled among all the brave  rescues and fearless flying is a little bit of romance for our fourth year  students.  We relive our own awkward moments of finding a date as Ron and  Harry try to find dance partners for the Yule Ball.  And then they find out  that maybe there has been a beautiful girl right under their noses all the  time.<br />But always underlying the festive holidays and trips to Hogsmeade  is the question:  Why is Harry in the Triwizard Tournament?  Who entered  his name, and to what end?  As usual, we are kept guessing to the end, and  no matter what you think, you will be surprised.  Once again, Harry will  come face to face with his mortal enemy, Lord Voldemort, but with three  books left in the series, we know there will be more to come.  The book  ends with a greater sense of anticipation than the other three have.  There  is no doubt that the Dark Lord is back!<br />If the book has any fault, it is  when it uses contrived means to reveal things in the past that we need to  know.  Harry spends some time in Professor Dumbledore's thoughts, the sole  purpose of which is to reveal past events.  Then later, an accomplice of  the Dark Lord is given truth serum, and through his narration, the pieces  of the puzzle begin to fit together.  It would have been nice if events  could have led to inevitable conclusions, or just a few questions asked to  bring us up to speed.  Unfortunately, there is just so much going on in  this book, it would have been hard to accomplish that task without using  the methods employed.<br />The book is over 700 pages long and therefore one  is forced to put it down at some point, but finding that point is always  difficult.

This is one of only hundreds of things that happen to  Harry, Hermani, and Ron in this latest installment. Definitely an excellent  read, for adults as well as children. I could not put it down, and had to  fight with my son over who's turn it was to sit and read. The entire Harry  Potter series has opened a whole new world of reading to thousands of  children, my own included! Although the subject matter is a tad scary, and  the book is very long, over 700 pages, it will not deter even the youngest  fan of the series from reading it from cover to cover, no matter how long  it takes! The only draw back to this book; that we will have to wait over a  year to find out what happens to Harry at his 5th year in Wizarding School!	2000-07-11

She has carefully woven threads from  earlier novels into this book, and continued the suspense that grows more  and more intricate with each novel.  The Triwizard Tournament was  masterfully crafted and executed, and the appearance of the two oldest  Weasley brothers rounded out the family portrait. Rowling has definitely  demonstrated that her novels grow more mature with her characters. This one  clearly appeals to an older audience, although I am sure the younger Harry  Potter fans are giving it their best spell.	2000-07-11

I was full of hopes that I didn't have to liken it to such hyped up disasters such as  &quot;Godzilla&quot; or even the Titanic. I came out of reading this book  having sufficietly answered my question. And I would have to say  &quot;yes&quot; this book was worth the hype preceding it.This book at 640  pages is the longest children's book ever printed. However, this is only  one among multiple records that Harry, along with his friends at Hogwarts  have broken. This book comes in the middle of Harry's education at  Hogwarts, and also the middle of Rowling's proposed series of seven books  depicting Harry's education and life at Hogwarts and in the magical world  (one book for each year of his education at Hogwarts school of witchcraft  and wizadry). And this book, where Harry is 14 signalls the turning point  for this series.This is the book where Harry discovers hormones (and Ron  discovers that Hermione is a member of the opposite sex)and where the death  of a well established character comes to pass. This book dfinitely stands  out from the previous three volumes of Harry Potter. The first three books  all followed the pattern where the fist chapter tells us how Harry is  getting on with the Dursleys (a muggle family that harry is most  unfortunately related to)and how he has managed to get by during the long  two summer months spent with them. And where the last chapter always closes  with Harry very happy after another year full of triumphs over evil at  school. If you were expecting to find a similar pattern in this book, you  may be surprised. I will not reveal the plot except to say that it is more  intricate than ever before and less fairytale-like (in the sense that they  live happily ever after)than the other books.This truly is a book worth  reading. However, This book left me feeling rather depleted in a way none  of the other booksdid. This is probably because the conclusions that I had  drawn as to who was the &quot;baddie&quot; were proved to be very wrong or  possibly because I had invested so much of my time into reading it and had  become so entwined in the wonderful world of Harry Potter that I felt at a  loss of what to do next when I found the book to be finished. I cannot wait  until the arrival of the next book in a years time and hope that, as the  others have got lengthier as they went on (the first book being 223pages  long, the second 251 and the third 317)that the next book will exceed 640  pages. Hope springs eternal!	2000-07-11

The story is a bit darker and more intense, but nothing out of the ordinary for Harry; the books are just progressing naturally.<br />The plot line is even more complex than that of Azkaban (in the hands of a lesser writer, it would be unwieldy) but it ties up just as neatly as Azkaban and leaves just enough threads loose to force the reader to thought of inventing a time machine to travel foward to the release of the next book.  I don't want to give anything away, except to say that old friends return and nothing is what it seems (but you knew that... it is Harry's world!).<br />If the books keep getting better, I will have to send Rowling a request- lend me some money, because I'm up so late reading your books, I can't make it to work (or classes).

Harry Potter's newest adventure certainly lives up to the previous three books by Rowling.  All of Harry's familiar troubles, including Malfoy and Snape, as well as some new crisis appear.  As Hagrid says to him,  &quot;It's always something with you Harry&quot;.  However, there's a  slight difference in this year's story, Harry's growing up.  Not only have  he and Ron noticed that Hermione is a girl, there are others at Hogwarts  causing all sorts of butterflies in Harry's stomach.  Instead of the day  to day type of story that Rowling used with the first three books, The  Goblet of Fire focuses on one big event that affects Harry throughout the  year.  Altogether, it reminds the reader that sometimes bad things happen  and the hero doesn't always win, but the triumph is in continuing on.  I  highly recommend this to all Harry Potter readers, and can't wait for year  5.	2000-07-11

Also, whereas in the  other books Voldemort is never really described in detail, in the Goblet of  Fire his malice can truly be sensed. The Goblet of Fire, following in the  tradition of Philip Pullman, leaves an amazing cliffhanger at the end  making sure that the reader will read the next book the second it comes  out.

Despite the hype, it is as much fun and as touching, shocking, and poignant as the first three. Many postive messages for kids about doing the right thing, keeping friends, and friendly competition as well as some serious messages about prejudice, jealousy, and envy. This book feels less like Roald Dahl and CS Lewis and more like STAR WARS -- THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.<br />Book four starts off at the Quidditch World Cup; This event is the only time we will see the sport in this text as the year long in-school tournament is cancelled in favor of a three wizard-school magic championship open only to older students. Of course Harry, officially too young to enter, has been entered against his will and finding out who is behind it is the main mystery behind this book. Rowling also takes an interest in showing Ron, Hermione, and Harry growing up as their \\"teen\\" personalities assert themselves and their interests change and tempers flare. There is a welcome return of several characters from the previous books and much of the mystery, history, and politics of the wizarding world Harry has entered is explored and explained as well as how the world was before the infant Harry stopped Voldemort.<br /> The outcome of this book sets up the possible direction the final three books will probably take and hints at a great shakeup among the characters both liked and disliked as well as a future culminating grand battle between good and evil as the climax of the series. I am sure we will probably lose more characters in future books as this one ends both tragically and ominously. Things are only beginning. Cant wait for book 5.	2000-07-11

There are elements of Willy Wonka in the more  serious Albus Dumbledore and Fred and George, the Weasley twins who love  playing pranks. Dudley Dursley surely follows in the footsteps of spoiled  brats Veruca Salt and Mike Teevee, while Harry shows a few similarities to  Charlie and James of James and the Giant Peach. Of all the books in the  Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is probably my  favorite, in that it covers a lot of ground and has more emotional range  than the others. I wish that I could have read this from a child's  perspective, but since that's not possible, I can say that it offers plenty  of fun for those adults who need fantasy just as much as children. This is  an ideal book for adults to share with youngsters, including sports-minded  kids (who will love reading about the Quidditch World Cup) and those who  like blood and guts and normally have a hard time sitting down to read. The  pace and sense of adventure never lets up, and there is more of a sense of  profundity and darkness throughout the novel. Harry's encounters with Lord  Voldemort and his tests during the Triwizard contest echo the fact that  Harry is beginning to grow up, test himself and figure out what he believes  and where he fits into the world. Like her previous books, J.K. Rowling's  new one has numerous references that poke fun at pop culture, human vanity  and bureaucratic politics within the framework of the wizard's world (One  of my favorite references is a book entitled &quot;Men Who Love Dragons Too  Much.&quot;) Her evocative names and verbal sleight-of-hand are a constant  joy. There's good humor throughout, and Harry is shown as a boy whose  courage goes hand-in-hand with selflessness in looking out for his friends  and schoolmates, who in the book take the place of his family. Children's  literature is tremendously important in shaping what children believe, and  the main characters of Harry, Hermione and Ron are shown with all their  imperfections, funny foibles and jealousies, which merely serve to  emphasize their underlying fidelity toward and love for each other  throughout the growing pains of early adolescence. In short, I would highly  recommend this book (and this series) for anyone who wants to leave reality  for a while and become acquainted with a fantastic, magical, yet strangely  down-to-earth world where the fundamental battle of good vs. evil is  leavened with humor and love.whose  courage goes hand-in-hand with selflessness in looking out for his friends  and schoolmates, who in the book take the place of his family.

I was one of the few to stumble upon an extra copy lying in a bookstore after the books had hit the shelves on the 8th.  I bought it ASAP, and read it that night, in one sitting.  If you had been paying attention to the  reports that a major character dies, and that Harry begins to like a girl,  they are all true, but it is not as predominant in the book as I expected,  which in my opinion made it the same sorta tale that Harry Potter has  always told.  While the story was good, and there was still some funny  scenes, the book seemed a tad generic.  I still loved the book, and all  Harry Potter fans need to buy this and read it, and those who haven't read  the Harry Potter books, should read them all. There was some major  character developments, and scenes that all seemed to be pointing to a  wonderful finale of the series.  The cliffhanger ending makes me wish that  the 5th book was coming out along with this one, and I cannot wait till its  release.  I liked it!	2000-07-11

When I was a kid, I read every &quot;Famous Five&quot; book and they all had the same structure: a group of friends could hardly wait for the start of their vacations, where the most wonderful things happened. Now I read the Harry Potter books and I see it all again reflected in a mirror: a group of friends can hardly wait for their vacations to end and their classes to begin, because there's where all the fun and adventure begin. Both the &quot;Famous Five&quot; and the Harry Potter books are great, but the point is that this fundamental difference between them tells us more about the way the society changed than a bunch of sociological studies.

When I first picked up the book, and realized how heavy and long it was, I was scared that the book would  tend to just in some places, but to my surprise, the excitement only keeps  building, and makes you feel like you can't put the book down until you've  finished it.  The main characters are much more devolped in this book, and  are starting to grow up, especially Ron- we start to see him openly jealous  of Harry's constant spotlight, and openly shameful of being poor.  And  Harry, Ron, and Hermione all start to see the opposite sex as more as just  friends (especially Ron and Harry).  The book is darker and more adult then  the previous three, and I have a feeling that there will be some  controversy about these books being too scary for younger kids (which I can  assure, there will be scared stiff.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in the fantastically successful Harry Potter series. I've read all four, and, by far, was most impressed with this one. As usual, Rowling gives us some  hilarious insight on the Dursley family as Harry eagerly awaits his fourth  year at Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches. Harry's fantastic  adventures lead him into the Triwizard Tournament, one of the most  rewarding-and deadly-challenges in wizarding history. Harry and just a few  others from other wizarding schools must complete three tasks in order to  claim the title of Triwizard Champion.<br />Harry is also allowed a  once-in-a-lifetime chance to attend the Quiddich World Cup! The excitement  doesn't stop there-Harry has the best seats in the stadium at the Top  Box.<br />Harry's anxiety is not limited to only the tournament, however.  Harry's lightning-shaped scar has begun to hurt every once in a while, a  pain that Harry remembers only when Lord Voldemort was near him. Could this  mean that You-Know-Who is finally returning to wreak havoc and revenge on  Muggles and wizards alike? Or is Harry's scar just randomly causing him a  little pain during dreams? Strange signs begin to arise, such as the rise  of the supposedly vanished Death Eaters and the Dark Mark..but you can only  find out by reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br />I've read all of  Rowling's books, and none have disappointed. This book is no exception, and  I thoroughly enjoyed every page. I strongly recommend that you read it.	2000-07-11

I finished devouring the fourth Harry Potter book nine hours (and a few gasps of fresh air) after it arrived on my doorstep from a Ryder truck.  (Apparently FedEx had so many orders to deliver from Amazon on July 8 that  it had to rent moving trucks to deliver them all!)<br />The Goblet of Fire  begins with a (heart-thumping) teaser chapter, revealing both a murder and  Voldemort himself.  For the next several hundred pages, however, Rowling  settles back into the more familiar rhythms of life at Hogwarts (albeit  with a new and exciting Triwizard Tournament involving foreign schools).  The outcomes of each competition in the Tournament are unfortunately not  too hard to fathom (gee, I wonder who's the best wizard of them all?), but  the suspenseful and explosive conclusion of the Tournament makes up for any  shortcomings.  The fourth book reminds me a lot of Azkaban in its structure  -- a mostly &quot;mundane&quot; -- if that's posssible for a book about  wizards -- (but very interesting) storyline for the bulk of the book, and  an AMAZING conclusion that knocks your electrifying Dobby-knitted socks  off!<br />Even though the book was thicker than my copy of War and  Peace(! ), it kept my eyeballs riveted and attention devoted to almost  every word.  The fourth book is studded with richly-described characters  (from Ludo Bagman to Mad-Eye Moody) and hilarious subplot strands (such as  Hermione's House-Elf Liberation Front).  The book also contains  surprisingly moralistic (but very convincing and at times touching) lessons  -- about the evils of bigotry, the dangers of bad parenting, the importance  of loyalty, and playing fair.  From ethics and love to dental improvements  and murder, this fourth book has it all.<br />Although I think The Goblet of  Fire is an ABSOLUTELY MUST-READ (ha, as if anyone needed my review to know  that), my very most favorite is still Azkaban (Goblet's not too far behind,  though!)<br />Now, when's that fifth book coming out?	2000-07-11

More light is shed on the dark days of Voldemort's  reign of terror, but not enough to stop you from guessing and wondering  what will be revealed in the next book.

If you're just getting involved, read the prior three books first,  otherwise the linkages and neat bits won't have as much impact.<br />Go find a  free weekend and read it.	2000-07-11

Book 4 hardly seems for kids to me, and  I am sure that if there's been any uproar about whether some of the content  is appropriate for kids before this book, it will only become an  increasingly heated debate, as this book takes far darker turns than any of  the other previous books.  But this is part of what makes the book special.  There is some pretty dark imagery and descriptions of conflict that makes  me question whether or not the book is appropriate for children, but then I  remember back to when I was younger, reading some of the violence of C.S.  Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, and I know that it is safe.  When novelists  aren't afraid to write freely, then better books are written.  I believe  this, because I believe that the Harry Potter series successfully uses  conflict, the threat of conflict, and actual violence to create the  suspense of the series.<br />Harry Potter 4 is the equivalent of 'The Empire  Strikes Back'.  It is the best book yet, and it leaves me sad that I have  raced through it, leaving me to wait possibly a year or more for the next  installment in the series.  If any of you parents have reservations, please  don't!  Kids are smart, and this series will challenge them in ways that  others don't.  Hooray for Harry!	2000-07-11

I was glued to the pages and read the night through. I couldn't help laughing out loud sometimes, feeling wonderful for again meeting characters so unbelievably  funny in this book. The writing is daring, this book is somewhat grown up  compared to the the predecessors, like a creature of Hagrid's. Wonderful  and funny yet dangerous and dark. It's very dark indeed in several aspects,  though not cruel (as many and me along them feared). The Universe, that  Joanne K. Rowling created has reached a size that equals it in my opinion  to J.R.R Tolkien's Middle Earth. It has the quality of a spell, entrancing  the reader and being convincing in every aspect. While there are people in  this book who are victimized by dark forces there is always hope! Hope of  the individual power of decision and of the help of true friends. And the  fun of another year at Hogwarts, somewhat dubious in places, but nothing, a  good wizard or witch couldn't handle! This is a great book!	2000-07-11

It is still very well written and very exciting. This episode of the Harry Potter saga  is much longer than the previous tales (743 pages), so we get experience a  much more detailed idea of what it is like to live as a wizard or a witch.  Harry even spends the first several chapters at the Quidditch World Cup  with the Weasleys, so not all of the book (or the plot) revolves around  life at Hogwarts. <br />The characters are growing up, and as such are getting  much more mature. While the development of the characters leads us into the  typical realm of adolescence (ie: boys &amp; girls, dances, etc.), it also  marks a point where we realise our fictional friends are stronger, so  expect a more powerful battle between the forces of good and the forces of  evil. Expect &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; to be much darker then your  previous journeys into Harry's world. Don't expect to find only magic  flavored jellybeans and practical jokes, also expect fear, mutilation, and  death. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; has a much more realistic and heart felt  ending than what you will be expecting, just keep in mind that this is all  pivital to the overall plot of the seven book series. <br />In case I have you  completely down about the dark side of the new book, I might as well  mention that we do get to see Sirius and the loveable little Dobby, as well  as some of Dobby's new elf friends.	2000-07-11

I spent the week prior to July 8 waiting with bated breath for the new book to arrive, and when it did, I devoured it in one sitting.  I had feared that the  anticipation would have built unreasonable expectations for the book but if  anything, it exceeded expectations.<br />Again, the characterizations were  excellent, and we learn more about the central characters (Harry, Ron, Fred  and George especially), but the development of the side characters (Neville  and Snape) gave us new insight to the back story that has been building  since Sorcerer's Stone.  As was expected, Harry is growing up and discovers  girls.  The book itself takes a somewhat more \\"grown up\\" tone when compared  to the previous books.  The first chapter sets the mood for a darker,  possibly more dangerous, more \\"grown up\\" Harry Potter, but this should not  dissuade parents from letting their child read the books. I would encourage  parents to read the books and discuss them with their children.  The parts  younger children may find frightening, such as death or possibility of  death, are things that are part of life.<br />Overall the book rates as a  good addition to a great series.  A must have for Harry Potter fans, and a  reason for those few who haven't picked up the series to start book one.	2000-07-11

Yet I, like millions of others, was caught up in the vivid world which J.K. Rowling creates. The first three books of the series are  all good, light-hearted fun, enchanting to all ages. This book takes a new  turn, displaying the versatility with which J.K. Rowling writes. From the  first pages, you can tell that Harry is older, bringing all the evolution  of character and world-view that comes with it. When we are younger, we  blind ourselves to some of the ugliness in the world. Yet that very  ugliness adds depth to and highlights the beauty and goodness in life. In  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, we see the evidence of this in the  characters and the storyline. It is darker, yes, but in the sense that it  is more realistic in portraying He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named as the true  incarnation of evil he is. It adds new depths and ranges to an already  thrilling story, without overwhelming the inherent humor and light. This  book is the most complex yet, leaving us with a lot to muse over during the  long wait for book five.	2000-07-11

I roared through it for most of Saturday. This is not a young child's book. The darkness that people noticed in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is even more pronounced in &quot;Goblet of  Fire.&quot; In tone, this series reminds me a lot of Susan Cooper's  &quot;Dark is Rising&quot; books but  with a good deal of levening humor. I  was actually surprised at how well &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; hung together  since it logically divides into two major  parts - the World Quidditch Cup  and the fourth year at Hogwarts. I am also amazed and impressed at how  consistent the main characters (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) remain, while  continuing to grow into adulthood (wizardhood?). There are some great  new  characters too(I really liked Krum and Moody) as well as all the old  favorites. In fact, one of the few complaints I have is juggling all of the  new characters' stories  made the middle of the book a little diffuse. I  could have done without the Bagman subplot, although I expect it sets up  something for later. On the other hand, Neville's parents' story really  floored me. Poor kid. And Harry's ordeal at the end of the book is  incredibly intense. Which brings me to my final complaint. DO YOU MEAN I  HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR  TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?	2000-07-10

But J. K. Rowlings  creation, is for the child, the child trapped in the adult and the adult.  This book has made more than one transition, not only it is pivitol to the  story line.  But it has created a new standard in child fiction that  writers will find hard to copy.

I think that the beginning was a little slow- too many chapters before Harry got to Hogwarts.  Once Harry was back in school the  book picked up a bit and got back the flavor of the previous books.  I  noticed that the 4th book was a little more oriented toward older readers-  more &quot;damns&quot; and constant references to boy- girl flirtations.  I  dont know if this is just becuase Harry is getting older or because J.K.  Rowling is letting her books be influenced by popular culture.  This  installment was very much an &quot;in&quot; book, meaning that if you  did'nt read the first 3 you would be kind of lost reading this one.  Certain things in the book were very cute, like when Hermione was  pronouncing her name to Viktor, the Bulgarian quiditch player, obviously  this is a question that the author is constantly asked (especially by us  Americans) and she wanted to clear it up in a cute kind of way.  I thought  some of the hints that the author gave about what was going to happen and  some of the &quot;leaks&quot; were kind of misleading.  A character did die  but not one of the central characters that we really care about.  The  ending of the book was great, though, it really showed Harry's courage and  it showed the power Dumbeldore has.  The ending really set up the last 3  books nicely and I'm sure they'll be very exciting to read now that the  wizarding world is no longer a safe place to be.	2000-07-10

I enjoyed the book, as I have the others, and I am sure that I will not be satisfied when Harry graduates Hogwarts.  I want to see him get married, have a carreer, etc.  The more serious themes also make me want to read more from Rowling beyond Harry Potter.  Even with all of the hype, another great addition to the series.	2000-07-10

Like its three predecessors, it's a book  that you just can't put down.  Although it is the longest Potter book yet  at 752 pages, each page is packed with interesting and imaginative  dialogue, characters, and situations.  In Harry Potter and the Goblet of  Fire, Harry and his fellow fourth-years become more interested in romances  that sometimes cause conflict.  Harry's still wary of You-Know-Who, trying  to be on guard at all times.  These worries are compounded when his scar  begins to throb again and someone makes the \\"Dark Mark\\" with Harry's  wand-the sign of Voldemort!  But once Harry gets back to Hogwarts, there's  too many other things for Harry to concentrate on-the usual class load,  Professor Snape's constant watch, and of course, his crush on a certain  female Quidditch player...Then, there's the huge wizarding event that will  take place at Hogwarts for the first time in years!  Harry tries to stay  out of the limelight, but is soon unwillingly and mysteriously thrown into  the spotlight-and into perilous danger.  And then, of course, are the  hilarious antics of the Weasley twins, the adventures of Harry and his two  best friends, Ron and Hermione, Neville Longbottom's klutzy catastrophes,  the taunting from Harry's nemesis, Draco Malfoy, and the other reasons why  J.K. Rowling's books are so successful.  However, unlike the previous  books, some parts of ...Goblet of Fire concentrate on some scary aspects of  the Dark Arts, something that parents of small children should take in  consideration.  And as the author revealed before the release of the book,  someone does die.  Nevertheless, the new characters that appear in Book 4  are just as crazy and unique as all of the others.  Some of the new  characters come into play as Harry's view of the wizarding world expands  and he and his friends meet wizards from other countries.

The  book is long, 730+ pages, and the plot and characters are well defined and  embellished, and the list of magical creatures and spellbinding action  grows on.<br />This is the richest of the books so far, as Harry is tested  almost beyond his capacity.

I could not put it down, starting it yesterday afternoon and staying up late into the night to finish it. That said, The Goblet of Fire is NOT the same light-hearted, playful and relatively short  story of the first three in the series. From its opening scene, which is  not of Harry at the Dursley's house, it departs from the themes of the  earlier books of a childhood escape-fantasy. While it veers back to the  familiar: Harry with the Dursleys, the Weasleys and with his friends Ron  and Hermione, Harry Potter #4 is the first truly dark book of the series.<br />The skeleton plot that directed the first three books is reworked here,  in a longer format. A full understanding of the plot, and the various  characters' involvements depends on previous knowledge from the first three  books, as well as painstaking attention paid to this fourth installment.  (several jokes and side comments also depend on having read book 3,  specifically) Many more characters are introduced, as well as several more  profound issues, such as an anti-slavery movement and European  international relations. Like the plot, these isssues are not resolved, but  left as part of the essentially cliff-hanger ending.<br />The most comforting  part of this book was the return of Sirius Black, who was my favorite  character from the third book. I can't wait to read more of the series, to  see how JK Rowling deals with the new challenges that she has introduced.  In the future installments of the series, I hope that Rowling continues and  expands the growing theme and plot, while reducing the length and plethora  of characters a little bit, in the quest for a more manageable story.	2000-07-10

As she proved with the first three books, J.K. Rowling can write one heck of a story.  What's even more amazing is that she keeps  the action going for over seven hundred pages.  I've been impressed by  these books for a number of reasons.  The storytelling is excellent.  The  books, though intended for youngsters, are universal, and do not talk down  to the reader, whatever age.  The characters are appealing.  And Rowling  has managed to wean kids off the soundbite size books like the Goosebumps  or Babysitting Club series.<br />Rowling has said that she planned the fourth  book to be pivotal, and so it is.  There is an action-packed Quiddich World  Cup (Ireland vs. Bulgaria) and a wizarding contest.  A muckraking  journalist with an acid-green pen keeps turning up.  Dobby, the loopy  house-elf makes a few appearances.  More of Hagrid's background is  uncovered.  Dumbledore has hired a new Defence Against Dark Arts teacher  who really knows his stuff.  We learn about the Department of International  Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic, and meet students from other  wizarding schools, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.  Harry and Ron have to find  dates for the ball.  And the stakes have gone up in this book, evil has  returned to the wizarding world, and Harry must face more dire and  mysterious situations than ever before.  And, yes, there is a death,  handled skillfully.<br />With any luck, the size of this book will give  Rowling time for a well-earned vacation as she works on number five.  However, a movie is in the works, which is a shame, since every reader can  already see Harry, and movies are incomplete, while books contain the whole  story.  More unfortunate, though, is the fact that the merchandising will  come, the toys in the happy meals, the endless advertisements for junk.  The coming marketing has been likened to noise which will overwhelm the  reader quietly enjoying the books themselves.  But here's the rest of the  story:  the movie will pass on to the video rental places and be tucked  into the &quot;family viewing&quot; area and the merchandise will all end  up in the landfill when the next thing comes along; but to readers, the  books will be in our heads, and on our bookshelves and will be shared with  children yet to come.enjoying the books themselves.

I didn't mind the fanciful witches and wizards but this isn't the role model I want for my kids.<br />I think it is too bad Rowling didn't just continue with the formula for success she had going for her.

Rowling's fast-growing series. The expected limit of only seven books for this fantastic series is almost dissapointing, when one stops to reflect that there are now only three new books to be released in  the future. I read &quot;...the Goblet...&quot; in less than 24 hours, and  was enchanted every minute. From the very first chapter, I was hooked: Lord  Voldemort was back.  I was captivated by the idea of a Triwizard Tournament  between Hogwarts School, Durmstrang Institute, and Beauxbatons Academy, and  when Harry's name was mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire as a fourth  contender, I knew that Harry Potter book #4 was clearly the best of the  bunch. The bizarre twists and turns along the chapters had me guessing what  on earth Rowling would think of next. J.K. Rowling continues to  surprise and astound me, and I am positive her next book in the Potter  series will be anything but dissapointing! I can't wait!	2000-07-10

I don't know if you ever get migraine headaches but I've had one all weekend from summer school yet I still couldn't put this book down. The mystery is so enthralling, the adventure  so exciting, and the fantasy so spelllbinding that it makes a very easy yet  enjoyable read.  The reader cannot help but relate to Harry's problems even  though they're a world apart. That's probably what is so unique about the  book: Although it very obviously happens in an alternate reality where  magic happens, the people could easily be real.  Coming of age,  prejudice,  power hungriness, and hate are all the same issues in Harry's world as in  ours.  Anyways, the only thing I was disappointed about was that the ending  was less than emotionally fulfilling.  Yet being the turning point in the  series, I cannot think of anything else that could have made sense.  Hence  5 stars, hence read the book.	2000-07-10

The magic in this book is inspired, delightful, and in some cases  horrifying.  The magic of the entire series is its ability to portray the  challenges of growing up, and of using responsibly the awesome powers of  the adult world.  This book vividly portrays those who have met the  challenge, those who have failed, and the world-altering consequences of  such failure.  Although this book is full of mischievous magic that will  delight children, it also contains curses, hexes and a climactic graveyard  scene that may terrify them.  It touches on death, torture, racism,  genocide, \\"human\\" rights, the nature of power, and evil itself.  These  themes, however,  are balanced by compassion, friendship, loyalty,  morality, family, and love.  The Harry Potter series introduces young  children to the \\"dark\\" world that adults have created, but also shows them  that they have the power to reshape the world to their liking.  Questions  of how to use this ultimate magic are raised throughout this book.   Answers, however, are rare.  That is a task for adults, and for the rest of  the series.	2000-07-10

Harry Potter's newest adventure is just as full of excitement and drama as his last three, if not more so.<br />I first started reading Harry Potter on a dark and stormy night, when I was alone in the house.  The book was my little sister's, and, as I was bored out of my mind, I picked it up and  began to read.<br />I am an avid and enthusiastic reader and I finished the  309-page book the next day.  I was utterly enthralled by the wonderfully  three-dimensional characters, fantastic plot, and most of all by the  stunning language use.  I am really a name person, and when I saw names  like Albus Dumbledore, Sirius Black, and Hermione Granger, I was hooked.  I  have followed Harry's edge-of-your-seat adventures from the time he was  eleven to the present, and each book (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's  Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry Potter and the  Prisoner of Azkaban) proved more exciting than the last.<br />Author J. K.  Rowling's newest book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, is no  exception.  Like it's predecessors, the plot slowly winds itself into a  hopeless knot of mystery--the reader is totally baffled as to the solution.  Then, with something akin to Sherlock Holmes, everything falls into place,  resulting in a dazzling climax.  This 752-page book sets the stage for a  future climax more dramatic than anything we've seen before.<br />The story  begins as the old caretaker of &quot;The Riddle House&quot; witnesses a  strange scene: someone called Wormtail is having a conversation with an  anonymous hissing voice.  They are plotting death.  Thousands of miles  away, Harry Potter awakes, the small, lightning-shaped scar on his forehead  burning like fire.<br />There are more strange occurrences--rioting and fear  at the Quidditch World Cup, unexplainable disappearances and deaths.  The  dread Lord Voldemort is becoming stronger, building his power for a fresh  attack on wizard-kind, and there is only one person to stop him.<br />Harry  Potter, minding his own business at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry, is suddenly, mysteriously entered in the Triwizard Tournament, a  competition between the three greatest wizards in the three greatest  European Wizarding schools: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.  Exposed  to terrible danger, he competes in three seemingly impossible tasks, but  nothing can prepare him for his confrontation with his lifelong  enemy.<br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was thoroughly un-putdown-able  and thoroughly wonderful.  I especially enjoyed the little tidbits dropped  enticingly throughout the story--tidbits about the characters' pasts.  There are also still some unsolved mysteries--but of course the biggest one  of all is: Will Harry Potter manage to defeat the Dark Lord?Harry  Potter, minding his own business at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry, is suddenly, mysteriously entered in the Triwizard Tournament, a  competition between the three greatest wizards in the three greatest  European Wizarding schools: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.

I was  totally spellbound through the whole book as I was made to feel a whole  range of emotions from excitement and happiness to being scared and angered  for all the things that can happen to a famous wizard who knows so little  about the wizarding world.

I &quot;pre-read&quot; it so that I could decide whether or not  my son should read it (although I would have wanted to read it anyway after  thoroughly enjoying the first three!).  It is clear that Ms. Rowling has  carefully planned all of Harry's seven years of Hogwarts adventures, and  this novel seems to be a pivotal point in the continuing story of the  series, requiring the addition of some dangerous plot elements.  Although  as an adult reader I look forward to seeing resolutions of these dangers in  later books, young children may find this book more frightening than the  first three.  The intricately detailed wizarding world continues to  delight, through vivid descriptions, more mature development of  relationships, and nonstop action.

It is  not for the weak hearted.  The themes of bravery and friendship run through  this installment just as in the earlier books. (I could have done without  Hermione's p.c. campaign against house-elf &quot;slave labor&quot;  though!)<br />Although this was not my favorite of the four books, it was a  great read, and I would highly recommend it to any Harry Potter fan.

Amid the media hoopla surrounding this fourth installment of _Harry Potter_, it's easy to get a bit skeptical about Ms. Rowling's purported powers of penmanship.  But, all 700-and-some-odd pages live up to the hype  and anticipation - this is a GOOD BOOK!  It's lovely to revisit all the  old Hogwarts' traditions and characters that have grown in the first three  books.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are unmistakably older and experience new  and intriguing problems in their social lives, but their personalities (and  sense of humor) remain unaltered. In addition, we are introduced to some  new and wonderfully outrageous characters who happen to also play an  intrinsic part in the storyline, and we get to enjoy some very inventive  magic. But the best thing about this book is definitely the plot.  Every  seemingly random tidbit laid down throughout the book swoops together for a  breathtaking final hundred pages.  It's so satisfying not to have to worry  about loose ends.  I don't want to give anything even remotely specific  away - just enough to make you read the book.  The final battle is very  exciting, very suspenseful, very evil... And, as I'm sure mothers world  over as well as the morning talkshows will appreciate, all kinds of good,  moral values are sprinkled throughout the book - wholesome but not preachy,  thrilling but not terrifying, with a similar structure to the previous  three books but not in the least predictable, and Rowling finally reveals  how to pronounce Hermione's name!	2000-07-10

Well, it took me a while to buy into the Harry Potter craze. I was determined to last out as long as possible, but I finally caved in a month or so ago and ended up reading the first three books in the series in one  weekend.  As a child, I loved the Chronicles of Narnia and the children's  books by Roald Dahl. I found Rowling's Potter series to be no less  enjoyable, although her style is quite different from both Lewis and Dahl.  I felt I might be disappointed with the fourth installment because I've  come to expect so much of the series. Thankfully, I was not. Whether it is  because I know and love the characters now or because this book is even  better than the first three, I loved it! And I could not believe that I had  gotten through over 700 pages of it and still wanted more. Admittedly,  there is a lot of explanation of background material, as with the other  three books, and often what seems obvious is spelled out, but this makes  sense considering that the series is written primarily for children (but  enjoyed by all!). So, regardless of what some critics may say, I think that  the only things Rowling encourages with this series are the love of reading  and the desire to be brave, fair, and kind-hearted. I'd say that if you  haven't bought your copy yet, buy it now. Trust me, you won't regret it.	2000-07-10

I did finish the first 3 in one  week and I finished the goblet of fire in one day (I'm a pretty fast  reader!) and the story is a gripping story, a lot of fun to read. I won't  say too much about the plot because kids and adults alike should read this  story. The readers may notice that Harry and Ron and Hermione are starting  to grow up and change a little bit, developing crushes on the opposite sex,  and have to deal with the issue of death and as expected, a traitor in the  midst of Hogwarts. Of course Ms. Rowling always likes to lead the reader to  believe that one character should be guilty of the heinous crimes that have  terrorized the student body, but the truth does prevail!<br />It's OK, to buy  the book for yourself if you are old enough to drive and vote.

It was so much more different than the other books because it sort of delves into Harry's psyche. He faces the constant pressures of fame especially when Ron, his best friend, thinks Harry is just in the Triwizard Tournament for more fame...I felt Harry's pain when everyone starts getting angry at him. The task's were cool since Harry had to escape a Hungarion Horntail, rescue his friends underwater, and fight his way to the Triwizard Cup.

And with younger ones, this gives them a  peek into the creative twist of words Joanne is capable of weaving into a  serious yet hilarious story.

As I was waiting to pick up my copy at Midnight Friday, it occurred to me that a cruel jokester might walk away from the clerk, pretend to skim through the book and then shout out to the 300 or so Harry fans &quot;My  God!  She killed off Hagrid!&quot; or Ron or Hermione. As callous as it may  seem, I don't think anyone will really care about the person that died.  The victim was well chosen, as the name will certainly be used as a  rallying call, like &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot; over the next several  books, and there will certainly be implications for Harry's love life.  Which brings up the biggest difference about this book, that is the  introduction of sex.  Not explicit sex, but multiple allusions to teenage  passions, past and present.  What with the routine treatment of gambling  and office politics, the Goblet of Fire is by far the most mundanely adult  of the series. To wrap up - the book starts out as less of a stand-alone  than the others and feels off until the scene shifts back to Hogwarts.  The  last 150 pages or so are outstanding and merit prompt re-reading.	2000-07-10

JK Rowling, (that Publishing Industry euphemism for Gold), has outdone herself again, just when we thought it was impossible. This book is a worthy bearer of the Harry Potter name, and tells all of us that when we ordered it in advance, we were trusting our instincts perfectly. More than  that, it tells us that we were right in doing so- which is probably the  most wonderful feeling in the world!<br />It all starts when Mrs Weasley  decides to call Harry for the Quidditch World Cup, held this time in  Britain. Harry is off and running before you can say &quot;Catch That  Snitch&quot;. What follows is a Quidditch banquet that will delight any  connosieur. There are a lot of international teams this time, and this  almost turns into a carnival.  However, this is dampened slightly when one  finds that there will be no inter-house Quidditch matches. But, wait.  Before you groan, there's some good news- Inter School matches!  As anyone  who's read Enid Blyton knows, these are THE big moments of any school year,  and these show a rare display of Hogwarts spirit against two rival  wizarding schools who've come from other places.<br />There are, of course  lots of other good parts here. I particularly loved ther new  Defence-Against-The - Dark Arts- teacher, and Harry's sudden and much  awaited interest in girls. It was a slight let down in parts, but I must  admit that there are interesting moments when Harry tries to figure out  what the upwardly mobile young wizard must do to get that cute little witch  to accompany him to the Yule Ball. I'm not going to be a total spoilsport  and tell you her name- you'll have to read it for yourself, of course- but  trust me, it'll remind you of the first time you fell in love!<br />So, just  what is wrong with this book? Somehow, there was something that just didn;t  gel. The plot is tight- Alistair MacLean would have killed to have a plot  this nerve-wracking- , the writing style is rich, sweeping and wonderfully  textured, and Rowling's imagination has only got better- if that could have  been thought possible!  But, somehow, the book seems a little disorienting.<br />It's difficult to put my finger on it, but the most obvious reason is  that this is, above all, a very DARK,very sinister, very ADULT book.  Adult. There, I';ve said it. The first three Harry Potters worked  beautifully because they were written for children. Us grown-ups- when we  read them- were taken back to that wild, exhilirating ride that we called  childhood. The previous books provided a gateway for us to just get out of  this world- with all it's ups and downs, especially downs-  and to go back  to an Enid-Blytonesque innocence. This book, on the other hand,has a  darker, more gloomy tinge, almost approaching that other epic, The Lord of  the Rings.<br />I'm not saying that Rowling has sold out and gone and written  a book for adults instead of children. It's just that this book seems to  have been written after the Harry-Potter-is-good-for-adults-too phase, when  a lot of adults unabashedly declared themselves Potterphiles. Children too  can relate to this book superbly, but bringing in topics like Death( well,  you knew there'd be one- just whose, you'll have to wait and see...) and  Teen Mushiness sort of spoilt what was an otherwise excellent series for  me.  Call me old fashioned, call me a purist, but I somehow wasn't too  comfortable with the idea of these ADULT themes getting into a Harry Potter  book. It isn;t as if the story is bad- I'm already waiting for Book 5- but  there's a small part of me that wishes that Rowling had continued to write  her &quot;only for kids aged 8-12&quot;  Boarding School masterpieces....ng's imagination has only got better- if that could have  been thought possible!

But it did.  Book Four contains many favorite characters (Harry, Dumbledore, Hermione, the  Weasly's, Sirius, etc.) and not-so-favorites (Voldemort, the Malfoy's,  Snape, etc.) while introducing many new ones.  While the first 3 or 4 pages  are just setting the scene, the rest of the book builds in tensions and  suspense until it reaches its climax as the end of the Hogwarts draws near.  The end is marked by tragedy for Hogwarts (especially Hufflepuff), but is  also deliciously scary and full of magic.  I began reading as soon as the  book arrived on our doorstep, and I couldn't put it down!  The 700+ pages  may seem intimidating at first, but once you get started, it doesn't seem  nearly that wrong, because everything ties together, both in the book and  between books.

Just like the first three books, the story draws you inand is very suspenseful.  New characters are great and the familiar characters grow and develop more and more.  The world of Harry Potter seems to become darker and wider and scarier while still keeping its sense of humor and magic.  But in the first three books, the evil of Voldemorte was only hinted at, and now you begin to see just how terrible it was and might become again.  It leaves you wishing you had the next book already- even though the next one is probably going to be sad and darker still.

This book lives up to all of our expectations of the Fourth Harry Potter book. This book starts off when Harry getsout of Privet Drive and joins his  friend Ron and Ron's family in the Burrow. Then Harry, the Weasley's, (even  Bill and charlie,)and Harry's other freind Hermione are off to the  Quidditch World Cup. After a spectacular game, (including dancing Veela  from Bulgaria and leprechans from Ireland) a crowd of dark wizards  terrifies everyone at the world cup and then the Dark Mark is conjured up,  ( You-Know-Who's sign)supposedly by Harry's wand.  After this strange  ending to the quidditch cup, the crowd of wizards returns to Hogwarts, only  to find out that there will be no quidditch at Hogwarts this year. The  reason for this is that Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard tournament,  in which Hogwarts will be competing with two other wizarding schools,  Beauxbatons and Durmstrong. Even, though wizards only above 17 can enter,  someone (possibly Lord Voldemort) has entered Harry into the mysterious  Goblet of Fire, and the Goblet has picked him. Harry is bound by a magical  contract to the tournament and to three deadly tasks. Will he survive?  While Harry is dreaming of Cho, and avoiding Snape, he also has something  else worrying him .... the Triwizard Tournament!	2000-07-10

It immediately grabs you into the book with a powerful first chapter. Death  is immediate as Ms. Rowling promised. But there is a change, all you  Quidditch fans you won't read too much about it because the interhouse  tournament is called off this fourth year for Harry Potter and the  TriWizard tournament is put in its place. I'm not gonna spoil the ending  but you can probably guess that Harry Potter is gonna have something to do  with it along with Ron and Hermione.

The development of the long-term  characters, including deeper exploration of the dynamics between Harry, Ron  and Hermione, was fabulous.  The dual approach to the threat of Lord  Voldemort - his current activities, and the historical revelations dating  to Harry's infancy - were well entwined.  But the hero himself, Harry  Potter, age 14, remains the piece de resistance of the series.  He  continues to be an affable, frustrated, complex and complicated teenager -  in short, a normal one, for all his possession of Invisibility Cloaks and  Magic Wands.  J.K.

(But watch the age group reading)	Harry Potter IV lived up to every expectation that I had! I would however, comment that I am an adult reader and have the maturity to handle many of the darker things that occur in this book. Young readers that love Harry at  11 may need a bit more help understanding Harry at 14. The curses are  darker, the plot is a bit more complex, and J.K. Rowling leaves no doubt  why we should hate the villian. If your kids are easily spooked, the darker  tone of this book may throw them off a little bit.  BUT, as a lover of  literature, the work is well written, beautifully pieced together, and as  funny as always. Rowling seamlessly tells Harry's next adventure... and  sets the stage for the next three books. Remember, Harry is getting older  as each new book is published. While he was 11 in Book 1, he will be 17 in  book 7. I LOVE HARRY POTTER, but I think that there are some readers hooked  at 12, that might not be ready to take on some of the ideas held in the  book.

My nephew (who got it on Saturday for his birthday) was so excited that it was coming that  he climbed into the FedEx truck to get his package when it arrived. Thank  goodness it was worth both the wait and the hype.<br />This was a darker book  than the previous three, as well as a much longer one, but it was also  exciting and worth a few hours time that it takes to read it. I didn't  realize until this book how good Rowling is at capturing the tone of normal  people. Her wizards and witches don't just cope with magical dilemmas and  joys, they cope with human ones as well: Harry discovers girls, Hermione  discovers boys, everybody gets to see the finals for the Quidditch World  Cup (sports are eternal), Ron gets tired of being the eternal sidekick, and  still they all have to cope with classes (the new Defense Against the Dark  Arts teacher is a doozy) and the latest creatures that Hagrid's accquired.<br />I will say that I was disappointed in the heavy-handed racial  understanding subplot, but since it eventually tied back to the main plot,  I'll forgive Rowling this.

We all waited with bated breath for the tale of Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts....the biggest question was not whether or not Harry would fall in love, or whether Hagrid would make it through another year as a professor.  The biggest question was whether or not J.K. Rowling would be able to  sustain the excitement, the fascination, the following that was generated  by books 1, 2, and 3.  I am thrilled to say that she has. Rowling has to be  magical herself to be able to continue at this level.<br />Without giving  away any of the plot I can confirm: Yes, someone does die, and no, Harry  doesn't fall in love. Snape still hates Harry, and stoops terribly low to  show his hatred. Ron's family is still poor, Hermione is still living in  the library. Malfoy is still proving that Malfoy and malevolent come from  the same Latin root.<br />To say anything more would be to ruin it for anyone  that hasn't read it yet.

Harry continues his adventures at Hogwarts, excelling not at Quidditch this time, but in the dangerous and exciting Triwizard tournament against students from other wizarding schools. However, a devious reporter and an agent of Voldemort's, along with other captivating characters, are doing their best to help Harry win- or to help him die. I highly recommend this book, along with the three previous Harry books. A word of caution, however- this book is slightly darker than the earlier books- it has more violence, including some against Muggles, and someone actually dies. Younger children could possibly be scared. Besides that, it's a great book. Bring on the next three!	2000-07-10

The heft of a 750 page volume may seem intimidating (can  a child even lift this thing?) yet the author makes use of the expanded  length to ratchet the emotional intensity of the series to a new level,  particularly in the later part of the book.<br />As always, the characters  and descriptions in the book are rich and engaging, and her imagination is  so wonderfully developed that the world she writes about is as much alive  as our own or that of any of the great fantasy writers.  Even more  rewarding, the author provides a complex and nuanced study of such critical  issues as prejudice, inequality, freedom, honor, responsibility, and the  costs of making moral choices.<br />Both the major and minor characters in the  novel are not only entertaining but keep the reader guessing as to their  true nature and intentions.  This combined with the very nature of  Rowlings' magical world offer both children and adults with the perfect  opportunity to re-examine our assumptions about what we see, what we know,  and what we understand.<br />I only hope we don't have long to wait before  being able to enjoy Harry's next year at Hogwarts.	2000-07-10

The flap of the dust-jacket of the fourth installment of Harry Potter calls the book &quot;pivotal&quot; -- and it is.  Harry Potter's latest adventure finds our hero growing up.  He's discovering girls, having nasty  arguments with friends, learning of the greater wizarding world and  becoming quite powerful as well.  But just as Harry is coming of age, so is  the material.  The previous three books have treated the presence of  Voldemort as a foil, rather than a deadly enemy.  Harry has had many close  calls in the past, but the violence has always been offstage and often  vague or vaguely comical.  But in this book, Harry faces the consequences  of evil action directly. Never has the devastation caused by evil been so  powerfully described, in this series or any other book.  It is the  horrendous consequences (lost families and friends and the emotional toll  of such loss) that are the important descriptions, not the circumstance.  When people lose parents or friends, it takes one sentence to describe the  death but pages to describe the emotional and psychological damage.  Based  on responses to the previous books, I imagine that there will be a great  deal of anger and outrage expressed about the content of this book.  Yet it  is the unflinching examination of good and evil that gives this book, and  the series itself, the power to capture the imagination.  Although terrible  events occur, the author extols the virtues of bravery, integrity, honesty  and compassion in the face of such horror.  The events themselves are  narrated without artifice nor are they filtered through a morally ambiguous  viewpoint.  It is by directly and honestly contrasting the qualities of  heroism and villainy that Ms. Rowling has managed to reinforce the  importance and necessity of such qualities.  More so than any other book,  this book examines the nature of right and wrong and human frailty, and  demands that good people actively choose to perform good deeds.  I cannot  imagine that there is a better lesson to be learned, or a better series to  teach that lesson.that there is a better lesson to be learned, or a better series to  teach that lesson.	2000-07-10

Though my favorite will probably always be &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, J. K. Rowling's  ever-imaginative characters and and supernatural events keep the pages  turning no less in number four than with the first. There are the usual  scuffles between Potter and friends and their rivals at Hogwarts as they  experience new and exciting adventures in their fourth year of school.  There are creepy new characters, both good and dark, whose motives one  never can quite figure out until the end.  And of course, there is the  climactic struggle between good and evil, present in all of the Potter  books, in which Harry must fight for his life and for the continuing  suppression of Lord Voldemort, his arch-nemesis. So, thrill to the speed  and excitement of the Quidditch World Cup, cheer for Harry as he triumphs  again and again in dangerous adventures, and laugh at Rowling's hilariously  detailed look at life at Hogwarts -- but most of all, enjoy the experience  the fourth Harry Potter book in the series. It's sure to be a hit!	2000-07-10

Is this what adolescence is all about? If so, I'm just glad my own is so far in the past that I don't remember it clearly; someone must have  mercifully slipped me a memory charm. The book opens with violent death in  a Muggles house before the reader gets a chance to catch up with Harry at  the Dursleys where one is astounded to learn that Dudley has finally been  put on a diet. Harry is invited to stay with the Weasleys and attend the  World Quidditch Match but the play-by-play by a former professional player  is nothing like so fine as that of Lee Jordan's calling of the school games  and professional players can use dirtier tricks than even the Slytherin  team.<br />The plot of this volume revolves around the Triwizard Tournament: a  magic competition involving participants from three major wizardry schools:  Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. As usual Harry must use a combination  of bravery, intelligence and reliance on his friends to solve the various  puzzles set for him. In this book, however, he also has to deal with more  serious issues: a school dance, jealous friends, a nosy reporter and  recurring frightening visions. I don't think that its giving anything away  to say that he wins through in the end, though the fourth Harry Potter is  not as light-hearted as the earlier books and the reader is left hanging at  the conclusion, wondering what is going to happen next.<br />Ms. Rowling's  usually subtle message is a little more deliberately spelled out in this  book than in some of her former books. When confronted with the Imperius  Curse (which acts like powerful hypnosis), Harry resists the instructions  he is given through his own strength of will and ability to think for  himself. For me, this has always been the most attractive message in the  Harry Potter books: the individual should question what he is told and  decide for himself if something is the right thing to do. It's good to see  that Harry doesn't forget this crucial knowledge, even when faced with  being fourteen. While this volume was not, actually, as much fun to read as  the earlier books, it still deserves &quot;unputdownable&quot; status.s good to see  that Harry doesn't forget this crucial knowledge, even when faced with  being fourteen.

However, we are  quickly submerged in the wonderful lives of the lovable Weasley family and  entralled with the latest inventions of Fred and George.  Harry comes face  to face with Charlie and the very COOL Bill Weasley and the suspense begins  at the Quiddich World Cup!  We even see Harry and Ron's friendship tested  and we are left with a very positive feeling that Ron has serious feelings  regarding Hermione!

We also  learn that Lucius Malfoy is exactly as we have always believed him to be!  Harry is in contact with his Godfather, Sirius Black, and we find out why  Harry must endure the Dursleys every summer rather than spending them with  those that love him.  We also find out why Lord Voldemort's curse did not  work on Harry!  There is one great sadness, a character, does in fact  die!

My two daughters, my wife and I took turns reading a  few chapters at a time so no one felt cheated.  The first chapter just  reaches out and grabs you.  At one point it seems that Harry Potter is  going to play a non-central role because of the triwizard tournament but he  immediately gets thrust into the limelight due to an unexpected turn of  events.  Snape and others are up to there usual nasty selves though the  new Defender of the Dark Arts teacher help balance out their unjust  behavior along the way.  Also, Voldermolt is back and you get treated to  more history of Harry Potters encounter at age one.  Enjoy!  One note: I  highly recommend you read the 3 previous volumes first to fully understand  and appreciate this 4th (and best) literary installment.	2000-07-10

Were there really over 700 pages?  &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; firebolted by until the last 100 pages...when I kept needing to pause because my teeth were grinding or chattering, eyes burning with tears of disbelief, and I couldn't stop yelling advice to Harry and gaping in  amazement and horror as Rowling slowly, exquisitely unveiled layer after  layer (after layer!) of plot surprises.  Rowling has such a gift for making  you feel like you're a part of the action, a friend of Harry's--which I  guess is why I miss him &amp; Hogwarts so much between book releases.  &quot;The Goblet&quot; is a great, suspenseful read--the most gripping of  the series to date--and filled with all the intricate details that made the  others so magical.

Having bought the 4th book of the Harry Potter series on Saturday morning, July 8, my 9-year-old boy and I vied for the reading of it.  While we shared reading aloud some chapters, and traded it off, I got to read it  after he fell asleep and finished it at 3:45 in the morning.<br />The Goblet  of Fire is a combination of the intensity and themes of Books 1 and 3, I  thought, with a goodly amount of Voldemort, Azkaban, and the Ministry of  Magic, as well as a peek into the wider wizardry world of Rowling's than  just the UK (though all from Euro-Asia).  Themes of Harry's friendship with  Hermione, Ron, and the rest of the Weasleys were developed, as well as the  early teenage stirrings of the Fourth Year class (girls more so than the  boys, naturally).  And Harry's heroism, daring, and good character are  continually confirmed.<br />There are some Mission Impossible-like plot twists  near the end, but it all hangs together very well.  It was interesting,  too, to compare the actual plot elements with the many rumors -- the main  characters falling in love with other people, the death of a main  character, etc, etc.  Although attractions to the opposite sex were there,  Rowling sensibly kept those subplots on the back burner for these mostly  14-year-old characters.  I won't spoil the surprise of who dies, for there  are some close calls in the book, and the darker feel of this book is  apparent from the first chapter, where a man dies.<br />In toto, if you  liked the first three, you HAVE to read the fourth.  It does not  dissappoint!	2000-07-10

This has been worth waiting for, you will find that it gets  more and more interesting as the chapters unfold. Harry is definetly  maturing and the themes are a bit more grown up. Which is to be expected of  a fourth year student. Relations deepen and also touch on themes mentioned  in book three. I will not say anything about the many adventures Harry and  his friends find themselves in, except to say there are certainly twists  and turns that are not expected. This is as much an adventure story as a  mystery book. It is more graphic and I will have Max write his view point  when he finishes his book. Now I have to wait another year until book 5.

It seems to me that Rowling is constantly heating up the battle between good and evil, and book four really gets the fire going.  Though it was darker, heavier, and more intense, I thought it fit really  well into the series.  And while Rowling denies trying to teach any moral  lessons to children, I don't think Dumbledore can resist.  Whether or not  Rowling intends it,you can't read this book without feeling like you have  learned something.  Some of the heavier issues Rowling tackles in this book  show that Harry has real strength of character.  He is brave, selfless,  fair, honorable, and is willing to do what is right, rather than what is  merely easy.  So, while Rowling may not necessarily be trying to  &quot;teach&quot; these lessons, I think Harry Potter is an excellent role  model for my children.	2000-07-10

Happily, I was  not disappointed.<br />I don't want to spoil the story for anybody, so I'll  just say a few words for any parents who are concerned about the  suitability of the new book for their young children.  First, while the  book is, indeed, scary, I would not say that it is substantially more  frightening than &quot;Chamber of Secrets.&quot;  Second, a character does  die, yes, but Rowling handles the death in quite a tasteful manner that  should cause no nightmares.  Third, there is a tiny sprinkling of profanity  in the book which was not present in the previous books.  The oaths were  mild, though, and can be glossed over by those parents sensitive to such  things.<br />Three more books are coming, and Rowling has set things in motion  for a great climax in the future books.

In spite of the length, it was still a quick read.  I definitely enjoyed it, but it was much darker in tone than the previous three.  I also missed the regular  Quidditch games, as they were quite entertaining and a fun break from the  intrigue. The Triwizard Cup was interesting, but not quite as fun as  Quidditch, since it was fairly clear who was going to win the  Challenge.<br />There were a lot more characters in this book, and not all of  them were well developed.  Too many ministers and &quot;outsiders&quot;  (Maxime, Karkoroff) who we never really got to know.  I also kind of missed  the Dursleys, who only really appear in cameo, at the start.  She does a  great job with the usual gang, and it was nice to meet the older Weasley  boys.  Hopefully they will appear again, as they seem to have great  promise, and are much more interesting than Percy.<br />The evil in this book  seems more real, and less fantasy, than the previous books, and the kids  are definitely growing up.  Hormones kick in!

The book was a fine installment of the Potter series, but I found that it was nowhere near the consistently high level of the first three.  Although I am pleased to say that I hated Draco Malfoy and Uncle Vernon as much as  ever, they have remained the same characters with the same functions and  quirks as in other Potter books.  One might expect even the lowly Draco to  develop somewhat over the 1600 pages that thus far constitute the series.  The author does remarkably, however, in the development of the young  protagonists in the story - tackling now more of the adolescent angst and  trials faced by normal, non-wizarding teens.  Every now and then I paused  from my reading to gather my thoughts and recall that this is no longer an  11-year-old Harry!<br />After the first two-thirds of the volume I was a  little wary of finishing it, at least with the zeal and anticipation with  which I had greeted the beginning.  However, last 200 pages of the book are  Potter story telling at its best, but this quality was somehow both  enhanced and disturbed by the slow exposition and development.<br />Despite  this, I do love Ms. Rawlings' ability to keep me teased and surprised by  the eventual outcome of all of her stories.  She has the ability to drop a  bomb on the reader with frighteningly few pages left in the book, yet still  quickly and efficiently defend and even render completely sensible this  move.<br />I will read this again...

This is not children's literature on the level of &quot;Alice in  Wonderland,&quot; but then, what modern child could possibly read and  understand this now-classic today?  The nice thing about Harry Potter books  is that they are full of excellent and amusing details: the quirks of the  professors at Hogwarts, the array of sweets that explode or surprise, the  range of good and evil in the characters...all of whom are better defined  than Harry himself.  The fight between good and evil (evil may come close,  but we are comforted in knowing that good will eventually prevail) is  exciting and helps to move the action along in between discursive bits on  classwork in Potions or the History of Magic, but the books, this one  especially, lack a hero.  Harry Potter is more a collection of facts (scar,  parents' deaths, awful family, green eyes, etc) than a real person who, put  to the test and tried, triumphs for reasons of character.  Harry isn't a  hero, he isn't even as interesting as most of the other young wizards he  knows, and certainly not as interesting as the grown-ups.  &quot;The Goblet  of Fire&quot; has a REAL hero, however: Cedric Diggory.  He seems to embody  all the admirable traits that Harry is credited with.  I look forward to  the next installment of this series, and I also look forward to the  characters' growth as they grow older and as the plot thickens (as it  certainly has) and they rise to meet the challenges of good and evil,  everyday and extra-ordinary.	2000-07-10

The only thing about the storyline I will reveal that Harry  will be chosen for competing in the Triwizard Tournament, the tournament  set between several wizards and witches from around the world to see who is  the best.  Harry competes in it even though he did not enter his name.  This leads to questioning on how he was entered.  The tournament can be  dangerous so could someone be trying to kill Harry Potter.  If you want to  find out read the book. If you have not ever read any of the Harry Potter  books I recommend reading them starting with Harry Potter and the  Sorcerer's Stone.	2000-07-10

This is definetley an achievement for anyone under the age of 12 to read.  It's twice the size of the other books.  Heres some clues to what happens: Harry is submitted into the Triwizard contest, where three wizards from  different schools compete against each other.  He was submitted under the  age limit by someone unknown.  Because he was listed under a different  school, he was picked as a champion.  This makes two Hogwarts champions.   The other is the Hufflepuff seeker, Cedric Diggory.  The new  defense-against-the-dark-arts teacher is Mad Eye Moody, an auror for the  Ministry of magic. I won't tell you who gets killed-that would ruin the  whole book.  But I will tell you this- it's a student and he wasn't a main  character. Harry dosen't really get a girlfriend though he does have a huge  crush on Cho Chang, the ravenclaw seeker.  There's also no quidditch played  in this book, so we don't find out who the new captain is until the next  book.  Sirius is back, and so is Pettigrew (Wormtail).  Percy's back, now  working for the Ministry, and you finally get to meet Bill and Charlie, the  oldest Weasley brothers.  Harry also gets to go to see the World Quidditch  Cup with the Weasley family.  Read this book If you loved the others.  It's  great.  Voldemort also rises again and I for one can't wait to find out  what happens in the next 3 books.  That will be awhile though.	2000-07-10

I will not reveal too much about the book, because it is too good to spoil it for everyone. It starts out differently than the other books, begining in the village in  which the evil wizard, Lord Voldemort's father grew lived in. Voldemort is  having a conference with his despicable servant, Wormtail (A.K.A. Peter  Pettigrew) The muggle gardener of the house mysteriously vanishes on the  same night they were having this meeting.  Meanwhile, a few hundred miles  away, Harry Potter scar begins to hurt, which is one of the strange events  leading up to a BIG turning point in the series. Harry is invited to the  Quidditch world cup where a terrifying event happens, which seems to  confirm that something is going to happen.  There is no quidditch (dang  it!) except for the beginning, but there is another contest between three  schools. The book goes on about how a mysterious fourth contestant is  picked by an impartial judge, and Harry's up and down year at Hogwarts. The  book finishes off with a twist and a bang, but I will reveal no more.  I literally lovedthis book! It combines action, suspense, friendship,  trouble by the mischevious Fred and George Weasly who we all like so much,  and maybe even a little romance. J.K. Rowling, in my opinion, has outdone  herself this time, and I really wish it won't take so long for the next  book to come out! (The event in this book is SOO big that i cannot wait for  the next one)  If your a fan, this is a must read, and if you haven't  picked up this series yet, DO!	2000-07-10

Saying i at all disliked the book would be a complete lie, (It was one of the best books i have read, and i finished it in 2 days), but there were  some things that dissapointed me.<br />But first, i will explain why I liked  the book so much. Its most prominent feature is how imaginative it is.  There is hardly one thing in the book that is hard to visualize, this would  not be such a prominent feature, except for the amount of made up magical  things in the book, everything is described beautifully. Also, the main  charachters are all quite likeable, and you want to find out what happens  to them, making it a real page turner. And lastly, the adventures they go  on are always unexpected, and the book is very exciting.<br />With all that  said, it seems there would be very little one could find that was negative  about this book, and this is true, but there are still a few things i  disliked, all of them having to do with the charachter development.  Probably because this book was written for young children, no-one in the  book truely seemed freightening, and i thought that the evil charachters  didn't seem quite evil enough. The only other problem with the book, (and  the far greater one in my mind) is that there was a quite unnexpected  change in a charachter at the end of the book, and nothing that happened  through the rest of the book seemed to lead up to it, it was just sort of  thrown at you, which was slightly annoying.<br />These two bad points,  however, barely detract from how wonderfull the book is, and I strongly  urge anyone who dosn't already have a copy to get one!	2000-07-10

Hopefully Rowling will  find some way carrying the plot all the way to the seventh book without  repeating the same story line. Just a minor thing, though.

Has it been worth the wait? Well, yes and no.<br />Yes, because all Harry Porter fans will read this book, no matter its quality.  It's gripping enough and the intrique and Hogwarts atmospherics are still  sufficient to sustain interest.<br />But this book isn't as good as Books 2  and 3. Rowling's getting formulaic in her plotting. Voldemort, aided by a  servant, grows stronger. (As he has in books 1 to 3) Foes are out to harm  Porter - but mysterious agents help him survive. Hermione acts secretive  again. There's the obligatory lengthy Quidditch descriptions in the form of  a world-cup, a la Euro 2000. And Porter has a one-on-one encounter with  Voldemort - and yes, survives again. Yawn.<br />The writing's not as taut as  the previous books. Superfluous descriptions ramble on, written obviously  with an eye for the camera. More effort is spent at scene-setting than  narrative, especially in the first one-third of this (734-page) tome.  Porter's fledgling adolescence and teen infatuation is handled somewhat  clumsily. Some chapters read like something from Sweet Valley High,  giggling school girls staking out popular boys and all. Oh, and there's the  obligatory nod to political correctness in the form of a more racially  mixed character cast.<br />This book, frankly, reads like a book in  transition. Maybe 14 is a clumsy year for Porter. Maybe Rowling caved in to  her publisher's suggestions for political correctness; a teen romance, and  a world tournament.<br />I just hope Porter and Rowling grow up more in Book  5 and have the courage to go back to what they do best: spin a ripping good  yarn about good and evil, (hog)warts and all. Get the basic story structure  right, leave the scene setting to the movie producers. This book will still  be a sensation - but largely because it borrows on the fame of the first 3.  By itself, it's flawed. I hope Book 5 next summer won't disappoint.n't disappoint.	2000-07-10

The themes of honor, friendship and bravery  are still idolized.  However, parents should be aware of the darker  contents of this book.  It is hard for readers not to be disappointed  in later books in series.  Many series seem to loose their magic as they go  along.  Readers have high expectations that books often do not live up to.   &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is as exhilarating and  wonderful as any of the earlier books.

The way Rowling writes, one's imagination  comes into play, and in my case, the reader can become immersed in the  book, becoming one of the characters. The interactions between Harry, his  friends, faculty, and others he meets are conceived with skill. Because  Harry acts his age, he is real. In fact, all the characters in the book  have great depth, and it is up to the reader to decide, until the end, whom  Harry can trust.

The new characters (and some old characters) are not what they seem to be  (as usual).  I especially loved all the &quot;social commentary&quot;  packed into this book.  She covers gender bias, classism, racism, and  nationalism...to name only a few. No &quot;preaching&quot;, no lessons  driven down the reader's throats - but gives the reader a chance to see  people interact and struggle with these issues in the magical world.

This fourth outing in the Harry Potter series is the first to suffer from the overwhelming success of the first three. Although it is the longest of the three, it covers the least ground in terms of storyline. While Harry  Potter and the Goblet of Fire has compelling descriptions of the Quidditch  World Cup, as well as a wizardly competition that unleashes many new spells  and creatures, somehow it feels like the series has lost its heart.  Yes,  adolescent angst comes to Harry and his Hogwarts companions,  but it is a  superficial storyline, which somehow feels unworthy of Rowling's talents. A  storyline about the Daily Prophet, the wizarding world's tabloid newspaper  feels like the author's attempt to take a stab at the unwelcome attention  she has received from the press. The book has been described as  &quot;pivotal&quot; but has the unsatisfying feeling of being filler  material rather than having substance. There is a &quot;tune in  tomorrow&quot; quality to book IV that leaves the reader unsatisfied. As a  HUGE fan of the first three books, I may hold the author to impossibly high  standards...but those standards were set by her previous efforts. I will  still look forward to Book V, but with hope that it returns to the heart of  the matter..Harry's quest for identity and for family.	2000-07-10

Harry Potter #4, a gargantuan yet captivating work, keeps you riveted for every one of it's 734 pages.  Goblet of Fire is a lot darker than Rowling's other work, and does seem  aimed to a slightly more mature audience, which works, as it seems in  keeping with the growing maturity of Harry and the other charactors.  That  said, the book retains the charm of the previous 3, with a number of things  to make you chuckle sprinkled throughout the pages. The end is wonderful,  containing several surprises and several confirmations of things that  readers have suspected for the entire series.  What's even better is that  it leaves a lot of openings that will keep Potter fans speculating until  #5, which can't possibly be written soon enough!

It is as gripping and inventive as the first three HP books and the world of Hogwarts is as magical and absorbing as ever.<br />There are some very funny moments (the camping scenes at the Quidditch World Cup, for example), more  stirring words from Dumbledore in the closing pages of the book, but  overall the word for this HP book has got to be 'DARK'! Danger has been  present in each of the HP books of course, but never as menacing as this.  Goblet of Fire is different from the others in that when you reach the end,  you no longer feel that all's right with the world...<br />On a lighter note,  the development of the characters of Ron, Hermione and Harry is excellent.  You really feel they are growing as people and already seem quite different  to the characters we first met on the Hogwarts Express in book one.  Hermione, especially, is getting very strident! There are some awkward  teenage moments too...<br />Having said all that though, I do feel the book is  overlong and is quite slow to start. It really only gets cracking about  half-way through. I absolutely loved Prisoner of Azkaban, and thought it  was one of the best books of 1999 (should have won the Whitbread book of  the year!), and I think this one isn't quite up there with it, so that's  why I give it four stars.	2000-07-10

Book Four of the seven book series is probably the most eagerly anticipated book of the year and it was certainly worth waiting for. Harry, Ron and Hermione are all back at Hogwarts for  their fourth year and this year hold more suprises and problems than last  year! Once again the school has a new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher  known only as Professor 'Mad - Eye' Moody. Sirius Black assumes his role as  Harry's Godfather even whilst on the run and Harry gets to speak to his  late parents. Whilst these books often cheer the heart this latest creation  had me in tears because of its poigniancy. Whilst Rowling could have made  Harry's meeting with his parents incredibly cheesy, what James and Lily  Potter say to their son is heart wrenching stuff.  Not only is this book  sad it also an hystarical tale of the three Gryffindor's first dates. Two  schools come to visit Hogwarts and you can imagine the outcry when the  female students find out that one of them is the infamous Quidditch Player,  Viktor Krum. Plus many Hogwarts students attend The Quidditch World Cup.  This new book is double the size of 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' and each page  is brilliant. The characters are well sculpted and the story line is  typically superb. Rumours are true, I'm afraid: One of the characters does  die. But you'll have to read this fantastic book to find out who.  If you  want to know how great this book is, put it this way: It was released on  Saturday over here, its now Monday afternoon. I watched Pete Sampras play  tennis and that was about the only point at which I could put this  legendary book down. MISS THIS AT YOUR PERIL!	2000-07-10

From the glorious detail of the Quidditch  World Cup, Triwizard Tournament and the Yule Ball to a showdown with  Voldemort. There were many intriguing plot twists to keep you guessing what  is going to happen next. It's very apparent in this book that Harry and his  friends are growing up, internal friction and the discovery of the opposite  sex are being quietly developed along with the plot to give the main  characters a greater depth that adolescents will identify with. There are  plenty of new magic spells and interesting creatures to keep the fantasy  minded well engaged. The book does indeed have a darker feel to it  especially the last third, a character does die and we are given a glimpse  that darker times are coming in future of the series but the tone is still  light enough that younger readers won't be disappointed.	2000-07-10

I was concerned that HP4 would not be worthy of all of the fanfare and anticipation, that the actual book would backfire like a Spellotaped wand. Thank God I was wrong - very wrong!  Harry and Co. endure a fourth year  completely unlike their previous years; their adventures are all new, and  the challenges which they face, from classes and each other, are fresh, but  believable. J.K. Rowling doesn't just tell a story; she writes like she was  there and is just filling you in.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  is peppered with new and entertaining characters, including starchy  ministers, foreign wizards, house-elves, and even a Jack Palance-ish  Defense against the Dark Arts teacher. This is Hogwart's, though; things  are rarely as they seem.  This book is a roller-coaster ride in the dark.  You think you know where the ride is going, a couple of hills, a curve,  then zip! -you're off in a new direction, and then you drop down a huge  hill, then another! Zip! you're going left, and pretty darned fast too! And  another hill! ( How could there be any more hills?) And just when you know  that this may be the best ride ever, you ease in to the station, slightly  stunned but drooling for more....

But, as I got further and further into Harry Potter's latest adventure, the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard  Tournament, it became harder and harder to put the book down.  I would like  to say though that while reading this book I noticed many words, phrases,  and British idioms that would confuse the average ten year old.  I am 17,  and my 12 year old sister has already asked numerous questions referring to  the language within the first few chapters.  Although I believe younger  readers may have trouble with some of the phrases, it does greatly enrich  the novel older readers, making it very worth the 734 pages.  J. K.  Rowling's language usage is also intriguing, and helped to keep me reading.   She has succeeded in her goals of making the story darker, and more  developed.  I was on the edge of my seat for the last 8 chapters (37  total).  The twists that developed in these chapters had me guessing until  the last page.  I was left on the last page with many questions.  Will Lord  Voldemort win?  Will Harry survive?  Will Sirius ever be safe with Harry?   Will Dumbledore ever convince Fudge of the truth?

It took 200 pages for the first exciting plot twist to develop (when Harry is mysteriously entered  into the championship contest). The puzzles and clever foreshadowing that  marked the earlier books seem to have gotten lost. The final 100 pages of  the book includes a number of extended monologues which have the main  characters directly explaining how the plot makes sense rather than the  much more interesting manner of the earlier books in which the pieces fall  into place with only a few choice revelations towards the conclusion.

However, I adored it and found it, despite being  over 700 pages long, entirely too short. It will be a long wait until Book  5-Rowling leaves many threads open for the sequel.

Madame Rowling has told another riveting installment of the young wizard's tale in a whopping 734 pages which all the diehards will buy.  My 13-year-old son and I had a ritual whereby as the books came out I read them aloud to him over the space of a few days,  but this time I ended up synopsising the book and only reading the last  four chapters aloud.  His assessment was &quot;Wow, Mom, the little kids  are going to have nightmares,&quot; with which I agree. I understand that  Ms. Rowling is upping the ante as her perceived audience grows up along  with Harry; Little Orphan Annie this is not.  But she continues to gather 7  and 8-year-old fans as well.  Perhaps a warning on the book: &quot;Caution;  content not necessarily suitable for young children&quot;?

Rowlings is a great storyteller, and all her familiar trademarks are here: the colorful and eccentric characters, the humor, the playful use of words, the  masterful cultivation of suspense. The book is over seven hundred pages  long, but at the end you'll be wishing it were longer. There isn't a slow  spot in it.<br />The story is, however, different in some ways from the  previous ones. It's a lot darker and scarier, for one thing. Voldemort and  his supporters play a prominent role in it, and their malice forms a  palpable undercurrent in the plot from chapter one on. By the end of the  story, you get to see just HOW evil Voldemort and his minions actually are.  And let me tell you, they're pretty evil.<br />The other big  difference is that Harry, Ron, Hermione and their friends are starting to  grow up. The boys and girls have begun to notice each other now, and all  the familiar problems of adolescence--jealousy, insecurity, fear of  rejection, desire to fit in--or stand out--are starting to descend on them.  I enjoy seeing the characters evolve in this way, but those who would  rather they stay eternal 11-year-olds may be disappointed.<br />The story is  not as self-contained as those in the previous books. Many plot lines are  left open at the end, presumably to be resolved in books #5, 6, and 7. If  you think you had a hard time waiting for &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; to  come out, wait till you finish it and are left thinking about the next  one!<br />All in all, I highly recommend this book. If you're already a Harry  Potter fan you won't be disappointed, and if you're not, reading it might  very well make you one.	2000-07-10

First of all, the book  is not only long-awaited, but also LONG.  At 700-0dd pages, it nearly  doubles the length of the first one.  The length of the book is both an  asset and a &quot;short&quot;coming. On one hand, it allows Rawling to  reveal much more about the mysterious wizarding world, about which the  readers previously knew very little.  For example, there are, it turns out,  other wizarding schools. The length also allows Rawlings to fulfill her  promise of bombarding the main characters with hormones, and the effects  are fairly comic as we find that our child-heroes are not children anymore.  Finally, Rawlings inserted many more clues about the future of the series  in this book than in the others.  Not only do we see future battles shaping  up for Harry, Her-my-oh-nee and Ron, but we see _futures_, as well.  Despite all these significant plusses, the book's length fostered some  sloppiness not found in the other three.  Not all the ends were well tied  up--and while it could be argued that they will be in future books,  Rawlings has never needed to resort to that tactic before, preferring to  tightly control _every_ element of the story in tight vignettes that finish  within each book.  The series is beginning to read more like a series than  a series of novels. (Examples of un-or-poorly-tied-ends are SPEW,  Nelville's history, the function of the bubopus, and others that I can't  reveal without revealing the ending).  Finally, some of the early events in  the novel lose their significance by the end of the book, even though they  are crucial to figuring out &quot;whodunnit.&quot;  By the time the  perpetrator of the Death Mark is revealed, we've forgotten how important  the Death Mark was.  Stronger editing would have solved this problem more  satisfactorily. But, then again, who's complaining--more Harry Potter is  what the world wants..

I'd really like to give this book 3 1/2 stars--it's not good enough for 4 but not bad enough for 3.  The final 200 pages are very good, but the first 500  feel padded and logy, especially the Quidditch World Cup, which goes on for  the better part of 80 pages and only involves Harry tangentially (my  suspicion is that Rowling ran into her deadline and didn't have time to  edit properly). The confrontation that spans Chapters 32 - 34 is very good  and just about worth the price of admission.  But I think it's a bit of a  cruelty to children to ask them to work their way through 734 pages to get  there; I don't know if I would have had that kind of patience when I was  12. Minor points: what kind of &quot;tournament&quot; stretches out over 6  months? Since two of the other players in the tournament are students from  other schools, we're asked to believe that they spend the better part of a  year as exchange students at Hogwarts--but they don't take classes; isn't  this a hole in the story?  I'd comment on the death in chapter 32, but I  don't want to reveal details that would spoil the story for other readers  (but I think it's another case of too much fuss and hype).

Like in the previous  volumes, Harry and his friends must fight Dark Magic, without knowing for  sure who they can trust.  Highlights include Hermoine's campaign to help  house elves and Percy Weasley's new job, which makes him even more self  important than he was as a prefect.

The 4th year at Hogwart's brings more characters and more complexity to the tale of Harry and his world.  It was like putting on a favorite comfortable coat and finding $100 in the pocket. I was concerned that it might be a letdown after 3 great books and the incredible promotion campaign. WRONG !  This is a furious flight and I, for one, kept thinking, &quot;One more chapter, one more chapter&quot; all night long. Harry's development as a young man and as a wizard is exciting and gratifying.  Be sure to read the books in order as each builds on the previous one.  The only bad moment for me was when I realized that there were only a few pages left before this installment was over.

This volume opens with a Quidditch championship and then goes into year four at Hogwarts for Harry, Ron and Hermione. (One thing I really like in IV is we learn how to pronounce Hermione, her-MY-oh-nee). Year IV has the  usual plotting and mayhem involving dark wizards, as well as some romantic  intrigues for all of the major characters, a compelling wizarding contest,  and some hilarious sublots involving a scandal-sheet journalist named Rita  Skeeter, a revelation abour Hagrid, some political agitation on the part of  Hermione, and a business venture of Fred and George.<br />I can't imagine any  fan really needs to consult these user reviews, wondering if she or he will  go ahead an buy it, but I'm pleased to report that this one is not only not  disappointing, but the best yet.<br />Harry Potter IV is a major achievement  for children's books. For a 750-page, darkly themed book where a major  character dies to be so tremendously successful might open the minds of  publishers and encourage writers to explore possibilities instead of  following patterns.<br />For years children's books have been fitting narrower  and narrower niches: one-sit reads and simple sentence structure everyone  thought made a book more salable, and an unbearable lightness except in  &quot;problem novels.&quot;<br />J.K. assumes kids have the interest and  attention span to handle longish books with dry humor and dark themes; even  books about a complex imaginary world with a specialized vocabulary and an  ornate set of rules. She also assumes children won't be confused by real  problems (like poverty and the death of parents) being combined with humor  and fantasy.<br />Rowling is a great writer who knows how to execute a  plotline and reveal characters through dialogue and action, but her  greatest gift is her high regard for the intelligence of her readers. And  kids are delighted to prove that she's right on the mark.	2000-07-10

For my generation, this would be one of our biggest influences in  solving moral dilemmas, learning right from wrong, etcetera.  The Star Wars  saga is still alive and well among us, but the generation on my heels has a  new source of myth, and it is, naturally, J.K. Rowling and the astounding  universe she has created for young wizard-in-training, Harry Potter.<br />Upon  finishing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I can say definitively that  Rowling has done something I never would have expected.  She has added more  drama and emotional resonance to this already engaging and exciting, now  middle-aged series.  The stakes are higher this time around for Harry and  his friends and at the conclusion of the book it seems that they show no  sign of lowering any time soon.<br />I am loathe to give away any of the  trademark shocks and surprises that Rowling has in store for the devoted  reader, suffice to say that they are just as involving and head-slappingly  clever as they have always been.<br />And as was evident in the last book, the  emotional weight of the series is quickly taking hold.  There were several  times when Harry and his adventures transcended the mere thrill of reading  a good adventure, and I found myself fearing for the safety, not of a  character in a book, but rather a brave young man who had come to life  right under my nose, without me even noticing.  From abject terror to  hearbreaking sadness, this reader felt like he was looking through the same  pair of hornrimmed glasses as the protaganist.  And there is something to  be said, prose-wise, for Ms. Rowling's deft use of perspective, keeping it  effortlessly behind the eyes of Harry even without ever stretching the  narrative to first person.  I hadn't noticed until about page 600 this time  around, but the reason that there's so much suspense in these books is that  almost all of the time (there are a few clever uses of dramatic irony in  Book 4) we know only what Harry knows.<br />In addition, Rowling adds even  more detail to the ridiculously imaginative universe of Muggles and  Wizardry, taking on journalism and professional sports in the Wizard World  this time with unflaggingly imaginative flair.<br />I can't applaud J.K.

JK Rowling's interlaced world of wizards and muggles (the rest of us, for those not yet initiated) grows along with the main character - Harry  Potter - the now fourteen year old wizard-in-training at Hogwarts School  for Witchcraft and Wizardy.  All the supporting cast of characters is back  - his best friend Ron Weasley and his large family, his friend (not  girlfriend) Hermione, Headmaster Dumbledore and the teachers, students and  other entities at Hogwarts (both good and bad). And, of course, the evil  Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named) is back.  New characters include  various members of the Ministry of Magic, another new Hogwarts teacher of  Defense Against the Dark Arts and the students and their headmaster and  headmistress of two Continental wizardry schools, who compete against  Hogwarts in the Triwizard Tournament and add a bit of romance to the  Hogwarts scene.  There are some revelations about the history and origins  of known characters and new plot twists and turns that mix seamlessly with  the fun of the familiar world already present in the previous three books.  The first chapter is ominous and foreboding, not to be taken  lightly or read alone at midnight - particularly not by preteens. The book  opens with &quot;The Riddle House&quot; and ends with &quot;The  Beginning.&quot;  And a beginning it is, there are three more Harry Potter  books to come.  This book is both an introduction and a setup for what is  to come, but, like it predecessors, it is satisfying by itself.<br />  Could a reader jump in to this book without reading the first three?  Maybe, I read the last three books a year ago, but I believe, JK Rowling  does a masterful job of reintroducing the important facts contained in the  previous three books without either slowing the action or losing the  reader's interest.  For those who have read Tolkien, consider the first  three books akin to &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; and this volume the first book  in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.  The Hobbit is not necessary  to &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; but why miss the fun?<br /> Should  this book be read by some of the very young readers who have enjoyed the  previous Harry Potter books?  Anecdotally, as a child of eight, I saw the  Walt Disney movie &quot;Old Yeller,&quot; and was very disturbed by the  tragic ending.  I can't watch that movie to this day.

The entire wizarding world are proud of his new accomplishments. If you love Harry, Ron, Hermonie and the rest of the Hogwarts staff and students this is the best one yet!

It was delivered to my doorstep on Saturday morning and I finally finished it Monday at 2:00 A.M.  Another winner for J.K. Rowling.  The twists and turns of Harry's adventures continue in this exciting book.  From the beginning at the International Quidditch Cup, the story constantly  keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.  Harry, now in his fourth year  at Hogwarts, is reunited with his friends Ron and Hermoine.  Their  adventures begin when it is announced that Quidditch will not be played  this year but instead one student from each of three school of Witchcraft  and Wizardry (Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang) will participate in an  event not held in recent years, the Triwizard Tournament.  Through no fault  of his own Harry becomes the fourth entrant in this tournament.  The book  follows Harry through his classes, his preparation for competition, and  yes, even his first dance.  I won't tell you the ending, but it is very  tense.  Rowling has another winner on her hands.  Now I'll be waiting by  the door for the delivery of Harry Potter V.	2000-07-10

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is easily the best in the Harry Potter series.  Harry, Hermoine and Ron return for another thrill ride, with Harry in the classic mythic tradition of a hero with a Quest.  In Goblet of Fire,  we meet wizards and witches from countries other than Great Britain.  We  are introduced to a host of new characters, both friends and foes, and  these characters are as deliciously distinct and true-to-life as Rowling's  previous creations.  There are revelations about the pasts of characters we  love and characters we love to hate.  Both a beloved friend of Harry's and  a servant of &quot;You-Know-Who&quot; are present from the beginning of  Goblet of Fire. The plot's twists and turns are as tidy and unpredictable  as ever.  In short, Harry Potter is everything we have come to love about  the series and more, literally and figuratively.  Those 734 pages are  packed full of all the action, excitement, humor, and drama of the rest of  the series.  Although there are hints at the maturation of the young  heroes, they will likely be lost on readers under 11 or 12.  Further, the  &quot;scary&quot; factor has been racheted up a notch, making the book  unsuitable for the very young (If you're a reader of Tolkien, this can be  compared to the difference between The Hobbit and Return of the King.).  I  will not hesitate to let my 9 year old read Goblet of Fire, but I will  probably wait a year or two to read it to my not quite 6 year old.  Still,  as an adult reader of the series, I devoured the 734 pages in less than two  days, as &quot;unput-downable&quot; as any book I have ever read.  I  laughed out loud at Rowling's humor and cried buckets near the end.  One  word of warning to any who have not read the prior books - many secrets  from books I through III are reviewed in Goblet of Fire, so this is one  book that should not be read out of sequence.  (The other three need not be  read in sequence.)  Otherwise, read, enjoy, and wait another whole year for  Book V!year for  Book V!	2000-07-10

This installment  in the epic stories of our young hero, Harry Potter, is perhaps the most  spectacular and awe inducing yet... Harry, having gone through most of the  summer with the vile Dursleys, get the opportunity to go the the Quidditch  World Cup with Ron and Hermione. A fantastic game of Quidditch, however, is  not all they see. One of Voldemort's previous followers has sent up the  Dark Mark- Voldemort's personalized sign, calling all of his followers-  'Death Eaters' to him. This event is only the first in many that take place  and draw Harry into more dangerous situations than he has ever encountered  before. It seems that this particular year, the Triwizard Tournament will  take place at Hogwarts. This competition tests the skills and bravery of  student from three magic schools- Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons.  The students to compete are chosen by the mysterious Goblet of Fire, which  measures the worth of wizards to partake in the event. When the names are  chosen, a stunning event takes place- yes, it's true- Harry is chosen to  participate in the competition, although he never entered his name and was  much too young to compete. Bound by the laws of the tournament, Harry has  to compete against the other champions. But has Harry simply had some  stroke of luck? Or did someone, something, put Harry's name in the Goblet-  someone who wanted him dead? As the tournament begins, startling  revelations and events take place, involving Hagrid, dragons, merpeople,  and perhaps the best of all- Malfoy as a ferret. The whole mystery reaches  an intense and horrifying climax that will have you clutching the book and  gasping for breath. My advice: Ease the pangs of Harry withdrawal and read  this book. If you have never read any of the Harry Potter books, then grab  the first one and catch up as fast as you can. Any new installment in  Harry's life- particulary this one- is one you DO NOT want to miss.ks, then grab  the first one and catch up as fast as you can.

I suppose I ought to state at the outset that I'm a 27-year-old fan of the series.  I confess that when I first found out how long this book was going to be, I was a bit concerned.  In some ways, it's easier to write a long  novel than a short one, and I was afraid that perhaps, just perhaps,  Rowling had opted for quickly writing a more sprawling book, rather than  taking the time to make it tighter.<br />I needn't have worried.<br />This book  is longer, yes, but it never drags, and seems remarkably free of padding.  It has more events taking place and a more intricate plot... and it sets  the stage for what's to come, which I'm looking forward to reading.

I read &quot;...the Goblet...&quot; in less than 24 hours, and  was enchanted every minute. From the very first chapter, I was hooked: Lord  Voldemort was back.  I was captivated by the idea of a Triwizard Tournament  between Hogwarts School, Durmstrang Institute, and Beauxbatons Academy, and  when Harry's name was mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire as a fourth  contender, I knew that Harry Potter book #4 was clearly the best of the  bunch. The bizarre twists and turns along the chapters had me guessing what  on earth Rowling would think of next. Just when I though I had it figured  out, Cedric Diggory was suddenly killed by Lord Voldemort, after he and  Harry both grabbed the handles of the Triwizard Cup (which turned out to be  a magic transportation device called a Portkey leading the two champions  directly to Lord Voldemort himself!). The book leaves us knowing Voldemort  is back and stronger than in previous encounters. J.K. Rowling continues to  surprise and astound me, and I am positive her next book in the Potter  series will be anything but dissapointing! I can't wait!	2000-07-10

The story and the language are surely approachable for a nine year old, but I'm 39,  and astounded.<br />Second, after all the hype surrounding the release I was  prepared to be disappointed.  Instead I was entranced.  This is a long but  compelling story, and if anything it needed to be longer.<br />Still a bit  adrift without a family of his own, Harry finds himself in the middle of a  contest he didn't seek, in the midst of a battle he didn't start.  Confused  about both, unsure of his own ability, at the limits of his wits and  stamina, he perserveres.<br />Rowling looks at friendship and leadership, the  elusiveness of truth, and courage.  The only weak thread in the book is an  abortive exploration of slavery.  The most amusing thread is a look at a  reporter whose stories bear only the faintest resemblence to reality.  The  most difficult thread is death.  Yes, there is death in this story, from  the very first chapter to nearly the end.  But  none of the deaths are  without purpose, and even in death good souls fight on against  evil.<br />Ultimately the theme of this book is one that every twelve year old  needs to understand:  With courage, good does conquer evil, but sometimes  at a very great price.	2000-07-10

After fifty minutes of fighting a large, overly excited, cloaked and costumed crowd of young Harry Potter fans and their parents Friday night at midnight, I finally had my copy of the latest Potter story!  My mind was  reeling with the same questions.  What would Harry do?  Who would be the  new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher? How can I someday be as wise as  Albus Dumbledore? Would Hermione score seven hundred percent on every test?  But the foremost question in my mind was &quot;could Jo Rowling live up to  the wonderful quality of writing and storytelling that is her first three  books in the series?&quot;  Let me tell you, she did.  In my opinion, the  content, the seamless plot, and the amazingly developed characters combine  for the best book of the series, if not the best book of the year so far.  I will give away none of the plot, but rest assured, this is the best  Potter book yet.  I have friends who were worried about the length of the  book.  I finished the 700 plus pages in a little over 36 hours.  The  writing is so wonderfully concise, and the story so intriguing, you hardly  notice the length of the book.  Jo Rowling proves herself a seer, a born  storyteller and a champion of imagination.  One interesting aspect of the  series is that the characters grow up as they go along.  They experience  more mature emotions, more tests on their morals and their problems become  more serious the older they get.  The fourth book seems to have lost some  of the puerility of the first three; however, as much as we would like to,  we can't keep Harry, Hermione, Ron and company young forever.  If you have  any vacillation whatsoever about buying the book due to the slightly higher  cover price, or the length, abandon it and purchase this book immediately!  The only regret you will have about Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, is  that it was over much too soon.	2000-07-10

It is official . . . with the release of the fourth of seven books that make up this mystifying Epic, J.K. Rowling has established herself as arguably the most spectacular creative writer working today.  For the  fourth time, Rowling has composed a plot of such impermeable solidity that  one cannot help but to become spellbound with awe at her unquestionable  literary genius.  In this novel, Harry Potter shows definite signs of  acquiring much mental, physical, and magical maturity.  Along with help  from his good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns  invaluable lessons pertaining to stealing golden eggs from deadly  Horn-tailed dragons, battling evil wizards who want to kill him, and, yes,  Harry even begins to notice what was once to him an elusive species of  magical animal: Girls! And maturity is what Harry desperately needs, for  his antipode of power--the all-evil Lord Voldemort--finds a way to come  back to power.  But not only has You-Know-Who found a way to attain rebirth  through a rite of horrible wickedness; He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has, too,  found a way to overcome his one weakness . . . no longer does the Power of  Love, which Harry's mother bestowed opon her son with her fatal sacrifice,  protect Harry from Voldemort.  Therefore, Voldemort is back, and he is even  more horrible than he has ever been.  Hold on to your broomsticks, Potter  fans!  For this is the pivotal Potter book that will leave readers sitting  on the edge of their Firebolts desperately awaiting the next Hogwarts  school year in which the protectors of what is Good hope to unite so to  thwart Voldemort and his Death Eaters' potential reign of destruction.	2000-07-10

This book substantially develops ongoing plot threads from  prior books and creates new twists and turns to delight, puzzle, and amaze  the reader.<br />Harry Potter arrives at Hogwarts expecting a  &quot;typical&quot; fourth-year school experience.  Even before he reaches  school, he finds that his fourth year at Hogwarts is to be anything but  typical.  Harry is mistakenly thrust into an inter-school competition  between Hogwarts and its French and German counterparts (Beauxbatons and  Durmstrang).  What starts out as a seemingly innocent contest soon takes on  a more sinister tone, leading to a shattering climax that soon proves to be  the beginning of yet another saga in Harry Potter's life.<br />This volume  really starts to &quot;flesh out&quot; the Harry Potter Universe's history.  We learn more about Sirius Black, Headmaster Dumbledore, Hagrid, and Lord  Voldemort.  Romance touches Harry's life, although this is only one aspect  of an incredibly complex novel.  Several new characters are introduced, and  I look forward to seeing how they develop in future installments.<br />Without  giving away any of the plot secrets, it's safe to say that this, the fourth  (and middle) book of the seven-book series, sets up the reader for an  incredible series of events to be revealed in remaining volumes.  The most  difficult thing about this book (other than my hands getting tired - it's  HEAVY) was trying to put it down.<br />One minor note of caution to parents  and teachers: this is the most serious book in the series so far.

My 11 year old had read the entire 700 pages by the next day.  I, myself, stayed awake till 4:00 AM to read it.<br />So, get plenty of sleep before reading this book. You won't sleep  until you finish.<br />And you might not sleep well afterwards either.  Because, unlike the first 3 Harry Potter books, this one contains at least  one very dark and horrid scene.<br />Harry is tied to Voldemort's father's  tomb while Voldemort performs a bloody ritual.  A fellow student and friend  is killed, although not (thank God) by human sacrifice.<br />But if this scene  is necessary, and it is, then it is written with the proper disgust and  horror which should accompany it.<br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  shares the strengths of the earlier books in the series.  The secret  villian is a surprise, the characters are real, the plot is believable.  It  has some additional virtues.  It is long, but never boring. The budding  romances are not cliched yet leave the plot uncluttered.<br />The twists of  characterization continue and increase.  At least one hateful character is  beautifully redeemed and a few good characters display questionable  tendencies.<br />Two minor characters display subtle depth. One man brings  sorrow on himself and his family by forgetting morality in his fight  against evil.  Another desires comfort and familiarity too greatly and so  ignores plainly displayed evil.<br />The Globlet of Fire is not a standalone  book.  Like Tolkien's &quot;The Two Towers&quot; it is neither the first  nor the last in the series to read.<br />I will be in line at 12:01 AM waiting  for next Harry Potter installment.	2000-07-10

Rowling does it again--the same fine descriptive prose, exciting action, amazing monsters, page-turning climax, and of course, a gentle lesson at the end.<br />As you all know, someone does indeed die but it's not  who you expect.  As usual, someone close to Harry attempts to hurt him, and  as usual it's not who you expect. And with the nasty turn of events near  the end you might expect the tone to become dark.  It remains hopeful and  courageous to the finish.<br />The gratifying thing about this series is that  it keeps getting better--you won't be disappointed in Goblet of Fire; in  fact you'll be glad that it's almost 750 pages so it will last at least a  few under-the-sheets-with-the-flashlight nights.<br />How long do we have to  wait for the next one?	2000-07-10

But when I put down the book for the night, I turned my light on ten minutes later because I  HAD to finish the book.  From the first page, this volume of Harry's life  possesses a different tone, but soon we are &quot;apparated&quot; back into  the &quot;normal&quot; life of Harry Potter--the life of the Dursleys,  quidditch, and Ron and Hermione.  But not without so many questions:  why  does Harry's scar hurt? what should the students of Hogwarts be excited  about the upcoming term? why so many thoughts about death? The readers of  the previous three volumes will be surprised with all the new characters,  including the Defense Against Dark Arts professor who is as mysterious as  his predecessors.  We also meet wizards and soon-to-be-wizards from lands  far away when they all arrive to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.  As  well as meeting these characters, we learn more about the characters we  thought we knew so intimately--including Hagrid, Neville, and Dumbledore.  Rowling continues to surprise her readers with plot-twists and revelations.  I form my own opinions and predictions about how the novel will end, and  I'm never right! Like a great horror/who-dunnit movie, she keeps you  guessing, and when you think you have it all figured out, she reveals the  truth--all of which she has been alluding to and dropping hints, but done  so in such a clever manner.  This novel isn't as psychological as the  others in the series, but it is just as wonderful.  Rowling, as well as  describing the magical so beautifully, also shows how confused  fourteen-year-olds can be when our favorite triumvirate attends the Yule  Ball.  Harry defeated He-Who-Cannot-Be-Named, but can he ask a girl out?  J.K. Rowling created a portkey when she wrote her Harry Potter novels.  All  I can say is when will the fifth volume be published?	2000-07-10

Well, I must start this review by saying that I am not 9 or even 12.  I am a twenty-seven year old who recently returned to grad school.<br />I started Year 4 on Saturday morning.  I read, almost non-stop, all day long  literally glued to the book (resenting any of the banal trivialities of  life--i.e. food, commitments, etc. that took me away from it) until at 9:30  p.m. Saturday night I reached the riveting last page.<br />In my opinion, this  is the best book of the series (I recently re-read books 1-3 to regain a  sense of continuity). Rowling continues to grow and develop the  characters--Hermione becomes an object of desire for both new and old  characters; Harry and Ron struggle with the awkwardness of growing boys to  develop new relationships with girls and to deal with the expression of  their feelings for the girls around them.  Fred and George begin to prepare  for life after Hogwarts in a way which provides a lot of fun and amusement.  Draco Malfoy gets a come-uppance in one of the funniest ways impossible (I  laughed out loud delightedly).<br />In this book, Harry Potter struggles with  his fame--he almost loses friendships because of it, and he has to deal  with the vicious press.  He encounters an unscrupulous reporter who  attempts to destroy both his reputation and the reputations of others close  to him.<br />Of course, Voldemort is again back trying to regain power.  The  whole book has a sinister undertone because of the question about who in  Hogwarts in helping him.  The clues are sparse so the reader is left with a  sense of dread.<br />This book does contain death, but the impact of the  death is mitigated by Harry's nobleness in dealing with it.<br />The best part  of this book is that it leaves me hungering for another. Late developments  in the book with Cornelius Fudge and Severus Snape leave plenty of chaos to  be mopped in the next book.  In fact, at the end of book four, the future  looks very bleak for good wizards and witches.<br />Like the others, the rich  description and humor of the book as well as the real-life parallels make  the place and time come alive. Hagrid, Dumbledore, the Weasleys, Sirius  Black, and all our other favorites are back, better than ever.Like the others, the rich  description and humor of the book as well as the real-life parallels make  the place and time come alive.

Even at over 700 pages, this one will leave you longing for more.  As Harry Potter grows, so does Rowling's narrative style.  This book -- like its hero -- seems much more grown up than the others, both in themes and narrative style.  Yet, it's  still an adventure that all ages can enjoy, with moments of thrilling  action, tense danger, and deep pathos.<br />The author has a really good feel  for what it's like to be a budding teenager -- even a teenager at a  boarding school for wizards.<br />We get to see students from other schools in  this one -- which lends a larger dimension to the tale.  The relationships  between the cast members become more complex as well.  With much of her  background established, Rowling feels free to delve into her world more  fully.<br />I've read (and worked on) fantasy books and games for 20 years,  but Rowling's world still feels fresh and exciting to me.

This is the much-anticipated book that had me waiting in lineat midnight to buy, even with my online order pending, and it wasworth every minute of the waiting and wondering (and hyper-active media coverage.) I flipped pages all weekend long, torn between making it last and ripping through it.  Well, as evidenced by this review, my impatient side won out and I read it all in a weekend!<br />I enjoyed this book immensely -- it felt like two books in one. I am so impressed with the author for not holding back and trying to squeeze two books out of this one -- the hard work put into this huge tome shows.<br />Unlike her first three books, this one does not start on Harry's birthday. Instead, it starts out with a very dark and scary scene and the murder of a Muggle. I liked the fact that this book did not follow the same &quot;formula&quot; as the previous three. Yes, it's pretty dark and scary, but the suspense and surprises are things I've come to enjoy and appreciate about these books. What a great twist ending!<br />The Quidditch World Cup is imaginative -- and as an American, I enjoyed the &quot;international&quot; feel to this part of the book. Rowling opens our eyes to every other part of the worlds -- both her Muggle and Wizard worlds. The mascot and souvenir descriptions are wonderful and so imaginative. You feel like you're there beside Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drinking the scene in.<br />I was afraid the house-elf &quot;anti-slavery&quot; campaign would turn preachy but there was a nice touch (light-handed, really) on a potentially controversial topic. Long live SPEW! :) I also wondered if the Rita Skeeter commentary was about the over-active media but I laughed and cheered with the characters at it all.  Great touches.<br />I also enjoyed how Rowling worked in the pronunciation of Hermione's name -- Her-my-oh-nee. Hooray! I saw a BookTV Q&amp;A session last fall so I was privvy to this info, but I loved the clever way she put it in the book.<br />Run, don't walk, to your web browser and order this book!

Parents of younger  readers should be warned:  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;  is darker and scarier than any of the other books.  I would advise parents  to at least skim some of the later chapters before allowing their children  to read them.  I personally feel that none of this is too dark or  frightening for young readers. The themes of honor, friendship and bravery  are still idolized.  However, parents should be aware of the darker  contents of this book.  It is hard for readers not to be disappointed  in later books in series.  Many series seem to loose their magic as they go  along.  Readers have high expectations that books often do not live up to.  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is as exhilarating and  wonderful as any of the earlier books.  For me, the only disappointment is  having to wait another year to read Harry's further adventures.	2000-07-10

I, for one, enjoy getting a chance to solve a riddle  much like the logic problem in the first book.<br />As an adult I enjoy the  simplicity of falling into a consistent universe of imagination and  escapism.  I haven't found any 'deeper' meaning like Alice in Wonderland.  Rowlings keeps her points out in the open - the power of friendship, the  benefit of cooperation, the traps of bias and prejudice, and overall, good  over evil.<br />The cheating and nasty rudeness seems more evident than ever.  It's a lesson that brings me up short on recommending this story to those  kids who might be approaching their first youth book.  The size may  intimidate them, hopefully.  But for older kids which find this tame to the  reality of school life today - it's great escapism.	2000-07-10

But away from school, a series of bizarre  events and unexplained disappearances are leading danger closer to  Hogwarts, and to Harry. The atmosphere is one of unease - despite the  humour, this is a dark story, but in a league above even the first three  books.  There are many new characters, and the length allows the existing  characters to be better developed.  The plot is complicated and always  unexpected.  The book reaches a chilling climax, as Harry faces the  greatest ordeal of his life - and a tragedy occurs that will leave the  stoniest hearted of readers in tears.  But be warned - just when you think  the excitement is over, the worst is still to come.  The ending is not a  satisfactory one - so much is yet to come!  Roll on book 5!	2000-07-10

J.K. Rowling is truly a literary genius as she elaborates her  magnificent story-telling abilities in this charming novel. Harry Potter  rejoins his two best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and they make  their way through their Fourth Year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry. And although filled with humor and friendship, there are some  extraordinary changes in the daily life at Hogwarts (that is, more  extraordinary than usual). Unlike the first three Books, the Inter-House  Quidditch Matches have been cancelled and there is no Cheerful ending.  Harry Potter Fans have known for months that deaths would start in Book IV,  and Rowling isn't one to lie. Harry Potter is forced to show courage like  he has never shown before because this year, the adventure is fraught with  danger.  Danger that Harry has a secret enemy close by, Danger that Harry  wasn't supposed to face, and Danger that Harry doesn't even realize is  approaching..... But can he survive?<br />Come enjoy the exciting Quidditch  World Cup, the comedic antics of the Muggle-Dursleys, and the mysterious  event being held at Hogwarts this year. I assure you, this Book will not  leave you dissapointed.	2000-07-10

This book was very dark, much darker and scarier than any of the other three.  I would not recommend reading it to young children, especially before bed.  It put much more emphasis on Voldemort's old supporters, the  Death Eaters, than ever before.  We find out who they were, with some  surprises, and how some of them got out of going to Azkaban.  Many find  themselves in an awkward position when Voldemort is on the rise again.  The  first chapter is entirely focused on Voldemort and Harry is not metioned at  all.  Secondly, there were deaths in this book, one which is a student at  Hogwarts.  Through this book we come to better understand the situation  before Voldemort's downfall, the terror, the chaos, and the uncertainty of  not knowing who was on your side and who was really supporting the Dark  Lord. <br />But despite, or perhaps because of that, this book is in my  opinion the best in the series.  It is certainly the longest at 700+ pages.   There is lots of laughs, lots of andventure, and lots of hilarious  attempts at romance.  Its not too mushy though, don't worry.  Its not all  dark and scary though.  Harry goes to the Quiddich World Cup with the  Weasleys, he and Ron have an interesting time finding dates for the Yule  Ball, He Ron and Hermione have happy times hanging out in the common room,  and there's plenty of comic relief provided by Fred and George Weasley.   There are lots of funny new characters too.  An extremely paranoid new  Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, an annoyingly nosy Daily Prophet  reporter, students from the other two school for Wizardry in  Europe-Beaubaxtons and Durmstrang, and a World Cup Quidditch player in love  with Hermione. I laughed out loud many times while reading this book.<br />No  book is perfect and though these are great I have a few problems.  First of  all does everybody have a secret they never tell Harry? It always seems  that he, and we are always the last to know.  Why does Harry get  everything?  In thisbook he gets to be the second champion from Hogwarts  and compete in the Triwizard Tournement.  He wins everything and sometimes  I just want him to lose for a change.  For this reason I was actually  rooting partialy for Cedric Diggory in the tournement.  What is up with  Viktor Krum suddenly being in love with Hermione.  I don't understand it.   Nothing against Hermione but she isn't breathlessly gorgeous.  Viktor Krum  is about eighteen, and she is fourteen, thats kind of sick.  Then on top of  that, Cedric Diggory is in love with Cho Chang who is also much younger  than his is.  Is this just the way wizards are?<br />But all and all this was  a great book that everyone should definately read!  Buy it today!	2000-07-10

I manage to  convince myself that this time I really am clever enough to predict the  ending.  Ms. Rowling has again astounded me with her brilliance.<br />The  Goblet of Fire greatly extends and deepens this epic story of the fight  between good and evil.  If the Harry Potter series has not yet ensured it's  place among the ranks of The Lord of the Rings, and The Narnia epics, it  has done so with this book.<br />Ms. Rowling's writing, as always, is  incredibly detailed, drawing us into Harry's delightful world.  I  especially marveled over the description of the Harry's situation, and  feelings in chapter twenty, The First Task.  Of course, the climax was  incredibly depicted, leaving me shaking with anticipation, crying, and  laughing, by turns.  The ending, as rumored, is scary . . . delightfully  so.  Children may be frightened, but not without being heartened by the  bravery, warmth, hope, and love that the characters on the side of good  exude.<br />I am so glad that Ms. Rowling shares her talent for creating  beauty, mystery, and magic with all of us.  I wait anxiously for Harry's  next adventure.  How are Harry, Ron, and Hermione going to work out their  increasingly changing and complex relationships?  How will our friends  battle the evil that is will threaten their world?  How will the characters  from outside of Hogwarts and England be involved?<br />- 21 year-old future  teacher, and unabashed lover of children's literature	2000-07-10

However, having let my 9 year old  daughter read the first three on her own, there is no way I can let her  read this one by herself.  The cruelty in this one, as well as the graphic  description of a self mutilation, and the thinly disguised comparison of  the The Dark One's followers and Nazi's make me really hesitate to let her  read this one on her own.

It reads fast and well. New characters join the cast, some evil some good,  all fascinating. Harry and Ron discover girls and Hermione gets discovered  by boys. It seems that teen age is dawning and the magic is getting more  complex. I especially liked the lesson on the Defense Against the Dark Arts  course where Harry is fighting off a &quot;forbidden&quot; curse that  controls his mind. Evil magic is defeated by strength of will- I bet Harry  can teach a few things on how to fight drugs and peer pressure.  J.K  Rowlings wields her own magic wand with a sure hand. It is impressive how  she can make us grieve for Harry's lost parents time and time again. This  book also ends on a shockingly grim note: The evil side is up and the good  side is licking new wounds. Still, all characters remain fully developped,  resonating with both magic and humanity.  I especially appreciate the  manner in which she brings all aspects of human nature into play,  attributes them to different characters and weaves them tightly into the  plot. Yet,the author never preaches, never assumes a condescending tone.  She won't underestimate our intelligence whether we be children or adults.<br />This book (like the others before it) represents creative, intelligent  writing of high caliber.<br />Only one question remains: Do we really have to  wait another year for Harry Potter book 5?

In reading the series, I have enjoyed watching Harry and his friends grow and deal with more complicated situations, both among themselves and  against the forces of the evil Voldemort.  Now, with the fourth book,  Rowling pulls out all stops.  Not only do the young characters continue to  develop (both as typical teens and as magic-users), not only is the plot  richly layered and full of Rowling's characteristic misdirection, not only  is there more action than fifty Quidditch matches, but the 700+ page book  never lags as detail after imaginative detail is produced, making the world  of Harry Potter even more vivid to the reader.<br />Rowling promised that this  book would be darker than before, and she wasn't kidding.  Nasty things  happen and people die, including important ones.  Betrayal can come from  any direction.  Harry discovers that people supposedly on the same side can  disagree profoundly, to the point of losing one's advantage.<br />The main  plotline of the book is neatly wrapped up with the end of the school year,  but Rowling leaves so many openings for the next book that there is bound  to be another Harry-watch for book 5 before the dust settles on the current  stampede.  And if book 5 is anything like book 4, it will be just as worth  the wait.	2000-07-10

There were only a few things with this book that rather annoyed me, but they were small and didn't detract from the novel.<br />First of all, it's dictionary-sized. As well, Harry does not actually get to Hogwarts until about 175 pages into it. It really didn't matter though, because he was with Ron's family at the Quidditch World Cup. There are also two chapters about the Yule Ball in the middle that I thought lagged a bit but other than that, this novel was full steam ahead the entire way through.<br />The book has a great plot, as usual, and the ending wraps things up perfectly.  This book is definitely just as good, if not better, than the other three novels in this series. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a great read, and will keep most kids happy for a month, based on its size. Of course, with the older kids like me, it'll only keep us busy for a couple of days.  But, of course, we'll read it again because the Harry Potter books are all better the second time around.<br />nyias	2000-07-10

This book is most undoubtedly the best book in the Harry Potter series so far.  I read it for 2 days straight until I finished, I couldn't put it down!

This book, as are all of the Harry Potter books, was excellent. J.K. Rowling is a wonderful fantasy author. Extremely suspenseful and dramatic, it kept me guessing all the time. It was kind of freaky/scary and there was  a lot more in there about the Dark Arts than in her other books. I had not  really expected that. The writing didn't really fit with the rest of the  series--it was much more of a dramatic adventure story than a fun-filled,  entertaining fantasy, like the other ones were. I, however, still enjoyed  it immensely and cannot wait for the fifth one in the series.<br />How anyone  could want to ban her writing is beyond me. Her writing is fantasy and her  readers are quite aware of that. The messages in her books about Magic are  not violent and are really not worth the fuss and complaints that people  are putting up about them. Fiction and fantasy are written for a reason:  for entertainment. People who read fantasy know that. <br />I really enjoy her  writing and I wish people would be more sensible about litature.	2000-07-10

Also I was worried that Harry Potter dealing with girls would be incredibly stupid, spending pages while main characters stumbled around members of the opposite sex, making complete fools of themselves (I've seen it done in too many books before).

I am happy to report that such is  definitely NOT the case.  The Goblet of Fire is a massive read, yet it  pulls you in from the first page, and will not release its hold until the  last.  Harry is as charismatic as ever, adrift in insecurity and anchored  by basic goodness.  The book is indeed darker than its predecessors, but  Rowling knows the limits of her youngest audience and never places their  sensibilities in harm's way.  There are new, intriguing, and delightful  characters, with hints of recurring roles in the future.  The adventures  are exciting, and never trite or hackneyed.

Also, Harry is still in contact with his Godfather  Sirius Black. After the World Cup, Harry learns of Voldemort's followers,  known as the Death Eaters, and their treacherous past. Thereafter, Harry  finds himself back at Hogwarts and learning about the Triwazard Tournament  were a champion from Hogwarts, and the other two schools Beauxabatons and  Durmstrang, compete in assorted tasks. To everyone's surprise, Harry is  picked as a fourth champion. Even Harry is unsure about how he was selected  for the Tournament. Despite Snape and Malfoy's criticism and gloating,  Harry accepts his position and goes forth with the Triwizard Tournament. As  Harry competes, he is drawn into a death trap and is unlikely to come out  the victor. With an explosive ending, the book climaxs in darkness and  readers are definetely going to scream for Book 5 soon. The book, in my  opinion surpasses that of the others due to better plot developement and  twists. New characters have been introduced as well as old ones returning.  The book also surprises people due to the fact that good doesn't always  triumph over evil.	2000-07-10

(Actual rating: 4.5 stars...see below) The sheer size of the book may be daunting at first look (600+ for the British and Canadian versions, 700+ for the US versions).  But that shouldn't stop most Potter fans from trying  to read it in one sitting!  If you're new to the series, this is not a  good book to begin with, as explanations for characters, motivations and  events that are key to the series are scattered throughout the text, and  the book will be much more appreciated (and understood!) if you are already  familiar with the series.<br />Rowling's writing has, I feel, improved as the  series has continued.  Her handling of the trials and problems of the  teenaged Harry and his friends is excellent, adding weight and meaning to  the action and the whimsy. Her writing style is just right for her  audience, but even adults will find places where her writing is quite  funny. Rowling's works have moved away from being just fantasy for the sake  of fantasy: the characters (main and supporting both) feel, grow and  change, existing in more than just a cardboard fantasy set. Her characters  are well fleshed out, realistically motivated, and are firmly placed in a  solidly-plotted and complicated world.  There is real-world relevance here  for the reader, an examination and confrontation of philosophical issues  such as good and evil, maturity, jealously, and friendship, and other(dare  we say it?) adult themes. The fact that these are essential problems in the  story set it apart from much lighter, escape-oriented fiction.<br />There are  some minor problems with the work, but nothing that will distract most  readers who get caught up in the action, the danger, and the sheer pleasure  of watching these characters interact in their imaginative world.<br />This  book is not exactly slow in starting, but it is long in starting (due to  the episode of the Quidditch World Cup, which is nearly a book in itself).  But the opening still leads well into the rest of the book, and becomes an  essential part of the narrative.  I rate this book 4.5 stars simply because  of the problem of the length of the pre-Hogwarts section of the book--it's  almost like reading a short story or novella inserted before the novel.  Readers who are used to the opening to the books so far(i.e. escape from  the Dursleys leading quickly to the train to Hogwarts) may find this a  difficult lump of text to get over.  Quidditch fans, of course, will love  it!<br />Having read Canadian versions of all the books, I am displeased by  the decision of the USA publishers to &quot;Americanize&quot; certain  terms--I believe that they are not giving children credit for their  intelligence in dealing with new terma and vocabulary.<br />This book contains  more of the same things that Harry Potter fans are looking for, along with  a slightly greater depth and sophistication that are a welcome addition to  the series.

It's just as magical and wonderful as the first books, and especially  brilliant and beguiling towards the end.  You won't read a better kids'  book for years!	2000-07-10

It's hard to to write a review without giving away some of thesome of the secret and part of the ending so if you haven't read thebook and you don't want it spoiled, don't read this review.<br />This book was very dark, much darker and scarier than any of the other three.  I would not recommend reading it to young children, especially before bed.  It put much more emphasis on Voldemort's old supporters, the Death Eaters, than ever before.  We find out who they were, with some surprises, and how some of them got out of going to Azkaban. Many find themselves in an awkward position when Voldemort is on the rise again.  The first chapter is entirely focused on Voldemort and Harry is not metioned at all.  Secondly, there were deaths in this book...  Through this book we come to better understand the situation before Voldemort's downfall, the terror, the chaos, and the uncertainty of not knowing who was on your side and who was really supporting the Dark Lord. <br />But despite, or perhaps because of that, this book is in my opinion the best in the series.  It is certainly the longest at 700+ pages.  There is lots of laughs, lots of andventure, and lots of hilarious attempts at romance.  Its not too mushy though, don't worry.  Its not all dark and scary though.  Harry goes to the Quiddich World Cup with the Weasleys, he and Ron have an interesting time finding dates for the Yule Ball, He Ron and Hermione have happy times hanging out in the common room, and there's plenty of comic relief provided by Fred and George Weasley.  There are lots of funny new characters too.  An extremely paranoid new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, an annoyingly nosy Daily Prophet reporter, students from the other two school for Wizardry in Europe-Beaubaxtons and Durmstrang, and a World Cup Quidditch player in love with Hermione. I laughed out loud many times while reading this book.<br />No book is perfect and though these are great I have a few problems. First of all does everybody havea secret they never tell Harry? It always seems that he, and we are always the last to know...All in all, this is a great book that everyone should definately read!  Buy it today!	2000-07-10

As Harry and his friends grow up, they begin more and more to see the dark side of their world and the dangers posed by those whose use of their powers is not  altogether pure. School jealousies, rivalries, and friendships begin to  take on new dimensions as these children take their first steps into  adulthood. I think that younger children may be somewhat bewildered by some  of the motivations that are whirling under the surface of these characters,  and by the new, darker cast of the plot (Voldemort's supporters are not  pleasant). But I couldn't put the book down, and that, in itself, is saying  something. These books simply get better and more complex with each new  installment.

(It is giving  nothing away to say that the plot of this book when added to the the story  arc of the planned seven-book series, reveals J.K. Rowling's master plan.)  If every hero needs a darkest hour (Luuuuuke. . . . I am your faaather),  this is it.<br />If you are one of the nervous milquetoasts who have already  expressed misgivings about Rowlings' suitability for children, this book  will only confirm your fears, as the plot is even darker and demanding of  more emotional maturity than the third installment of the series &quot;The  Prisoner of Azkaban.&quot; And this time, I can almost see your  point.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; mostly lives up to  the promise of the first three books. Rowling knows enough not to mess with  a winning formula so the plot follows the basic lines of the other--  encompassing one year at Hogwarts, starting and ending with Harry at the  Dursleys, etc. But this time there are so many extras and surprises both  pleasant and nasty that they sometimes threaten to overwhelm the forward  momentum of the plot. We finally find out about Neville Longbottom's  parents, other schools of magic, and a great many bits about the followers  of Voldemort (and really. . . if I need to explain any of this, you're in  the wrong place.) There's plenty of the old wonder and magic that the first  three books delivered so well, but these are met with a more complex  emotional landscape. This makes a certain amount of sense, as Harry is now,  what, fifteen years old?<br />Like Steven King, Rowling seems to be developing  a chronic need to over-write her novels. The good side of this is that she  opens up a plethora of great plot lines for development in the later books  (Wait 'til you find out about Hagrid! )<br />Personally, I feel that kids may  be exposed to almost anything if done with parental guidance, but some will  feel novel of this length and complexity might be pushing it.

Rowling does a great job of including crucial background from the series throughout the book to catch you up if you  haven't read all three of the other Potter volumes. Although I suspect  you'll want to do so the minute you finish this one -- they are addictive.  The series is great for many ages.

As a 30-something woman, I find that a lot of my friends raise their eyebrows skeptically when I mention Harry Potter.  &quot;Aren't those children's books?&quot;, they inevitably ask.  Well, yes, they are.  But  our Harry is growing up.  In this 4th book of her Harry Potter series,  Rowling has delved much deeper into the dark side of the wizard world.  The  reader can see Rowling stretching toward a full-fledged battle between the  forces of good (Potter) and evil (Voldemort).  There is a feeling of an  epic here, unlike her first three books which, although quite charming,  always left this reader feeling slightly as if she had just watched an  episode of Scooby Doo -- &quot;And I would have gotten away with it, too,  if not for those meddling kids!&quot;.  But there's none of that here, kids  might actually walk away from this one a little afraid.  Not only is there  the death of a major character in this particular book, but there is a lot  of death altogether.  Lord Voldemort is not a slightly cartoonish villian  anymore.  Oh no, he does grievous hurt....and a lot of it.  For the first  time, the readers get a sense of how large and sinister Voldemort's  following really is....and the true evil and weaknesses that really lie in  the hearts of men.  This book, almost 740 pages long, is Rowling's triumph  in this series so far.  Some of the more humorous characters show up  briefly, Peeves the Poltergeist, Nearly Headless Nick, Dobby the Elf....but  make no bones about it, Rowling's getting down to business. This is no  longer Harry's exploits in boarding school....this is war....and sometimes  war gets ugly.<br />I would recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans,  and to any would-be converts.  You haven't read Harry Potter until you've  read THIS Harry Potter.  Voldemort is on the move, Harry is growing up, the  battle is on....and this reader is buckling her seatbelt for Rowling's wild  ride.	2000-07-10

The only criticism I had of the first three books was that the dark characters that  provide Harry with his challenges were undeveloped caricatures, notably  Draco Malfoy and Lord Voldemort.  This volume takes great strides in  developing the villains. The series also continues to develop as great  mysteries.  The clues are fairly planted throughout the book and kids will  love the continued attention to detail.  I am an English teacher and aware  of the challenges against this series...and while this installment is  certainly darker, and will be sure to provide ammunition for those who  search desperatly for it, I still think it is a magical series that opens  the eyes of children to the joys of reading and the fun of fantasy  literature.	2000-07-10

However, the writing itself is of a quality that is  oft unseen in many books aimed at an older audience. Harry Potter and the  Goblet of Fire, the newest book in the series, reaches a pinnacle of  quality.<br />J. K. Rowlings outdid herself this time. The massive novel,  almost the length of the first three combined, has the development of  plotlines that were first seen in the first novel. Events forecast in the  previous novels reach a head, and envelop the reader as they change the  wizarding world as we know it. Many figures of authority are exposed as  corrupt, and those thought corrupt are shown to be truly on the side of  Harry, Dumbledore, and all those who would stand with them.<br />As a whole,  the series is good enough for any young person who might wish to read it.  However, as with many other media, the greatest fans of the series are  outside the target audience. Whether a teacher, who sees a child whom  they've had trouble teaching to read standing in line to buy, or someone  like myself, who sees the true value of the novels for someone older than  the target ten or eleven, these novels, Goblet of Fire especially, are a  fine example of modern fantasy. J. K. Rowlings deserves to be ranked among  such as Mercede Lackey, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and Melanie Rawn as the best  authors of modern fantasy, no matter the target audience. After all, it  hasn't stopped me from reading them yet!	2000-07-10

Harry, Ron, and Hermionie  all have become more 3 dimensional.  We see them attacking issues other  than the current problem on hand, and we begin to get a feel of what  they're thinking inside, and where they will be going.<br />One character that  could have been used more powerfully was Sirius.  Harry's new Godfather is  back, and there was an early attempt to get him deeply invovled in the  story.  But somehow, Sirius was not there when we needed him most.<br />I  would compare this book to Empire Strkes Back's place in the Starr Wars  trilogy, as this book moves a bit away from a simple feel good story, to  something setting the scenes for the coming books.<br />It was very  enjoyable reading the book.

Rowlings has said in interviews, the Harry Potter books are ultimately about the struggle of good vs. evil.  In this 4th book, the battle truly begins between these forces represented by Harry and Lord  Voldemort.  Over time, Voldemort has slowly gained strength and is now  poised to begin his dark fight for power once more.  Battle lines are drawn  and, in numerous plot twists, the author makes it truly difficult to know  whether a character is friend or foe.  This is a very exciting, but more  frightening and complex book than the others.  Emotions are strong and the  ultimate consequences of battling evil become evident to all.  Parts of  this book may be too frightening for young children.

Some people were worried about rumors flying  back and forth about the books continually growing darker. Some people were  worried that after all the waiting that it wouldn't live up to expectation,  but it was beyond expectation. It was brilliant, I laughed, I cried, I  loved it.<br />Unlike the other books in the series this one does not see  Harry to Hogwarts until after chapter 11. But those chapters before are by  no means, boring. In these chapters you can see why there were rumors of  the title being &quot;Harry Potter and the Quidditch World Cup&quot; or in  a slightly later chapter &quot;Harry Potter and the Doomspell  Tournament.&quot; They are there to set the stage for the greater plot,  which thickens with the turning of every page.<br />But the main plot of the  book might have something to do with the fact that Harry is now fourteen.  And when he was one, Voldemort tried to kill him. That was thirteen years  ago, but thirteen is an unlucky number.<br />The question now is: What are we  going to do waiting for Book five!	2000-07-10

She has taken her series to the next level. She  understands that most readers of her books are no longer just kids, but  people of all ages. I am a college student and was shocked at how much I  enjoyed this. It's as fast paced as any thriller and more imaginative than  any fantasy written today. The book starts with our intrepid hero Harry  ending another summer with those beastly Muggles also known as the  Dursleys. Then he is whisked away with by the Weasleys to the World Cup.  Its amazing that you are almost 200 pages in until he starts his fourth  year at Hogwarths, a school for wizards. The book takes awhile to propel  the main plot foward and parts are easy to predict (after all our hero must  always be in the center stage), but none of this matters.

I had read the 3  previous books, and was expecting a lot from this book, perhaps unfairly  so, and this book just didn't live up to what I was expecting.<br />First, I  might have an unfairly biased opinion seeing as how I am probably  &quot;outside&quot; the intended age of the readers of this book, but when  you find great literature such as Jk Rawlings has written, I don't think  there should be any age limit or bounds on who can read it.<br />Having said  that, I thought the first 3 books were magical, whimsical, and touched off  something in each of us that very few authors can do.  I think that this  4th book didn't quite capture that same feeling; it left me feeling as  though the author really pushed this book out; and struggledto meet a page  limit.<br />I wasn't exceptionally impressed, I think that the characters need  a breath of fresh air, and I think the book needs to break out of the mold  it is getting into.  The first 3 books &quot;worked&quot; very well, the  whole land and setting were new, and the concepts were new.  JK Rawlings  granted new characters and new things in each book, but I sort of think  that she needed something drastically new for this book, and she didn't do  it.<br />I got sort of tired reading this book; it needed more, alhtough it  was a lot longer than the last 3 books, I don't think it covered as much as  1 of the previous books.  I have the feeling that Rawlings was pushed to  make this book long, and that the story didn't come from her heart, but  rather from her mind.  She didn't appear to be writing to have fun; but  rather writing to meet a deadline.<br />I know the beginning of this review is  not very favorable for the book; but overall this book was a good book.  I  would definitely suggest buying it and reading it; you will still be amazed  and delighted by the scenery adn setting; the characters are teh same, and  the evil is eviller.<br />I just expected a little more from this author.ill be amazed  and delighted by the scenery adn setting; the characters are teh same, and  the evil is eviller.<br />I just expected a little more from this author.	2000-07-10

The Harry Potter series seems to get better with eachbook. This time Harry is faced with even darker magic, a wizardingtournament, and an unusual twist of events. It is sure to send a chill down your spine when Voldemort (the darkest wizard) returns and when Harry (growing older) is turned down by a girl when he asks her to the dance. It's everything in one: a drama, a comedy, a fantasy, and even a little of a romance. And all that is left to say is that Rowling has done it again: stirred our imaginations. Still, we hope (as if it were real) that Harry makes it through his next three years at Hogarts, hoping that J.K. Rowling can do it again.	2000-07-10

Although I had planned to read only a few chapters at a time to savor the experience, I  tore through the whole thing in two days.  This book cannot be put down for  long.  J.K.

The fourth book in the series is darker than the other  three as Harry matures and faces more and more of the Dark Arts, but Harry  and his friends remain determined and true throughout.  Some of it is a  little gruesome for younger readers, but it is balanced well against the  lessons of honesty, nobility, and courage that Harry Potter always has to  share.	2000-07-10

His parents were killed years before by He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named; his early years were a misery, being abused and derided by his mother's relatives;  but he found at the age of 11 that he was, in fact, a famous person in the  wonderful world of magic, and was invited to attend an school of magic  called Hogwarts. His first three years there are fully documented in the  first three books of this marvelous series.<br />But now Harry is growing up.  He is rapidly becoming a teenager, and the dangers of his world are  becoming serious as well. This new book in the series, while twice as long  as the previous books, never drags or seems drawn out. The exposition of  the previous books is done quickly and smoothly, without boring readers  already enscounced in Harry's world, the characters of Harry's best  friends, Ron and Hermoine, are more deeply developed, and the menace of  Harry's arch enemy, He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named, deepened into a real danger.  Both Harry's world and ours are led into a dark and chlling denouement that  will only leave readers begging for the next book! Maybe if we all work a  magic spell? Please hurry, Ms. Rowling!

At first, I had doubts that this was going to be as good as the first three, but I was wrong. J.K. Rowling has the same amusing humor and sharp turns everywhere. The same old characters are growing up like they should; Harry Potter won't stay eleven years forever. He's experiencing feelings  real teenagers feel, and so are Ron and Hermione. Ron's brothers, Fred and  George, add mischievous humor, as well as a little mystery. I thought the  new characters were very original and interacted well with the old  characters. J.K. Rowling has the reader suspecting everyone of everything.  The one difference I noticed between this fourth book and the first three  was the seriousness. It's darker and more tragic, which I think is a part  of Harry becoming older. This book has everything: horror, mystery,  fantasy, humor, a bit of teen romance, and touches on a lot of issues, like  prejudice.	2000-07-10

Although I was surprised by it's length (over 700 pages), the story was so engaging that I finished it within a day.<br />If you like the other Harry Potter books, I think you will like this  one, too.  There's a lot of the usual action (Quidditch, magical creatures,  sneaking around) though most of the story takes place outside the  classroom.  There were several plot twists that I did not see coming at all  - in fact I was floored by the bad guy's identity this time.<br />I  particulary liked that Harry is growing up and interacting more equally  with adults.  He has developed confidence and behaves less like a victim  with his enemies.  Maybe because of this, Harry sees the people around him  more clearly.  This book gives a lot of insight into the minor characters.  If you've ever wondered why Neville is being raised by his grandmother, why  Mr. Weasley doesn't make more money, why Hagrid is so tall, or why nobody  sticks up for the house elves - this book is for you.<br />One thing that  annoyed me was the explanation for pronouncing &quot;Hermione&quot;.  I  suppose the author was responding to numerous questions, but it seemed  contrived and did not flow well in the story.<br />Get ready for a fun read.  Make sure you have a large chunk of free time before you start this book,  though, because you will not want to put it down.	2000-07-10

I often wonder how this woman fabricated the entire, wonderful wizard world and continues to add such fascinating, charming, and  scary details. A few thoughts I had while devouring the book in 8 hours: 1)  Relationships between the three Hogwarts friends continue to develop. No  longer are Hermione and Ron static Harry sidekicks. They have agendas and  struggles of their own. I got to know Ron a lot better this time around. 2)  Although Harry is special, he is not invincible or infallible. This endears  more him to me, a hero with vulnerabilities. 3) Vol- er... He Who Must Not  Be Named is not the prostrate, weak character I once thought him to be. The  last 50 pages or so are truly terrifying. After finishing the last page, I  was horrified to see that I had chewed most of my nails off. A few tears  were shed too. But now I'm getting into spoiler territory, so I'll end by  saying that as Harry marks the days until the next school year begins, I'm  crossing them off until Book #5 arrives!	2000-07-10

Rowling does apurely magnificent job in this 4th installment of The Harry Potter series.  Where shall I began. Ah, the basis for any good novel, the plot! Rowling does not disappoint her audience by giving another well thought out story, full of mystery, horror, and the ocassional comedy. Rowling does what few Hollywood directors can do, and that is make the sequels better then the orginal. Every new Harry Potter book is better then the one which precedes it, making the series become more and more magical.  The Goblet Of Fire does not disappoint. Instead it surpasses anyones, and I repeat, anyones highest expectations.  This is a must read for children and adults alike. For children this novel opens up unlimited gateways of fantasy and adventure. For adults this novel, as every novel, opens up the inner child inside all adults, even people as &quot;Muggle-ish&quot; as Uncle Vernon.  Harry Potter And The Goblet of Fire is a sure fire hit, one that is being read quickly so that they may discuss it with friends, and will be re-read over and over again to see and analyze the foreshadowing of events to come.  Run, do not walk, to your closest book store and purchase this...masterpiece, this epic book. You will not be disappointed, and this I promise you. I myself must go......Alakazaam!	2000-07-10

I got my copy yesterday morning at  10:00 and finished all 734 pages this afternoon!  J.K. Rowling really  writes fantastic books... I like how she throws in details someone might  not pay attention to that actually play a big role in telling the story...  it makes it more interesting and makes you pay more attention. The way she  twists the plots around and her choice use of words are truly  &quot;magical&quot;! Ms. Rowling develops the characters so well you either  grow a strong liking or disliking towards them... it made me feel like I  was right there with them. I could feel Harry's loathing towards the  Slytherin house (especially Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape), and I could  feel Hermione's joy at accomplishing a pretty big goal at the end of the  story.  One of the most interesting parts of the book was meeting students  from other wizarding schools... I will not say much more for fear of  ruining the book, except that the last half of the book is very shocking  and quite unexpected...  if anyone has not read previous Harry Potter books  and wants to start with the most recent, I strongly advise against it.  You  MUST read them in numerical order to get the full experience... as I said  before, the author sprinkles littles details throughout all four of the  books that are necessary to tell the whole story. There is really only one  word to describe Harry Potter and his friends: unforgettable.	2000-07-10

The protagonist's adventures have a much  less trivial tone, as he is forced to confront issues far too difficult for  many juvenile readers to comprehend without assistance.  This is not,  however, detrimental to the series, as it appears to be taking a turn in a  more epic dimension which will be greatly appreciated by an older audience.  Rowlings demomstrates a much more polished technical skill, here, too,  employing a vocabulary that will seem in some places impossible to young  readers but beneficial to a complicated plot.  Rowling herself cannot help  poking fun at some of the attention her book has received, (i.e., an  annoying newsreporter named Rita Skeeter with a habit of twisting words to  suit her own purpose), but the effect is a book with many more dimensions  and fully formed characters.  In essence, this book appears to be a  watershed, for the series is now diverging from its original audience, and  hints at an even darker sequal.  My one complaint would be the rather slow  beginning, which seems to serve very little purpose in terms of the general  plot, save to fulfill the necessary Quiddich quota for the novel.	2000-07-10

I must say that I enjoyed having the book delivered to me first thing saturday morning.  I sat right down and started reading.  However, I was disapointed that J.K. Rowling felt the need to go into background detail on  what happened in the first three books.  If someone is buying this book, it  is very likely that they have already read the previous three, and know  them fairly well.  Therefore, reading a summary of the plot is unnecessary  and annoying.<br />But other than an occasional tendency to go into  summaries  and details of the first three books,  it is an interesting plot,  well-writen, and i wasn't able to put it down.  I started reading Saturday  at noon and kept going into Sunday morning.<br />It continues right where the  third left off, and has situations in it that would never have happened in  the first three.  As I was reading it, I noticed a word repeated that I  feel is inappropriate to put in a book geared towards children.  She uses  the word 'Damn' several times, both by Harry and his friends, and by Arthur  Weasley, the father of of one of his friends.<br />Other than those few  things, it is a remarkable book, and definitely worth reading.	2000-07-10

I happed to be down with the flu this weekend, enabling me to read the entire 700+ pages book already.  Being an adult, my fascination with the Harry Potter series is driven by pure  childish delight, a wonderful means of re-stimulating my imagination.  This  fourth installment, while enjoyable, was not in my opinion quite as magical  as the first three.  Much of the writing appears to be devoted toward  setting the stage for the final istallments rather than devoted toward the  adventure itself, almost overshadowing the plot of this specific book.  Additionally, I did not bond with any of the new characters introduced -  possibly because there were so many that they could not be presented as  fully and in depth as those in earlier books.<br />Despite these criticisms,  I did find it to be an enjoyable read, and am still happily looking forward  to the next installment.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was well worth the wait.  The book literally grips you from the very first page.  I got it at 12:01 on Saturday morning and didn't put it down until I finished it at 5:35 A.M.<br />Harry, Ron and Hermione are in their fourth year at Hogwarts.  Harry's  off to an exciting start to the year, as he attends the Quidditch World Cup  with the Weasley family.  Unfortunately for Harry, his fourth school year  is a year of problems.  The shadow of Lord Voldemort (the most powerful  evil wizard in the world) looms larger than ever.  Despite this, Harry  manages to live the life of a normal wizard teen.  Harry, Ron and Hermione  begin to notice the opposite sex.  The angst of trying to find someone to  take to the school dance is hilarious -- I literally laughed out loud.  Rowling handles this traditional rite of passage in a wonderful way.<br />The characterization in this book was excellent.  Even minor characters  are fleshed out well.  However, I must caution parents with small children  that the book is somewhat darker in tone than the rest of the series.  Four  people die in the course of the book.  None of the deaths are explicitly  shown, and there is no gratuitous violence, but younger children may be  frightened.  (The level of violence is comparable to that in C.S. Lewis'  Narnia series).<br />I hope all of you will enjoy this book as much as I have.  Happy reading -- and here's hoping the rest of the series is just as good,  if not better!	2000-07-10

J.K. Rowling left me hanging on to her every word from suspense.  Like the other three Harry Potter books Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a detailed mystery with a suprising ending. I would recomend this book to anyone  searching  for a magical adventure that will leave them waiting for more.  To anyone  who has read the other three books in the Harry Potter series, I believe  that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite so far.  Though I  will admit by far the longest!  To those who haven't read the Harry Potter  series, the books are similar to those written by Roald Dahl and Eva  Ibbatson. Also, I would suggest reading the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Harry Potter  book before reading the fourth.  This would make Harry Potter and the  Goblet of Fire seem less confusing.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  Begins with Harry (a young wizard)spending his summer holiday with the  Dursleys (his aunt, uncle, and cousin).  But soon he is off to his friend  Ron's house for a special treat.  Soon Hary and Ron are off to there  magical school (Hogwarts)to find a huge suprise for them and the other  students.  As the school year rolls allong Harry  meets up with many things  such as,a Goblet of Fire, a reporter that really bugs them, 3 important  tasks, a complete disaster, and maybe even a duel. I really enjoyed these  events. I LOVED Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!	2000-07-10

It shows the steady, measured maturation of the characters that fans of the series have been promised since the beginning, along with the usual fun, suspense and humor.<br />Even the death in this book, which author Rowling  seemed to believe was necessary to fully establish the evil nature of her  villain, Voldemort, was handled perfectly.  With sadness tempered by fury  and determination on the parts of all the heroes.<br />Rowling also shows us  some marvelous new glimpses of Harry's world, taking her carefully laid  foundation and adding to it.  We see not only Non-British wizards and  witches, but even Non-European.  One might wonder how other countries will  respond to the continued threat of Voldemort.<br />This is one of the first  books I've been looking forward to in a great while that hasn't  disappointed me in the slightest.  I finished the book in 7 hours straight,  and then went back to reread my favorite parts.  It is a masterwork, not of  children's literature, but of literature.  With this book, JK Rowling  establishes herself as not just a great storyteller, but a great writer.	2000-07-10

This book was very dark, much darker and scarier than any of the other  three.  I would not recommend reading it to young children, especially  before bed.  It put much more emphasis on Voldemort's old supporters, the  Death Eaters, than ever before.  We find out who they were, with some  surprises, and how some of them got out of going to Azkaban.  Many find  themselves in an awkward position when Voldemort is on the rise again.  The  first chapter is entirely focused on Voldemort and Harry is not metioned at  all.  Secondly, there were deaths in this book, one which is a student at  Hogwarts.  Through this book we come to better understand the situation  before Voldemort's downfall, the terror, the chaos, and the uncertainty of  not knowing who was on your side and who was really supporting the Dark  Lord.<br />But despite, or perhaps because of that, this book is in my  opinion the best in the series.  It is certainly the longest at 700+ pages.  There is lots of laughs, lots of andventure, and lots of hilarious  attempts at romance.  Its not too mushy though, don't worry.  Its not all  dark and scary though.  Harry goes to the Quiddich World Cup with the  Weasleys, he and Ron have an interesting time finding dates for the Yule  Ball, He Ron and Hermione have happy times hanging out in the common room,  and there's plenty of comic relief provided by Fred and George Weasley.  There are lots of funny new characters too.  An extremely paranoid new  Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, an annoyingly nosy Daily Prophet  reporter, students from the other two school for Wizardry in  Europe-Beaubaxtons and Durmstrang, and a World Cup Quidditch player in love  with Hermione. I laughed out loud many times while reading this book.<br />No  book is perfect and though these are great I have a few problems.  First of  all does everybody have a secret they never tell Harry? It always seems  that he, and we are always the last to know.  Why does Harry get  everything?  In this book he gets to be the second champion from Hogwarts  and compete in the Triwizard Tournement.  He wins everything and sometimes  I just want him to lose for a change.  For this reason I was actually  rooting partialy for Cedric Diggory in the tournement.  What is up with  Viktor Krum suddenly being in love with Hermione.  I don't understand it.  Nothing against Hermione but she isn't breathlessly gorgeous.  Viktor Krum  is about eighteen, and she is fourteen, thats kind of sick.  Then on top of  that, Cedric Diggory is in love with Cho Chang who is also much younger  than his is.

From the moment I picked it up, I couldn't stop reading it. As is now the trademark of Harry Potter books, The Goblet of Fire is full of twists and turns. And like the rest of the books, clues are given  slowly througthout until the end when all is revealed. Usually this is fine  by me, but this book was gigantic! 700+ pages is not something you want to  try to read in one sitting even though there is always this urge to read  just to the next chapter to learn more of the intriguing story. Other than  the hefty length of the book, which might be unsuitable for younger  readers, The Goblet of Fire is magnificent. All I'll say is that it's about  time that Harry started acting like he was going through puberty. Also,  there were so many moments when I felt like screaming &quot;Go Harry!&quot;  (end of chp.16) or when a tear would come to my eye (Hagrid and Maxime). So  if you're a Harry Potter fan (who isn't these days?) get this book now! And  if you aren't, well... get it anyway! The Goblet of Fire blows the other  three away.	2000-07-10

The way the book starts out tells the reader why Harry gets the splitting head pains in his scar is different from when it usually  starts out in his aunts and uncles house, which makes it more interesting.  One of the other events that happen is when Harry's name is chosen by the  Goblet of Fire, and asks the question of how he got by the age line. The  next thing thing that is neat about the book is when the spirits of the  people who Voldermort killed comes out of Voldermort's wand causing a  sheild to block Harry from Voldermort.  Another thing that I found  interesting is how so many people, including me, thought that someone else  was going to be killed and never gave thought to the person who was killed.

This may be hard to believe, but J.K. Rowling has outdone herself!<br />One of the great joys of the Harry Potter series is that Rowling has created a world that is fully realized and has its own magical logic.  By taking  Harry and his friends beyond Hogwarts's gates, by introducing them to  wizards from other countries, Rowling has a whole new playground in which  to experiment.<br />Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts offers him an opportunity  to meet incredible new challenges and learn a ton of new magic skills.  While the first three HP volumes were exciting and full of adventure, this  fourth volume is truly thrilling!  As Harry faces these new and at times,  very scary, challenges, he learns more about the history of Lord Voldemort  and the bad old days when Voldemort was at the height of his powers.<br />In  addition, Harry and his pals are growing up and on one occasion must attend  an event with a formal date -- heavens, that's a challenge right there!  What will they do?  Through it all, they come to understand each other  even better and the bonds of their friendships strengthen.  Harry faces a  tremendous challenge at the end of the book and we come to fully realize  the brilliance and compassion of Professor Dumbledore. As always, Rowling  skillfully weaves in a strong sense of fair play and tolerance for others  throughout this complex and plot twisting tale.<br />If you enjoyed the first  3 volumes, then hang onto your hat -- this is the best of the bunch!  I  read the first 3 books myself, and then aloud to my niece and nephew -- and  I can honestly say that HP and The Goblet of Fire is better than the other  three combined!  BRAVO J.K.

If  the very youngest Potter addicts find their attention flagging before they get to the end, they may just  have to grow into this tale.  Harry and his friends add puppy love and  political activism to their usual preoccupations as they experience another  year of magic and mayhem at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  As promised death takes place on stage, but  as Harry grows older and more  self reliant, the atmosphere seems less nightmarish despite the more  aggressive villainy.  Rowling's sense of humor gets full play as well.  At one point, as the non-magical Dursley family tries to cope with the  wizarding  Weasleys who have not quite managed to materialize in their  living room, I had to put the book down and finish laughing.  I am  really enjoying this series and I can't wait to find out what happens next.	2000-07-10

In junior high I was reading Steinbeck, Austen, and Dickens quite  easily. Reading has always been fun for me. However, though I have been  reading advanced material for ages now, I simply can't get over how GOOD  these Harry Potter books are! They seem to get better with each new  release, and &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is no  exception. As alwasy, &quot;...the Goblet...&quot; leaves us yearning for  more. I already await the release of Harry Potter book #5. Everyone should  read these books; adults and children alike, and all the ages in between as  well. J.K. Rowling is a genius, and her Harry Potter books deserve a spot  on the shelf with such other timeless classic fantasies as C.S. Lewis'  &quot;Chronicles...&quot;, and J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and  &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; triology. Rowling's Harry Potter books are  inspiration to those who have always dreamed of success in the writing  world, as well as simply pure fun to those who just want to read.	2000-07-10

Although I am not done reading &quot;Harry Potter and theGoblet of Fire,&quot; almost everyone can appreciate this book. It hasgreat storywriting produced by, the now legendary, J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter is starting his fourth year at Hogwarts Wizarding School, and is maturing gradually. Harry is also going to the Internation Quidditch Cup with his dear friend, Ron and Hermione. It seems that J.K. Rowling is trying to also mature the book, not just Harry and company. There is more constant swearing like the occasional &quot;damn&quot; or &quot;hell.&quot; Nothing too big to worry about, but parents with very young children to take notice of this. Along with swearing, the Harry Potter series seems to be taking a lot more time divulging into the Dark Arts. J.K. Rowling has introduced us to many new people that we only know very little of (Charlie &amp; Bill Wealsey, for example), and she does it with grace. The character development is flawless. &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is definitely the best and obviously longest of all the Harry Potter books.  Definitely worth going to the book store for.	2000-07-10

Although vividly named candy and Quidditch still hold his attention, other more adult concerns are looming. At first the book seems loose, the Quidditch World Cup an almost perfunctory chapter notable only for its aftermath. Ms Rowling seems also  to be taking aim at some obvious targets and the prospect of a politically  correct Harry Potter looms. Luckily the chronicles of Harry (and the  imagination of Ms Rowling) are as inventive as ever, with every obvious  target missed and a storyline that reaches a wonderful, if brooding,  finale. This book ends with threats not only to Harry but the entire world  he inhabits, we can only hope that the next year will be enough for him and  his readers to prepare.	2000-07-10

Some will suggest that the key ingredients are things like having a certain  amount of plot, an interesting gameplay, believable characters, writing  that is easy to comprehend, an unpredictable roller coaster of mystery, or  an entertaining witty humor.<br />Yet while great movies/games/books (or any  other forms of such media) will tend to have as many of these key  ingredients as possible, it isn't *any* of these that make them stand above  the rest.  And while a combination of many of these factors marks to rare  or uncommon talent, great work is definitely more than the sum of the  parts.<br />The Harry Potter series is something quite special.  When you read  it, you know it isn't just the characters, setting, and atmosphere that are  magical.  It is the *story* that takes all of those key characteristics  (characters with frighteningly realistic depth of personality and  believable motivations, a sophisticated yet followable plotline, a setting  so picturesque it could have been painted on a canvas, delightful humor...)  and crafts them into a very deliberately designed experience.  Throughout  the series, it is very clear to the reader that Rowling knew exactly what  she was doing and exactly how she wanted them to feel.<br />While the first  three books tended to beckon the reader's feelings to the desired effect,  The Goblet of Fire thrusts the reader through subtle combinations of  stronger and more mature emotions that Rowling describes in bright hues of  vivid detail.  The fourth book has a nittier grittier feel throughout that  reminds you the characters are growing up slowly but surely.  You open this  book almost twice the size of the others expecting a heavierread.  You  come away in the end almost feeling a heavier burden on your soul.  Whether  you are currently around Harry's age or reminiscing about when you were,  you know how he feels throughout even the thickest of his ordeals.<br />And  for those who ever wonder just what the big fuss is about, this is one of  the better series where it is &quot;worth the time to find out&quot;...	2000-07-10

Like in the other books, we see how important it is that we have our  friends believe in us and we believe in them.

I always chuckle when I see the &quot;reading level&quot; listed for the Harry Potter series. I am almost 40, and was as anxious as any of Rowling's younger fans for the publication of this installment in the Harry Potter  line. As with the three previous books, Ms. Rowling has written an engaging  story with exquisite characterization, and no speaking-down to her juvenile  audience. We get a more indepth look at many of the Weasleys, adding color  and texture to this wonderful family. Indeed, we see additional sides to  several old favorite (and not so favorite) characters. I will not include  much in the way of details, except to note that as Ms. Rowling warned, this  book is considerably darker than the previous three. Younger readers are  warned that they may not wish to use this book as their bedtime reading.  However, everyone should read it.  Not surprisingly, it would be best to  read all the books in the series, in order. More so than the previous ones,  &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; takes for granted the reader's knowledge of  what has occurred in the previous 3 years at Hogwarts. P.s.

Harry Potter IV is the best book i have read this summer. I have read all the other Harry Potter books and this one is my favorite. Not only is there a little bit of romamce and jealousy, there is also adventure!  The way  the characters and places are described you feel you are actually there  standing along with Harry. There is more danger in this book. Harry must  face his fears and find courage in himself if he wants to survive.	2000-07-10

Well, considering that the novel is an astounding 700+ pages long (compared to  the 300+ of the previous novels), it is pretty strange. I'm currently a  high school student studying English for my summer school assignment, and  gained a love for Harry Potter after reading the Sorcerer's Stone about a  year ago. After being slightly dissappointed with book 2 and 3 (They  weren't quite as good as book 1), I eagerly awaited book 4, hoping Rowling  would come back with some Hogwarts magic. Happily, I was not dissappointed.  Harry Potter 4 is right up there in literary quality as book 1. The story  this time is a lot more compelling, and keeps the reader glued to the  pages, just burning inside for more. With the addition of some brand new  characters and some story twists (which I'm not gonna say), this book is  truly one to read. I started reading Saturday morning, and just finished  Sunday night. I can say that this book has one of the most incredible  endings also. With the extra pages, Rowling has weaved a masterpiece of  fantasy fiction, and if any new reader of Harry Potter decides to read this  one first (Which is not that great of an idea...read book 1 first!), they  will be overwhelmed by how good this is. Believe the hype! Harry Potter is  not just a fad, it's truly one of the greatest fantasy series written.  Rowling, I believe, can be compared to Jacques in the quality of her  fantasy world. I cannot wait for Harry Potter 5	2000-07-10

This is the best one yet.  Harry is growing, and his view on the world reflects this.  Quidditch is great as always, but this one is both darker and meatier.  The kids discover the opposite sex, or at least try to.<br />Since Harry is 14 instead of 11, his smart alec comments come more from  a position of power.  He is becoming one of the greatest boy characters  since Huckleberry Finn.  He is real, he fights with his friends, he has  dreams of granduer and a great heart.<br />I laughed all through the book,  but the funny parts felt more like comic relief than the central purpose.  The ending is not as high and warm and fuzzy but more of a somber  preparing-for-the-storm.<br />More great characters, lots of loose ends and  Dumbledore is simply one of the greatest adults around.  Dudley also gets  some payback for the years of torture towards Harry.  This one is just  wonderful!	2000-07-10

However, it's definitely darker than the other three books. The danger in the other books was more light-hearted, whereas an innocent character dies in this book, (as well as a lot of other deaths) and there is much more Dark Magic at play. Rowling seems to be stretching things a bit with the introduction of new creatures such as Veela (which are not fully explained), revealing that Hagrid is a half-Giant, and the introduction of the Death Eaters as followers of Voldemort. (Why didn't anyone call them Death Eaters in the previous three books?) The addition of Harry Potter into the Triwizard Tournament also seems a bit forced, although obviously necessary for the plot, and Harry never seems to be as interested in performing the necessary tasks as he should be. However, there is some very interesting character development now that Harry, Ron and Hermione are older and starting to notice their hormones, which makes some of the chemistry and tension between the three of them more intriguing. As well, Rowlings continues to maintain a good sense of humor regarding the misunderstandings between the wizard world and the Muggle world (Molly Weasley sends a letter to the Dursleys inviting Harry to stay for the Quidditch World Cup and covers the envelope with stamps, not sure if she's got enough; none of the wizards understand that 'bugging' means to secretly record conversations). Overall, an excellent must-read, although possibly this book may not be as suitable for younger readers as the other books were.	2000-07-10

It is official . . . with the release of the fourth of seven books that make up this mystifying Epic, J.K. Rowling has established herself as arguably the most spectacular creative writer working today.  For the  fourth time, Rowling has composed a plot of such impermeable solidity that  one cannot help but to become spellbound with awe at her unquestionable  literary genius.  In this novel, Harry Potter shows definite signs of  acquiring much mental, physical, and magical maturity.  Along with help  from his good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns  invaluable lessons pertaining to stealing golden eggs from deadly  Horn-tailed dragons, battling evil wizards who want to kill him, and, yes,  Harry even begins to notice what was once to him an elusive species of  magical animal: Girls! And maturity is what Harry desperately needs, for  his antipode of power--the all-evil Lord Voldemort--finds a way to come  back to power.  But not only has You-Know-Who found a way to attain rebirth  through a rite of horrible wickedness; He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has, too,  found a way to overcome his one weakness . . . no longer does the Power of  Love, which Harry's mother bestowed upon her son with her fatal sacrifice,  protect Harry from Voldemort.  Therefore, Voldemort is back, and he is even  more horrible than he has ever been.  Hold on to your broomsticks, Potter  fans!  For this is the pivotal Potter book that will leave readers sitting  on the edge of their Firebolts desperately awaiting the next Hogwarts  school year in which the protectors of what is Good hope to unite so to  thwart Voldemort and his Death Eaters' potential reign of destruction.	2000-07-10

This book certainly changes the way I look at Harry Potter.  Not only because of the hormone stuff and the crushes, but because of that, this book is so in a different point of view.  Everything is so loosely put, but is is a great book.  The plot really is in this book, like JK Rowling says.  The Triwizard Tournament is very significant because Quiddich matches are  cancled because of it.  Now that's a major change.  And the people from  other schools also have a very significant effect on the people at  Hogwarts. The end of the book is not remotely frightening, but very good.  I won't give the ending away for you but lets just say that this book  really leaves you hanging.  Not that much, but the way she puts it is like  something horrible is happening and you won't know what it is until a year  later. Harry definetly gets smarter in this book.  You can tell.  Also, one  of the things that gets me confused is who everyone likes in the end of the  book except someone.  It's very confusing. Now, the person that dies I'm  not telling you, but I personally don't care about who it was at all.  I  mean, that person barely is an important character for heaven's sake!  It's  kinda sad, but I'll get over it in 5 seconds. There are a LOT of  revelations in this book.  It may not surprise you, but it is a revelation.  Also one about Fudge's err, TRUE character. But overall, this is a good  book, I would say my second favorite overall.  The prisoner of Azkaban was  better.  But I do recommend it, very much. This year's defense against the  dark arts teacher is so- distant and yet plays a VERY important role in the  end, so watch out!	2000-07-10

The factor that makes these dark parts of the book ( including very a vivid description of Voldemort , still  have flashbacks!) is Ms. Rowlings extraordinary talent of taking you INTO  the book making your imagination soar as though every word is actually said  and everything is happening right then and there. You find yourself  laughing with the characters and crying at their misfortunes ( especially  Harry's) I'm sure JKR was trying to be realistic showing children that  there is a dark side to everything, but took it a little far for a  children's book. There is a point in the book where Voldemort tortures a  wizard by letting him lay on the ground with no pity while his blood is  leaving him through a chopped off body part. Being older I could tell  myself it is only a book , but could children of a younger age? I would  definitely consider this before buying this book to a child.	2000-07-10

It was well written and I could not put it down.  I liked how you never knew who the bad guy was.  I even felt nervous when Harry was in trouble- I  was scared for him.  I felt that J. K.  Rowling had the book planned out,  she did not just think of the story as she went along.  she knew what she  was going to write, and even gave hints to what was going to happen.  She  kept on talking about what had happened in previous Harry Potter books, so  I recommmend skimming through the other books so you will understand.  Harry Potter is able to go to the Quidditch Cup with Hermione and Ron!  He  even gets to see Krim, the seeker for the Bulgarian team!  Harry is in his  fourth year at Hogwarts, and being his usual self, gets in trouble.  He  makes friends with the new Dark Arts teacher, who used to be an Auror, or a  dark wiozard catcher!  In this book, Harry makes new friends, and  unfortunately almost loses some.  Malfoy is as bad as always, and is making  this year hard. In this book, Harry faces new and exicting chalenges.  I  really enjoyed this book, and recommend it to everyone.	2000-07-10

This is nothing short of wildly  inaccurate.  &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is indeed over seven hundred pages  long, but it never drags or loses either its intensity or sense of fun.  I  for one had finished it within twenty-four hours having purchased it, and  the only slow moments I experienced were when I was forcibly kept away from  reading it.  Rumors of both romance and death were way overblown, and no  nine-year-old boy need worry that Harry is going to be tainting himself  with a girlfriend any time soon. :-) The focus remains exactly where it  should, on the building  mystery and suspense raised at the beginning of  the book, with plenty of forays into the Hogwarts experience for laughs.  &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is indeed somewhat darker than any of the  previous three, but it's nothing that a ten-year-old won't be able to  handle.  I found it delightfully creepy, and even the most dire scenes at  the climax of the book still remained more fun, albeit in a creepy sort of  way, than frightening.  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is  a more-than-worthy successor to the first three in the series, easily as  funny, smart, and exciting as its predecessors.	2000-07-10

This is by far the best book in the Harry Potter series. What a ride!

As soon as I read the chapter on the goblet of fire (chapter  16) I new I wasn't going to be able to set it down.

Now maybe there will be a little  less pretense and politics and a little more action in the Ministry.

Rowling has hit the mark again with her latest book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  It has all of the twists and turns of all of the previous 3 installments of the the Harry Potter saga and then some.  The  book is quite long but full of detail.  Readers will enjoy the kind of  conflict and resolution (or maybe continued conflict) that everyone  experiences with their relationships and friendships.  We once again learn  some facinating tidbits about Harry and his friends, and are left with some  tantalizing clues about the direction of the next book in the series. This  book is much more emotional in character; Harry has a crush on a girl at  school and one of his friends dies (no, you won't find out which one from  me).  The lines between good and bad are also slowly becoming more clear,  which will lead to a pivitol confrontation in a future installment.  I  like this well written series as it is a great 'read'.  I read professional  manuals on a daily basis and want an exciting, well written story for my  'time off'.

I looked forward as much as anyone else in the world (approx. 1.5 million people) to the latest installment in Harry Potter's adventures--prepared, as an adult and a connoiseur of children's books, to find that the 4th book  wouldn't be as exciting or breath-taking as the first three, and especially  the 3rd.  Was I wrong!  From the first chapter of Harry Potter and the  Goblet of Fire, JK Rowling proves  that she is nothing short of excellent.  The book is full of great humor, the complexities of friendship, amazing  magic, and keep-you-up-at-night action and suspense. The Quidditch World  Cup is only the beginning.  Who could have thought that anything could be  more exciting than Quidditch?  But there is--and the goblet of fire is just  the starting point.  JK Rowling also pulls no punches.  She has previously  said that she wanted to prove once and for all the evil that Voldemort is  with this book, and she does so with events so horrific that parents of  younger fans may need to guide their kids through the book.  But I am  grateful that she doesn't pull punches. Details and events from the first  three books are woven brilliantly together.  Harry's world definitely  became even more real, and he, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore and other  characters we've come to love do as well, and readers will be drawn with  their full empathy into wizard life.  The mania surrounding Harry Potter  isn't simple marketing hype--it's the genuine enthusiasm of readers who  have fallen in love with a very believable world and with very believable  people.  Now, I just don't know how long I can wait for book 5...the Goblet  of Fire left me anxious, thrilled, but 100% satisfied.	2000-07-09

From page one of The Goblet of Fire to page 734  this is a winner.  The story begins with exciting events which tell us that  Harry is indeed going to meet new challenges which will require both  personal courage and the support of his school friends and the adult  wizards from Hogwarts. Activities which any school may include (such as the  Yule Ball) let us see that even though the students may be learning much  about wizardry they still have the same uncertainities as Muggle boys and  girls.  The three tasks are real page turners and the reader is never sure  how each will be concluded.  The final chapter, &quot;The Beginning&quot;,  gives us a glimpse of the personal growth that Harry and his friends have  made over the year. Loyalty, fair play, learning to accept others for what  they are rather than their appearance or achievements are  things we all  need to act upon. No matter our age, we can learn something from Harry  Potter.	2000-07-09

But like the others in the series, &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; is not primarily a  book about witchcraft, except for its delightfully peculiar setting. It is  a book about life, and how it can be at turns both exhilerating,  satisfying, terrifying, confusing or sad. It is also a book about choices,  friendship, loyalty and great personal courage. The popularity of this  series is testimony to the great longing of today's children to make sense  of the things that happen to them in life. J.K. Rowling joins the ranks of  C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and Susan Cooper in reworking the deep myths of  traditional folklore to meet this search for meaning and to help readers  sort out the critical issues of good and evil that confront them at every  age of life.	2000-07-09

Harry was awesome at age eleven, and he will continue to be awesome through-out his lovely, well written, ficticious life.  I wouldn't mind being a wizard/witch.  Out of all of the 4 books J.K. Rowling has written so far, none of them, can you consider as your favorite.  They all capture  your heart within the first 3 pages at the most.  However, I can admit that  even though I have no favorite (since all are so amazing! )  I KNOW that  the 4th one IS THE BEST!  The plot and all of Harry's adventures  certainly blow away your mind.  I would consider J.K. Rowling's Harry  Potter books the 8th World Wonder!  I have not read any decently long book  (752 pg. for #4) by any author (with the exception of Ms. Rowling) that was  remotely interesting.  However, Harry Potter #4 is not remotely  interesting.  It is so extraordinary, I cannot express my enjoyment of the  book with words.  But if you want to read something where somebody can  &quot;conjure&quot; words that flow gracefully on the pages, READ HARRY  POTTER!  The characters are so real, in fact the whole book seems so  real, you feel as if you have just finished reading a non-fiction  assignment for history.  Now, history is your favorite subject in school.  The only bad thing about Harry Potter is that this amazing book series  unfortunately ends at book seven.  I think that now is the time I should  end this describing of the AWESOME 4th book.  I fear I may blow your mind  by more descriptions for the cause of it's awesomeness.  So, READ  &quot;HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE! &quot; and discover secrets so  juicy, so sweet, so surprising, you'll want gobble it in a second and ask  for  &quot;1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000ths&quot;.	2000-07-09

With all the buildup and hype and so forth for the release of the 4th installment in the Harry Potter series I dreaded that the book wouldn't measure up, that all the excitement would be for  nothing.

In this book, Harry  sees the Quidditch World Cup, discovers girls, is entered in a sort of  spell duel, meets some new friends and foes, becomes farther and then  closer to his friend Ron, and once again has a brush with, well,  You-Know-Who.... but I won't give it all away.

It is Rowling's longest work yet, but the plot stays strong for  all 735 pages.  I especially enjoyed that she broke away from the standard  practice of reexplaining the characters, locations, and plot points from  previous novels at the very beginning of the book.  Instead, she has them  unfold over the course of the novel, which recaptures that sense of  discovery that readers will recall from the first few books.  Rowling  writes the story in such a way that those who have not read the first three  books will be able to follow the plot, yet HP veterans will not be bored by  a &quot;recap&quot; chapter.  The length of the novel demands new  characters be added, but is also allows the development of some of the more  minor character from previous books, such as Arthur Weasley and the  teaching staff, to take on a more prominent role.  The book provides a  deeper glimpse into the power structure of the Wizarding world, and Rowling  focuses on the trails of being an adolescent trying to deal with  friendship, jealousy, and adult expectations.  Another benefit of the  longer book is that the subplots of this book are more thoroughly  developed.  Hermione, Ron, and Neville are explored at greater length, and  the students' are faced with some challenges to their preconceived notions  of what makes a life valuable.  There is a lot going on in the book:  new locations and names, fascinating spells and charms, and unexpected plot  developments.  The bottom line is that HP fans will be delighted with the  developments, shocked by the revelations, and intrigued to read what  happens as he enters his fifth year.  Let's hope Rowling doesn't make us  wait too long.	2000-07-09

Each book in the series  develops the characters more fully, and the plots increase in complexity.  The fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, achieves more complex  characterizations of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Draco  Malfoy, and, of course, He Who Must Not Be Named.  The tone darkens  somewhat, and the evil ones begin to threaten more forcefully.  As did  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this novel contains several  sinister adults.  These evil ones continue to present Harry with  increasingly complicated tasks and challenges.  A sense of mystery pervades  the book. Can Harry continue to prevail over Voldemort?  Why does he have  to spend every summer with the Dursleys?  What does Dumbledore see as good  in Snape and Hagrid?  Will Harry develop romantic interests in young  witches at Hogwarts?  Just as Rowling had promised,  these issues are  addressed in this book, and many important questions are answered.  This  terrific author  spins this fourth tale skillfully, including the  delightful details that are characteristic of her wonderful style in the  first three novels.  Without a doubt, this book will please readers of  all ages.  The elements of a fantastic tale reside within the 734 pages of  this novel, and no reader will be disappointed in what Rowling  has crafted  in this book.

Also, I would suggest parents think of this book not as &quot;too long&quot; but as a good value... there's an awful lot of book to keep your children occupied for a long time.<br />As rumoured, there is a death in this book, but it is handled well, and is something the children should be prepared to deal with.<br />If anything, anticipation for the next book is heightened even more with this book... watch for Harry Potter mania to grow, not diminish.	2000-07-09

This new book is full of strong emotions, this book doesn't seem to contain the sureness that everything is going to  be all right and Harry is going to come out on top.  After I read the book,  I felt just like Harry: depressed. The romance in the book kinda confused  me and threw me off the plot, it wasn't like I expected at all.

From the moment you open this book you are swept into a magical world of wizards, dragons and magic. The fourth book in this series, The Goblet Of Fire is the best. One reads about the adventures of a fourteen year old  wizard-in-training, Harry Potter. Accompanied by his two close friends, Ron  and Hermoine, Harry must learn to use his magic as well as fight against  Dark wizards who are out to kill him.

Everyone anxiously awaited The Empire Strikes Back, but as the bad guys seemed more powerful and kept the  heroes on the run throughout, many fans were disappointed. THE GOBLET OF  FIRE is very similar, as Lord Voldemort returns to power and keeps all our  heroes struggling to keep up with him.<br />THE GOBLET OF FIRE, as promised by  J. K. Rowling, is a much darker story than the first 3 books. There's lots  of action throughout, as we follow Harry to the World Quidditch Cup in  August and then to Hogwarts for the school year and the first Triwizard  Tournament in ages. Due to the high death toll in previous tournaments,  they had been discontinued, so everyone is a bit apprehensive. Students  from 2 other wizardry schools in Europe have been invited to participate,  and only the most senior students (17 years old) may enter their names into  the Goblet of Fire. The Goblet selects one student from each of the 3  schools as entrants, so imagine everyone's surprise when a  4th person is  selected--Harry! But who placed his name in the Goblet of Fire? Danger  abounds in every tournament event.<br />We see our old friends and meet many  new characters. As always, the people in Harry's world are well drawn and  very interesting. I would have liked to see more day-to-day life at  Hogwarts, as that has always been the most fun for me. In spite of running  over the entire year, we see very little of classes as the book  concentrates more on the tournament. The book ends after the tournament is  over, but don't expect a nice resolution to the story. The characters are  busy planning avenues of attack against Lord Voldemort, which sets things  up for Book 5. Be sure to read these books in order, as each builds on the  previous.	2000-07-09

This book is typical of the other Harry Potter episodes I've read. Although, I am beginning to realize something about them.  I have to say the Goblet of Fire is well written, I couldn't put it down... But this  doesn't shone out a few facts.<br /> These books by JK Rowling, are  depicting scenarious of using magic, spells, incantations and the like, and  turning them into seeming like it is fun, or some sort of game. I've been  open to actual practices of the like, and I can tell you it is no game, in  fact it is quite dangerous. And JK Rowling is poisoning young minds into  believing it is something good. No matter how the magic may help Harry  Potter, what kind of morals are you wanting your children to learn, when  they begin thinking can get anything they want through magic? There are  better ways of excersizing a child's imagination.<br /> I won't discredit  JK Rowling for her gift for writing... she has made interesting adventures,  I enjoy reading them.  I feel it is only safe for one to read as long as  one is aware of the truth inbetween the lines of text. This is not  something I'd want my little brothers and sister reading without first  learning about the truth of magic.<br />As for the plot/storyline of the  Goblet of Fire, I rank it a 4, for being well written.  But I think book 2  and 3 were slightly better. To each their own.	2000-07-09

I won't ruin the other  surprises for those who haven't finished it yet.<br />I will say that I am  sooo amazed that Rowling (and her readers) can keep track of such a  complicated story. Each book gets a little darker, adds more characters,  has more threads to tie together. But the characters also become more  three-dimensional, the danger a little more real.

Surprise, surprise: The latest  Harry Potter adventure is twice the size and twice as good as the last.  Unlike some writers of ever-expanding sequels to popular best-sellers, Ms.  Rowling mapped out her plan for seven books before writing even one of  them: a classic, winning literary strategy.  The books do not get thinner,  in every sense of the word, but deeper.  The point of view, also, matures  with Harry and the writing becomes more complex. The books are not so much  a series as a set, as we see in trilogies or quartets, each bringing us  something more, each rounding out the story more.[STOP]  As an  educator, the value I see in these books is that they are engaging, written  in the old oral story-teller style in which each episode, or chapter, ends  with a question, leaving the reader to anticipate the next.  It is also,  literally, &quot;a page turner,&quot; as the pages also are set up to leave  us anticipating the next.  However, &quot;engaging&quot; alone is not  enough.  Students have the pleasure of discovering for themselves how a  book can capture their imaginations and transport them to another place,  peopled with characters in settings and situations described by the author  and fleshed out, or given life, by the reader.  Moreover, we have in these  books an excellent use of the written language, in terms of the academic  conventions of structure and punctuation as well as in the use of  interesting vocabulary -- a good model all around. [STOP]  Teachers:  don't rob your students of the opportunity to discover the pleasure of  reading, of the printed word, for themselves by reading this aloud to them.  (You'll also be able to avoid the odd objection based on the title or what  was heard on the grapevine or circulated on a photocopied collection of  excerpts out of context). If you yourself want to read it, by all means do  so, but read it at home. You'll know what it's all about and be able to  discuss it with those who have read it and discovered the power of the  printed word.

It also has the great  possibility of an excellent means of providing the number one valuable  lesson in media literacy: when the movie(s) come out, the children can see  for themselves how a movie pales in comparison to their much richer  individual imaginations. Leave this book to them to read at home, on the  bus, on the playground, in SSR, anywhere that allows them to read it for  themselves, as it's rare to find a book that motivates children to read not  only by its page-turning quality, its well-written pages, but by its being  the latest cool thing to do.ut of context).

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the most eagerly awaited book in history, by both children and adults alike, and it did not disappoint. Like the previous three, from the start it had me hooked, and I  finished it the day I got it. The Goblet of Fire is far longer than the  other books, being twice the size of The Prisoner of Azkaban, which is  great because it allows for a more complex plot and greater detail.<br />It  follows the trend set by `Azkaban' in being slightly darker than the  previous two, and we see less of that fairy tale magic, although there is  still enough there to make this book as enchanting as the others.<br />I think  of all the Harry Potter books, this is my favourite so far. Being slightly  older than the target reading audience (10/11 year olds), I preferred the  darker side to the plot and the amount of suspense and the way the author  manages to have you fearing for Harry's life. It is also good to see Harry,  Ron and Hermione beginning to grow up, and we see the three go on their  first dates.<br />Unfortunately, apart from the World Cup match between  Ireland and Bulgaria at the start of the book, there are no Quidditch  matches between the four houses. The annual Quidditch cup is replaced by a  triwizard tournament, where Hogwarts competes with two other wizarding  schools, which fills a large part of the book and adds some exciting twists  and turns to the book.<br />All the usual characters are involved, as well as  some new ones including Rita Skeeter, a reporter for the Daily Prophet who  plagues Harry throughout the book, and Mad-Eye Moody, the latest in a long  line of Defence against the Dark Arts teachers.<br />As usual, JK Rowling  writes a magnificent story with a complicated plot, some how managing to  weave all the tiny details together. The book has a spectacular finish,  perhaps her best yet, and leaves several un-answered questions ready for  book 5. The book gives the impression of being a turning point in the  series, and several big events happen which seem certain to have a big  impact on the remaining books. In books one and two, we were introduced to  the characters, and book three a lot of the background was filled in. In  book 4 the action really begins, and rather than being a complete story the  way the other three were, this seems to serve as the beginning to a much  bigger story, one that will continue through all the books in the  series.<br />Like all the others, Goblet of Fire manages to successfully blend  humour, supense and mystery, and keeps the reader guessing to the end.  Not  many children between the ages of 7 and 12 could fail to be impressed by  this, and the Harry Potter books are rare in the way that they manage to  enchant both adults and children alike.

J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series has managed to  captivate adults and children alike, so much so that the advance publicity  for the fourth volume--HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE--has achieved  epic proportions.  Could ANY book live up to all the hype?  In this case,  the answer is: Yes.  The story begins as the  now 14-year-old Harry weathers another summer with his hated and hateful  relations, the Dursleys, and eagerly looks forward to the Quidditch World  Cup, to which he has been invited by his best friend, Ron Weasley.  But  Harry and the Weasleys soon have more on their minds than wizard sports:  a  series of bizarre and frightening events unfold at the match that prove to  have lasting repercussions for all who attended.  Back at Hogwarts for his fourth year, Harry soon learns of another  surprise--namely, the Triwizard Tournament, a magical contest that is to  take place between Hogwarts and two more wizarding schools.  Three  champions, one chosen from each school by the Goblet of Fire, compete  against each other in feats of magical skill and daring.  Owing to the high  risk factor involved, however, Headmaster Dumbledore has decreed that only  students 17 and older may submit their names for contention as school  champion.  An intrigued Harry looks forward to watching the excitement from  the sidelines, along with pals Ron and Hermione.  But on the day that the  champions are to be chosen, the Goblet of Fire spits out the name of an  unprecedented fourth champion: Harry Potter.  Shocked and more than a  little alarmed by this surprise development, Harry now finds himself  competing against much older students, who regard him with scorn and  hostility, facing the jealousy of his peers (including Ron), and  ultimately, fighting not only for school honor but for his very life.  HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE has rightly been  referred to as a pivotal installment in the series, for it is in this  volume that Harry makes the transition from child to adolescent.  Besides  the Triwizard Tournament and the complications it brings to his life, Harry  is also contending with the problems of any normal teenage boy, such as the  onset of puberty and unrequited first love.  School continues to present  its own challenges--the animosity between Harry and Potions Professor  Severus Snape remains undiminished--and, as rumored, the death of a major  character casts a shadow over Harry's life, even as it clarifies the ordeal  that awaits him in the future:  a final confrontation with the evil wizard,  Lord Voldemort.

I knew this  book was going to be as spectacular, if not more, than the other three  Harry Potter books i had already read.  It lived up to my expectations.

Yes, i would  have to recommend it to anyone who is addicted to Harry Potter, and,  infact, anyone who is strange enough not to have read Harry Potter.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a really good book. The story continues, with Harry going to see the World cup with the Weaselys and Hermione. Voldemort rises to power, and gets a body. We see a return of  Pettigrew a.k.a. Wormtail. We hear more from Sirius, and Harry gets to  compete in the Triwizard Tournament, with Cedric Diggory. It has been  rumored that someone in the book was going to die, and it's true. I'm not  going to say who it is, but I WILL say a few things: the person is a  Quidditch player, and is not in Gryffindor. Most of the Harry Potter books  so far had happy endings. This one didn't, because the death of a character  happened near the end. Although the ending was kind of sad, I liked this  book the most of all, because since I'm a fast reader, I usually read HP  books in about 1-2 hours, but this one took me about 5! I recommend this  book to everyone, of all ages. I've read many masterpieces, and I must say  that this book is the most amazing book that I've ever read! (And that's  saying a lot, too!)	2000-07-09

Rowling's prose has dealt with such dark issues before, and she herself announced that a character is set to die in this novel...  And also that  Harry has a growing interest in girls.  You can't help but try to speculate  what's going to happen in this book, the clues are so tantalizing.  I sort  of guessed correctly who Harry's squeeze was going to be, but Rowling  completely surprised me with the identity of the deceased.  The secrecy  surrounding Harry Potter 4 was done very well, and the book more than lives  up to your expectations.<br />  There was the increased security for all  bookshops, although one resourceful girl sneaked a copy out and read it  (she must have done a gone back in time charm).  Gringotts are most  displeased that she managed to steal a copy past the massive three-headed  dog that was guarding it.  However, it may have been unwise for them to  choose Fluffy...  The girl was seen carrying a gramophone player at the  time.<br />  Never mind.  Harry Potter himself has placed a silencing charm  upon her, for she has not yet revealed the plot (although this may also be  due to the sheer vastness of the book, which seems to be double or even  triple the usual Potter).  Secret preparations were in place for the  dispatch of the book.  The Hogwarts Express was pressed into service, and  every owl practiced with weights for a fortnight.  Even Buckbeak was  allowed back from exile in order to do his bit.  The password had to be  changed from 'Pig Snout', since muggle security guards seemed to find this  offensive. Everything had to be right for the biggest spell of magic ever.  The muggles think it's fiction, but we know better...<br />  I think the main  appeal of Rowling's books is not the character of Potter himself (most  often the visiting protagonists are much better sketched than the boy  himself).  Since all the novels revolve about Potter, I sometimes think  that it would be better to see Hogwarts through his eyes, in the first  person.  However, Rowling bewitches you with her plots, which are superb.  I hear it's a seven book series, and I believe that Rowling knows exactly  what's going to happen in the end.  Each volume seems to have clues for  future books, and now appear to be much more open ended, and thus more  compulsive.  Certainly, pre-orders for Harry Potter 5 are going to break  even more records in bookshops.<br />Hogwarts itself seems to have come  from Walpole's 'Castle of Otranto', with its ghosts and lively paintings.  However, Hogwarts is both far more benign and malign than Otranto, if that  makes any sense.  Certainly Rowling's prose is more polished than  Walpole's.  Although the narrative is very modern, there are quite a few  healthy references to the past.  I love Rowling's use of Latin, her playing  with words.  If anything though, I would probably want to branch Rowling  off into the more adult writing of Christopher Fowler and Joanne Harris.  Harris certainly has the same love of the Gothic, the Pre-Raphaelite  paintings, and last, but not least, chocolate.  In 'Blackberry Wine',  Harris' latest novel, there is just about the same high regard for the  media as Rowling produces here in 'The Goblet of Fire'.  I think that most  authors cannot but help put what they know into their writing, and I think  Rowling's sudden celebrity has added a powerful ingredient to these novels,  especially this one.<br />  What's most attractive about this series of novels  is the narrative progression.  Rowling lets Harry Potter grow up before our  eyes, so the books should become more mature as they go on.  Harry Potter's  certainly no Bart Simpson or Peter Pan, forever trapped in childhood - but  there's no doubt that he's every bit as immortal as they are.  I think his  appeal lies not in his being a fabulous wizard, but in the fact that he is  so human.  He's not a totally virtuous hero, he's not whiter than white,  and is more than capable of spite and mischief.  This makes him a far more  interesting protagonist in his fight against evil, a battle he only  conducts due to the dire circumstances of his parents' murder.<br />  But  Rowling's proved before that she can make you twist and turn with her  fiction.  There are plenty of surprises in this new book, which I'll not  reveal.  Let's just say that you hope that Harry Potter has much better  form than most English sportsmen seem to have at the moment... Of course, you  have to read all the books, and in sequence, to get proper enjoyment out of  them.  The Goblet of Fire is a very long book, but like Harry himself,  you'll be racing towards the end.  This is the best book in the Harry  Potter series - so far.  Rowling is the consummate entertainer: she always  leaves you wanting for more.<br />  Now, how about extending it to an eight or  nine book series?nd is more than capable of spite and mischief.

First and foremost, i must say that this is an incredible book.  I picked up a copy of the fourth Harry Potter book today, and i was taken aback at the sheer size of the book.  I planned on reading just a little  bit at a time (the other books in the series were short enough to read in  one sitting), but one hour of reading turned into two... and three... i  finally finished around midnight and was left with the satisfaction of  reading the best book i have in a long time.  It excells, as the  others have, at immersing you into the Harry Potter world, captivating your  senses and sending you through the emotional roller-coaster of Harry's  fourth year at Hogwarts. The book deals with many issues that the others  have hinted at: friendship, trust, love, and death. The striking presence  of death is what changes the world in this pivotal book. Rowling has opened  the door, past bluffs and threats, to a villain who is believably, and  truly, evil. This has opened up new levels of fear that made the book more  intense to read. The broader range of emotions has made this a deeper and  more somber book, but even better, and more thought-provoking than the  last.  Rowling has once again, in a brilliant book, brought the wizarding  world to life again.	2000-07-09

I like the way Harry seems to  be facing the same problems as normal kids, such as dealing with loneliness  to misunderstandings with his friends and having being rejected by a girl,  besides having to cope with Lord Voldermort :0). I would highly recommend  this book because it's not just another book on witchcraft and sorcery but  a story which touches the heart as well. Besides, descriptions of dancing  veelas, disastrous magic classes and slithering serperts are altogether  spell-binding!	2000-07-09

I picked up the book at the release party at midnight and read the whole thing in one day...It was so exciting! The suspense was great. At the Triwizard Tournament (my favorite part) Harry had to fight a dragon, go underwater to save Ron, and  get through a dangerous maze.  All my favorite characters were back.  It  seemed like Hagrid might get fired. Harry could have died several times,  Hermione was her usual self.  Then of course I was anxious to see who it  was that was going to die. (We all knew someone would). The biggest scare  of the book is when Voldemort rises again in a new body and duels with  Harry. I don't want to spoil the end so I won't tell you what happens.  If  you love Harry Potter, you have to read the Goblet of Fire.  It's  fantastic!	2000-07-09

I think that I speak for everyone out there when I say howexcited I was to finally get my hands on this book!  I just finishedreading all 734 pages and J.K. Rowling has truly outdone herself with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  Year four is a very different one for all the Hogwarts students- There will be no school quidditch(gasp!), and Voldemort and his followers continually gain power throughout the year, there is a particularly troublesome news reporter, and many other mysterious and odd charachters for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to ponder...The plot was entertaining with a very suprising yet fitting ending.  The book has all of JKR's humour, trademark creative names, and new quirky charachters. The Goblet is another one for the recordbooks and for the enjoyment of children of all ages!  After The shock at the end of the book, JK leaves us with a bit of a cliff-hanger for book five(sigh), we will all have to wait patiently(or impatiently)until next time!  We will at least have a vague Idea of where the plot has to go next year after all the myriad happenings this year at Hogwarts!	2000-07-09

Rowling once again brings vividly to life the fascinating world of witches and wizards.  Yet, on this go-around, the characters are a little more sophisticated, a little more intelligent,  and even a little funnier.  Ron Weasley seems to have grown up the most  and his sense of humor is a delight throughout the book.  Even Hermione  takes things a little more in stride.  The developing relationship between  these two is even more proof that Rowling is aware of the changes in her  readers. On the whole, this book is filled with fascinating magic, fierce  struggles between good and evil, detailed characterizations, and plain old  suspense.  Harry Potter might be the main character, but he would be  lifeless if it were not for the enchanting world in which he lives.  This  is another excellent book from J.K.

I was especially delighted when characters from previous books  showed up again (I won't say who though :) ) And the ending is by far the  best and most intense, and also the most leading with just enough strings  left to make you go crazy for the fifth.

Ick. I knew I couldn't say this right. This is a  good book...it has some funny parts and some cool ones...and besides, it's  Harry Potter...but it is very different. Very much darker.

Seeing Voldemort's sign is a creepy experience, and the  book leaves you with the feeling that there is more to come, much more...it  was creepy. However, J. K. Rowling was right when she said that everyone  fell in love with the wrong people. Also, Ron and Hermione's relationship  changed. The book just was, well, creepy...darker...more evil...urgghhh!

It's rare to find a book series where each installment keeps getting better and better, but the Harry Potter series is one. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire doesn't just continue the Harry Potter mythos, it broadens  and deepens it. Clocking in at a hefty 700-plus pages, it might be a little  too heavy to peruse in the bathtub, but it's such a swift read that I  knocked it off in one afternoon. Part of the fun of a series like this one  is that you get to meet old friends again, like Ron, Hagrid, Hermione, and  Dumbledore, while you also get the opportunity to meet new Rowling  creations, like Mad-Eye Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts  Teacher, who has a magical eye that can detect falsehood (very inconvenient  for students making up excuses about their homework) and see through  invisibility cloaks (much to Harry's alarm.) Harry contends with a host of  new challenges in this book, both magical (of course) and non-magical  (Harry's crush on the pretty and popular Cho Chang offers him as many  stomach-clenching moments as a Quidditch match.)I was afraid that as the  books got darker and more complex in their themes, the humor might be lost,  but never fear: Rowling's wit only serves to make the darker passages more  effective, and in some cases, very moving.

His start of the fourth year there is a new Dark  Arts teacher, Mr. &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody who is a friend of Arthur  Weasley.  It weaves us through a tale of Harry's classes and life during  his fourth year. Instead of a Quidditch match with each house of Hogwarts,  there is a Tri-Wizard Tournament, involving two other Wizarding schools  that continues throughout the school year.  There is a Yule Ball, too, to  add some awkwardness for the young wizards and witches lives.<br />Ms. Rowling  also writes of new an interesting characters, a house-elf named Winky (yes,  Dobby makes an appearance); a yellow journalist named Rita Skeeter; and a  wonderful Quidditch player named Viktor Krum; just to name a few.  There is  the usual sprinkling of wizarding tools (portkeys, omnioculars, etc.), and  treats, too.  In addition, we are also given the correct pronounciation of  Hermoine's name.<br />The book is much darker and longer than the previous  three.

I liked it because Harry Potter is one of the most wonderful and well rounded  characters, that one cannot help but be engrossed. Harry, in his 4th year  at Hogwarts, is saddened that there will be no Quidditch this year, but  delighted that a TriWizard Tournament will take it's place. There is only  one problem... only students over 17 can enter their names in the Goblet of  Fire, which is the Goblet that a student enters his or her name. To ensure  this rule, Dumbledore draws an age line around the Goblet. But  somehow.....some way, Harrys name gets in....and sure enough, his name is  called. No one knew, that this, this simple, friendly tournament, could be  linked with the Dark Lord... that could lead to Voldemort full power...  This book, filled with excitement and horror, will have you hooked from  beginning to end.	2000-07-09

Trying to review this without giving away anything is going to be difficult, so bear with me.<br />The Harry Potter books are growing up.

We discover a WHOLE LOT more about the Harry  Potter backstory, and we realize that not even Dumbledore has the answer  for everything.<br />This book is the turning point in the JK Rowlings series.  From the first chapter, it gets very serious indeed.  As JK Rowling  herself said, this book is where the series turn serious.  People will  start dying.<br />All this said, the same incredible world that existed in the  first 3 books is presented again here, although this time it is clouded  with the shades of grey that we all start seeing between good and evil when  we start to grow up.<br />-Daniel B.	2000-07-09

One, I was afraid that it might not live up to my expectations (which, after months of waiting, were fairly high). On the other hand, I was hopeful that it would be just as much fun  as the others. Well, thankfully, it was the second! Within ten minutes of  opening the book, I was back in Harry Potter's life, where you're just as  likely to get an earwax bean as a peach-flavor, where Floo powder rather  then cars are the norm, and where magic is part of everyday life. There  were the twists and turns we have come to expect from this author, and a  few in-jokes, and of course, the hilarity that keeps us reading. I did a  marathon read after recieving it at 9;15 this morning, and finished at 11  pm. Like the end of Prisoner of Azkaban says, it was as though I'd  swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp. It was that good.  The  story, specifically the end, was more intense then anything Harry has  experienced yet. Parents especially might want to read the end with their  younger children (8 and under). I refuse to give away any spoilers, since  this book MUST be read first-hand to get the full effect.  Five stars,  because sixteen million is not an option!	2000-07-09

But when I finally finished, I knew something was different about it from the other books, and that was that it had a sad, gloomy, depressed attitude from the first page. There were no real wisecracks from Fred and George Weasley, no  comments from Ron, etc. Yes, someone does die, and I was pretty sad when I  found out who it was, because I got to know him/her pretty well during this  book. One big dissapointment was no Quidditch, except for the Quidditch  World Cup which hardly lasted. I have a certain feeling that the books  5,6,and 7 might continue in this depressing manner, which I think could  very well ruin the series. Overall, this was might least favorite in the  series, being 734 pages of gloom. But if you like those type of stories,  you'll love this book.	2000-07-09

Rowling said this was the pivotal book in the seven-book series. She was right. The first three books, as great as they were, as now nothing more than extended prologues to what is the beginning of the real story - Harry Potter starting to realize his purpose, and his potential.<br />A true  page-turner, the 734 pages simply fly by, and I was left wanting more -  now! The introduction of the Triwizard Tournament and the existence of the  other two wizarding and witchcraft schools set the stage for what will  certainly become a broader stroke with which the forces of Lord Voldemort  will eventually be faced (and from which they will gain additional power?).<br />The one disappointment with this book, and frankly with the series so  far, is that it lacks character development in the darker characters -  Draco Malfoy and his ilk. However, given events in the final chapter, those  characters may take more substantive roles in the coming books.<br />The death  of one character was quick and stunning, yet will undoubtedly serve as a  foundation for things to come. The last few chapters actually had me choked  up - rare for a book. The emotions that come pouring out of everybody at  the end is a notable release for a series that, to that point, was nearly  emotionless.<br />A great read, good fun, thoughtful, introspective, and most  of all, leaving the reader longing for more. I thought I would be anxious  for the next Star Wars movie, or Matrix 2. Nonsense. The only future date I  care about is Harry Potter, book five.	2000-07-09

I loved all the action and magical mayhem that took place! So far, this was Rowling's best HP book, with HP two coming in second. The characters, plot, and settings worked so well together that it  was hard to put the book down! I cannot wait for HP book five to come out,  probably next year. I found this book to  be darker, dealing with much more  intense issues then the other three HP books...Rowling did warn that it  would be this way, but I was a little surprised at the ending. It seemed  horrific: blood-letting, decapitation, the rising of a dead body, but as an  older reader, I could understand these elements, and how they fit into the  plot, however, I would caution parents of young or younger children. I  don't recommend this book for any child under the age of twelve! Please  read the ending of HP four before allowing your kids to! Some might get  really scared or not understand what is going on! But all in all, a  fantastic  book...	2000-07-09

Harry Potter is growing up and he  is definitely changing but he has the same spirit as ever. Despite the ever  continuing increase in length of the books I was as drawn into the Hogwarts  and Quidditch world as ever before and hungry for more when it ended. The  book is described as pivotal and so it is with more depth being given to  Harry's and the people around him's past.

Rowling has done it again with the fourth book in the Harry Potter series, The Goblet of Fire.  However, readers should beware. This volume has a far darker aura than any of the other books so far.  In fact, it's  probably not appropriate for many younger children.<br />The forboding element  begins in the first chapter with the first death and Voldemorts scheme to  restore his health and kill Harry Potter and this feeling continues through  the rest of the book.<br />The plot revolves around the &quot;Triwizard  Tournament&quot; which hasn't been held for years due to the deaths of the  contestants.  Three rival schools (including Hogwarts) will have one person  from each school, chosen by &quot;the Goblet of Fire&quot; compete for the  win.  However, the contestants have to be 17.  The three contestants are  selected and then, to everyone's surprise, Harry Potter's name comes out of  the goblet and is to compete in the tournament as a fourth contestant.  From there, the plot becomes more and more involved, and eventually  involves the death of a semi-recurring character.<br />The book was an  excellent read and will definatly appeal to the more mature reader.  But  the subject matter is such that it would be best for parents to make the  decision on whether it's appropriate for their child to read.	2000-07-09

But is Harry still a  children's book hero?  Each book in the now four installment series has  increased in length from the last with the newest title weighing in at a  spectacular 734 pages, over twice the size of the first.  Few children are  apt to gobble up a 700+ paged book, even if it is the famous Harry Potter.  Also distancing this sequal from the others is its distinct vocabulary.  &quot;Askance,&quot; &quot;bigotry,&quot; &quot;amicable;&quot; hardly  words with which an eleven year old would be familiar.  Also a bit  surprising is the gruesome information Rowling provides about  Voldemort-related subjects.  The contents of Voldemort's revival potion are  quite explictly described as are the details of the many deaths that pepper  the novel.  But don't get me wrong.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  is a spectacular novel.  Twists in the plot, a plethora of new characters,  and all, if not more, of the previously noticed Harry Potter charm (Ron and  Harry have a fight, Harry's parentless dilemma, Ron and Hermione's  arguments) entangle the reader so thoroughly in the story line that the  time spent reading it seems to be nothing.  However, this Harry Potter  installmemt is more of a novel than a children's book. With Rowling's  growing renown, she is able to switch from catering to children to writing  for a more mature audience, and she seems to be loving every moment of it.  More adult subjects (elf slavery, government ineptitude, nosy gossip  columnist's meddling) make this more than just a &quot;Win the Quidditch  Cup and make Gryffindor proud&quot; book.  Not only does the reader have  the constant &quot;who-done-it&quot; problem to solve, he is now faced with  real, if magical, issues which cannot be ignored.  Rowling has made  Hogwarts a cauldron of events, and excitement abounds but is it all obvious  enough to attract even the youngest reader's attention?  Perhaps not.  Harry Potter has grown up fast and it is yet to be seen if his readers have  grown with him or if he must now go and build a reputation in the world of  legitimate novels.one-it&quot; problem to solve, he is now faced with  real, if magical, issues which cannot be ignored.

Well, this is what everyone has been wanting to know - was it worth all the hype? Well, I have been asking around all the people I know (it's only a day since it came out, but we've all finished it already) and the answer  I've been given is a resounding YES!  I thought the plot was, as JK  Rowling warned us, &quot;darker&quot; than the first three books, but it  did have some funny moments as well, which nicely balanced out the book,  and left us in even more suspense.  As with the first three books,  Rowling gave hints all the way through as to the ending - but never quite  enough for us to work out what that ending could be, and she once again  brought the suspense slowly to a climax, leaving me literally unable to put  the book down. I thought nothing could be better than the third HP book,  but she has proved me wrong.  I won't give the ending away, but it is  more of a cliffhanger than the other books, and already, one day after book  four came out, I am eagerly awaiting book five. In conclusion, I think that  it was definately worth all the hype - this was the best book in the world  but how could she leave it like that?	2000-07-09

The beginning of Harry Potter 4 started off quite dry in my opninon, and also had almost nothing to do with Harry.  The first  pieces really either could have been skipped and the reader would not have  known or it could have been shorter and a little more exciting.  Hearing a  guy speak for like two chapters about himself and plans is not exactly  exciting or the Harry way.  Goblet of Fire then starts to focus on Harry a  bit more.  When the trio gets back to Hogwarts (finally) it seems like  right off the bat that Ron and Harry aren't friends anymore and everything  crumbles.  Hermoine and Harry become more of friends but it wasn't like how  most of the Harry readers like; Ron's friendship with Harry was much more  humorous and plus you got a third insight into everything.  When you  finally get to the end of the book, everything starts falling apart.  Evil  rises but when the book closes almost none of the answer were solved and  the ending really left you waiting for more: a lot more!	2000-07-09

Hence writing a review for it is fundementally a futile task. And that is OK. This is fundamentally a nice, solid, engaging, and  very cute adventure and mystery story sat in a very pleasant millieu. It  manages the restrictions of a semi-mystery quite well, and ends in a  unexpected but very reasonable way. There is nothing horribly wrong with  this book. The characters are with few exceptions quite endearing, and the  writing style is quite entertaining. When it comes down to it, I quite  liked the book.  Not that it lacked faults. In my humble opinion cute  little entertaining books like this should be fairly short, unlike this 750  page tome. And so many of these pages could easily be shed. There is a  fairly long subplot about an anti-slavery campaign which is almost  completely superfluous, and is only resolved in a very uncomfortable way  (they LIKE to be slaves). Take out this and a love interest done with a  very heavy hand and you are down to a reasonably sized 500 page book.  And  I get the feeling that this book would not work well without reading the  first three novels in the series. There are plenty of unexpected references  to things magical which are explained in previous volumes. However those  who have read the previous books might struggle with how formulaic they  really are. The plot line &quot;Someone is trying to kill Harry, who is  it?&quot; Is getting a bit tiresome, and while characters from previous  novels do retain their charm, newer additions seem dry and lifeless. It is  possible that this book wrings the last life out of Harry Potter, but  personally, I prefer to think the originality present in the first will  reappear in the next sequel.	2000-07-09

This is possibly the most intense fantasy read I've ever experienced.  Thanks to the fact that I'm a bit walking-impaired at the moment, I had a three-hour block in which to read the book... and needed another half hour to recover.  Not a page is wasted in this story--every single word means  something.<br />The plot is darker than any previous book.  It starts out as  always, with Harry staying with the Dursleys over summer break, until he  receives an invitation from his best friend Ron to go to the Quidditch  World Cup.  However, it seems that there's followers of Lord Voldemort  afoot--called Death Eaters--and they've decided to mess things up, more  than a bit.  The story begins to become more and more convulted as it goes  along, so I simply suggest that you read the book.<br />My own personal  comments?<br />~There is *definitely* something between Ron and Hermione  (and the way to pronounce her name properly is in this book! it's at the  very top of page 419), although Hermione finds herself a boyfriend that  isn't Ron.  It's an interesting subplot. :)<br />~Yes, a character dies--  the scene where it happens reduced me to tears, and I had to put the book  down for a few moments.  But it's done really well.<br />~The new  teacher--Mad-Eye Moody--is a great, fascinating character, and as always  there's a huge backplot going on involving the Defense Against the Dark  Arts teacher that I only caught a glimpse of as I read the book, but made  perfect sense when I came to the end.<br />~Rita Skeeter is possibly the most  annoying character ever created...and the most backbiting.  She's like all  the supermarket tabloids rolled up in a bright maroon witches'  robe...<br />~Dumbledore has major guts.  Wow.  That's all I'm saying.<br />In  conclusion?<br />This book is a well-thought out, well-executed, all around  captivating piece of fantasy literature.  It's definitely not for any kids  under nine (too dark and intense and creepy!  let them read the first three  over and over, and when they get older give them the fourth to read), but  everyone else will alternatively have a blast and have shivers over this  book.<br />Aw, forget me, just go out and read it!over and over, and when they get older give them the fourth to read), but  everyone else will alternatively have a blast and have shivers over this  book.<br />Aw, forget me, just go out and read it!	2000-07-09

This is easily the  best book I've read all summer.  Not to be missed, even if you lost your  childhood years ago.  Here's your chance to find it again.<br />For returning  Harry Potter fans, not only is the plot as engaging as ever, Rowling also  manages to develop Harry's personality further, without losing her deft  touch in combining previous action with new adventures.  For new readers,  the seamless inclusion of Harry's previous adventures makes it easy to  understand the plot.<br />&quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is more similar to  &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; than the first two books, and far more  ambitious.  Not only is it a much longer read (not that I mind!), Rowling  also further blurs the line between the muggle and wizarding world,  especially with the introduction of the Quidditch Cup.  Old characters pop  up and exit the novel with more depth than when they entered the narrative,  quietly exhibiting their ability to hold their own against Harry's  flamboyant presence.  From Ron and Hermione to Sirius and  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, prepare to meet these characters who have grown  since the previous books.

I don't know what other word to use to describe Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Harry returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year in a book that grabs you in the first chapter and keeps you until the end. The  Quidditch World Cup, Voldemort, Sirius Black, Death Eaters, the Triwizard  Tournament - all part of what will certainly become the essential volume in  the Potter series. Aside from several new characters (Professor Moody! ),  we also meet a few we have until now only heard about (notably Bill and  Charlie Weasly). The tension-filled ending, where lines are drawn and  characters choose their side in the battle of good (Dumbledore) and evil  (Voldemort) will have many people joining me in cheering Ms. Rowling for  another superb, thrill-ride of a book and begging her to hurry with volume  five!	2000-07-09

Many old friends are brought back; and many people are examined and explained in a new light.  I won't give too much away, for those who  have not read it, but nothing is as it seems in this book.  As the  characters are forced to examine each other, we ourselves are forced to do  the same.  The battle of good and evil is fought again, perhaps more direly  than before.  The ending surprised me, and I closed the book with many  questions left from previous books answered, and many more new questions to  take their place.

Harry is  again a reluctant hero, one that kids and grownups can relate to and cheer  for.  I read it in one big gulp, it's impossible put down.

The sense of fun and place, full and interesting characters, quirky details, and interlocking mysteries (large and small)  are still there. Added are new characters, dimensions and adventures for  Harry and others, a sense of the larger wizarding world, and hints of  struggles to come.<br />I read it at one stretch and it didn't seem long.  It's age appropriate but with much to offer grups as well. The only caveats  are a wish for less artificiality in the way Harry gets historical  information, and a little more first-person sharing of what's going on in  Ron's and Hermione's heads when they're undergoing struggles and life  changes.<br />The Dursleys are a challenge but Harry gets around them with his  growing understanding, and soon Harry is off to the Weasley's. No Diagon  Alley this time (Mom does the shopping &lt;sigh&gt;): he gets World Cup  quidditch and the mysterious aftermath. The quidditch match at the  beginning was very detailed.<br />Once school starts there are many familiar  elements but also twists. I laughed out loud several times during the early  sections but after that it was somewhat less prankish than past books. The  Triwizard Tournament soon begins and Harry is included though he is  underage and another champion from Hogwarts is already chosen. Though  wondering about motives he is bound by the rules to participate. The  competition include lots of exciting and suspenseful activities, so the  quidditch wasn't missed.<br />Harry's relationship with Ron goes up and down  but Hermione remains steadfast. In the end they are a team, but there are  times of doubt and pain. There's a continuing sense of Harry feeling  separate from the rest of the world that's sometimes due to events and  sometimes regular pre-teen stuff kids will likely identify with.  The  mysteries grow and we learn more about characters and relationships,  deepening understanding of previous events and foreshadowing the future.  For example, his patience toward the hapless Neville seems in books 1&amp;2  merely nearness or decency, but in book 3 we see parallels in his father's  friendship with Pettigrew (aka Wormtail and Scabbers). Then in book 4 we  and Harry learn more about Neville's family tragedy and begin to see him  differently. Though little is done with it here I expect more top come.  These bits are not always separated out so you have to pay attention- the  suspenseful action is sometimes a little distracting, so a second  read-through helps more background and clues stick.<br />The much ballyhooed  romance is just dawning, and I was glad. He is still a little young for  more than a crush. It and many other events give us hints of the man Harry  is shaping up to be, and for the most part he is something to be proud of-  though patches of stubbornness remain to grow out of.<br />There are several  deaths but mostly &quot;off screen.&quot; None are gory. One is a known but  not central student, and though Harry's reaction was delayed it was  proportional. The ending had unanticipated elements, but logical once  explained. My advice- remember things are seldom entirely what they seem in  the magical world.previous events and foreshadowing the future.

Elements from the first three books tie in with the fourth, and along with little touches, really gives scope to Harry's world and makes a person think it is real. Book four will make you want to read it right through from the beginning to end without putting it down. And no matter how long it is, when you finish, you just want to keep reading more. When the book does end, there's a thousand questions you'll want to know, and number one is 'When does book five come out?', something that every Harry Potter fan will be counting the days to.

Not only are you able to read about the same familiar characters that we all love so much, Rowling manages to introduce several new characters who you will find  just as unforgettable, such as the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher.  You also find more background  about characters such as Snape and Hagrid;  she also gives more details about the time right after Voldemort lost power  and what happened to his followers. Harry and the gang are growing up and  start to deal with issues like boy/girl relations. Herimone even gets a  boyfriend and someone is a little jealous. And yes- a recurring character  does die which is a sad part in the book. It is still full of humor like  when the Weasleys go to the Dursleys and George and Fred get hold of  Dudley.  You also find out that there are other schools like Hogwarts. The  end is fantastic but she leaves many issues unresolved that will leave you  clamoring for book 5.

And while, the book needed to be  that long to set up all the plot intricacies that makes Rowling's book so  enjoyable, the book's length keeps pushing the reader's expectations higher  and higher. It took 200 pages for the book to really get going, and 500  (yes 500 pages) for it to begin to reach the level of intensity that made  Harry Potter 3 so incredible. It's difficult to continue to write books  that are always in the same time frame (one school year) and Rowling tries  to play with that, but the effect is more disarming then anything else. You  want Harry to get to Hogwarts already! (not take 200-odd pages to get  there). The last 200 pages are excellent, albeit dark.

The plot doesn't veer very far from the structure of the previous  books, but there is a darker edge to the story, with death in the first few  paragraphs, twists and turns when you try to figure out who is Voldemort's  faithful servant, and the memories of Azkaban trials.  I probably won't be  the first to question Rowlings' choice for the &quot;beloved  character&quot; who dies (he didn't register the first time I read him in  the previous books).

I'm 15 and I have read all of the other Harry Potter books many times. This book is the best so far, I believe. It has a lot of suspense and surprise in it. I couldn't put it down. Two characters from the second and  third books reappear- Sirus Black, Harry's Godfather, and Dobby, the House  Elf. The book also includes the traditional encounter with Lord Voldemort,  only it is more intense than usual.

I bought this at one in the morning on Saturday, read it yesterday at the beach, and finished it at two this afternoon (on Sunday). It's incredible, all seven hundred something pages of it.  Like the previous  books in the series, it covers a year in the life of Harry Potter, as he  goes through his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft.  Harry is now fourteen, and has to deal not only with the trials of  adolescence, but also with the growing power of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...  Lord Voldemort.  Back to help-or hinder- Harry in his trials this year are  his friends Ron and Hermione, the headmaster Dumbledore, and many others  from the previous books, including his godfather, Sirius Black.<br />I don't  want to spoil the book for those who haven't read it, but the excitement  this year at Hogwarts concerns the Triwizard Tournament, a competition  among Hogwarts and two other rival schools of witchcraft and wizardry.  Competitors from other schools not only provide excitement in the  tournament, but also among the hearts of some students of Hogwarts...but  I'm not telling who!  Suffice it to say, this is a necessary read for  everyone who has read the others in the series, and even those who haven't  will still enjoy it.  Though many may think this series is just for kids,  I'm living proof that adults enjoy it too. The layers of this book provide  a good story for those just looking for that, but there are also little  nuggets for adults that kids may not catch, especially in names.  For  example, Sirius Black, Harry's godfather that we met in &quot;Prisoner of  Azkaban, is an Animagi who can turn into a big black dog.  In astronomy,  Sirius is the Dog Star...  Little things like this make the books even  richer.<br />So...in closing, GO READ THIS BOOK!  In my opinion it more than  lived up to all the hype surrounding its release.  This fourth installment  in the Harry Potter series only makes me anticipate the next all the more.	2000-07-09

Obviously aiming for an older audience this time, the lengthly book was not anything like as good as the  first 3. Not to give too much away, the death of 'one of the main  characters' was a real let-down, as they could hardly be described as a  central character. The middle part of the book, where Harry and Ron's  hormone's kick in was reminiscent to the previous books, and in my opinion  the best part of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. However, I still feel  J.K. Rowling could have made better use of it, and extended it. But the  rest of the book, with it's far darker undertones, was a disapointment, to  say the least. I can only hope that this is not the way that J.K Rowling  will continue with the 3 books in the series to come. Although a good book  on its own, comparing it with the other 3 books, it has none of the  brilliance that made Harry Potter such a phenomenal success.	2000-07-09

The new Harry Potter book is indeed a triumph by J.K. Rowling.As always, her character development, plotlines, and imagery shinethrough. Harry comes face-to-face with some of his darkest fears and at the end of the book, it becomes evident that the sides are being drawn for the next three to come.  Indeed this is a pivotal book in the series!<br />By far the darkest book so far, (in fact, I'm a bit concerned over the reaction my 10 year old may have with some of the more vivid scenes), J.K. Rowling neatly introduces young readers to foreshadowing. Some may guess who ends up dead, I did only a few pages before it happened. Many old suspicions are answered, and quite a few more laid down.<br />Harry notices girls for the first time, and predictably acts exactly as most 14 year old boys would act on a first date!  Ron increasingly becomes more uncomfortable with the differences between he and Harry, and Hermione also &quot;re-creates&quot; herself!<br />The biggest developments of course occur with Harry. In all of his previous &quot;life-and-death&quot; struggles&quot; he has been assisted somewhat by the &quot;chair of the gods&quot; technique, ie.  Fawkes arriving at the EXACT split second he needed him; Hermione revealing at the last moment her &quot;time-turner&quot; This time, there are no last minute rescues by friends, but rather a much more mature Harry dealing with evil himself.  And at the end, the reader can see the boyish layers peeling off and revealing more than a hint of the man to come.<br />An excellent read overall, but unlike the other 3, I did not put this down with a smile, but rather a feeling of unease as the world that J.K. Rowling has invented feels increasingly more real with each book.	2000-07-09

I purchased this book at nine a.m. on July 8 and read it nonstop until I finished at 7 p.m. This is, by far, the best of the Harry Potter books. It certainly has a more developed, mature voice to it than the others, but  its' magical, charming tone is as wonderful as the first three books.  Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts brings all kinds of new adventures as he is  chosen to represent his school in a Triwizard competition, pitting him in  dangerous tasks against champions from two other wizarding schools. Despite  its' great length, the story never feels overlong, and the plot is fresh  and engaging. All the great old characters are back, plus some good new  ones- we finally are introduced to Bill and Charlie Weasley! And if you  think the first three books were exciting, this one is simply dripping with  suspense. I think Harry's older, more mature fans will find this to be the  most pleasing Harry adventure to date, due to its' intense themes and newly  introduced hormones between the Hogwarts students. With traces of violence,  romance and tragedy, this book will defenitly appeal to Harry Potter fans  young and old, but I think the readers like me, around Harry's age of  fourteen, will sink into it the most. Don't miss this one- get your hand on  it as quickly as you can!	2000-07-09

We learn more about Hogwarts' history and place in the world, gain more spells, more characters (and fabulous fantastic creatures) to adventure with, and more tightly woven details constructing the wizarding world, but the context of that world (from Harry's view) also becomes more complex.  Good still battles evil, but now Harry begins to discern distinct factions arming both sides, and that not everyone is willing to choose a camp.<br />To make character development even more interesting, he and his friends discover their own relationships are not as cleanly defined as they were last year, and I laughed and worried as they struggled with their unstable adolescence.<br />I really admire Rowlings' ability to 'grow' her level of storytelling along with the complexity of the plot and characterization.  I found this to be the funniest book so far, tempting those awaiting their turn with the book with my frequent laughter.  It also has the scariest consequences of the series so far, as Rowling reveals more details of exactly how Voldemort operates.<br />Although I think those 8-9 year olds tearing through the series will be more than satisfied with Book 4, they may well appreciate it from a different vantage point should they reread it later - but then all of the HP's benefit from a second or third turn - if you can get them back from whoever you lent them.  Bring on Number 5!	2000-07-09

The book is heavy.<br /><br />So my question is: do the contents justify the weight?

On the  negative side, I think about 200 pages from this book could have been cut  without feeling any ill effects. This was the only one of the four Potter  books that I sometimes skimmed over and that I felt were a bit slow.<br /><br />On  the other hand, the book sure kept me up all night, turning the pages.  Rowling is one of the hardest writers to put down since, I don't know,  Asimov or something.<br /><br />I felt there was a bit of a disharmony between style  and content: the style was aimed at very bright 12 year olds, but the  content was aimed at 16 year olds or more. I mean, it was more than  \\"dark\\": it was painful, gloomy, grotesque, horrific - with scenes  of torture and tragedy that would not have been out of place the Odyssey or  even at times Dante.

The sense of fun and place, full and interesting characters, quirky details, and interlocking mysteries (large and small)  are still there. Added are new characters, dimensions and adventures for  Harry and others, a sense of the larger wizarding world, and hints of  struggles to come.<br />I read it at one stretch and it didn't seem long.  It's age appropriate but with much to offer grups as well. The only caveats  are a wish for less artificiality in the way Harry gets historical  information, and a little more first-person sharing of what's going on in  Ron's and Hermione's heads when they're undergoing struggles and life  changes.<br />The Dursleys are a challenge but Harry gets around them with his  growing understanding, and soon Harry is off to the Weasley's. No Diagon  Alley this time (Mom does the shopping &lt;sigh&gt;): he gets World Cup  quidditch and the mysterious aftermath. The quidditch match at the  beginning was very detailed.<br />Once school starts there are many familiar  elements but also twists. I laughed out loud several times during the early  sections but after that it was somewhat less prankish than past books. The  Triwizard Tournament soon begins and Harry is included though he is  underage and another champion from Hogwarts is already chosen. Though  wondering about motives he is bound by the rules to participate. The  competition include lots of exciting and suspenseful activities, so the  quidditch wasn't missed.<br />Harry's relationship with Ron goes up and down  but Hermione remains steadfast. In the end they are a team, but there are  times of doubt and pain. There's a continuing sense of Harry feeling  separate from the rest of the world that's sometimes due to events and  sometimes regular pre-teen stuff kids will likely identify with.  The  mysteries grow and we learn more about characters and relationships,  deepening understanding of previous events and foreshadowing the future.  For example, his patience toward the hapless Neville seems in books 1&amp;2  merely nearness or decency, but in book 3 we see parallels in his father's  friendship with Pettigrew (aka Wormtail and Scabbers). Then in book 4 we  and Harry learn more about Neville's family tragedy and begin to see him  differently. Though little is done with it here I expect more top come.  These bits are not always separated out so you have to pay attention- the  suspenseful action is sometimes a little distracting, so a second  read-through helps more background and clues stick.<br />The much ballyhooed  romance is just dawning, and I was glad. He is still a little young for  more than a crush. It and many other events give us hints of the man Harry  is shaping up to be, and for the most part he is something to be proud of-  though patches of stubbornness remain to grow out of.<br />There are several  deaths but mostly &quot;off screen.&quot; None are gory. One is a known but  not central student, and though Harry's reaction was delayed it was  proportional. The ending had unanticipated elements, but logical once  explained.

I was about the 180,000'th customer to pre-order &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; on Amazon.com.  On Saturday, July 8th, I went out--but at the stroke of midnight, I dragged my friend to the nearest bookstore to witness possibly the biggest publishing event of my lifetime.  As a Harry Potter fan I have grown very fond of Harry and take people's  appreciation for him quite personally--I know I'm not J.K. Rowling,  but my  heart beat quite fast when I saw long lines looping around the shelves of  books in both of the biggest bookstores in my town!  Children, parents,  adults, all waiting to get a dose of their magic in the middle of the  night!  Although I wasn't purchasing the book I still got my share of  Potter magic early on (I also managed to snatch a pair of HP glasses and a  lightening bolt tattoo:)).<br />Saturday dawned into day and I found myself  not sleeping well, and finally dragging myself downstairs to await the  FedEx delivery man lest I wouldn't hear the doorbell from upstairs.  I was  a bit disappointed to find out that he wasn't showing up any time soon, and  went out to lunch.  I am not a bit ashamed to admit it, I found myself  dragging a friend (another one this time) yet again to the same bookstores  to inquire about Harry Potter events going on.  Well, well, they were OUT  of the book!  Now Amazon was back in my graces, since I preferred having  the book delivered in the peace of my home rather than having to wait in  lines for hours or risking the book being--&lt;gasp&gt;--sold out within 8  hours!  I once again felt my heart full as I congratulated Harry Potter  (under my breath) of his spectacular success.<br />When I arrived home around  7 o'clock, my book was resting safely on my doorstep.  Letting out a  squeal, completely unabashed for a twenty-year old, I grabbed the box and  made a run for kitchen scissors!  Starting from 8:00 PM (after all I had to  see my friend off politely) to the early dawn of 4 o'clock the next  morning, I was happily lost in the wonderful, magical world of Harry  Potter.<br />Now, I am sure there will be sniggering critics (who will remind  me strongly of Draco Malfoy) complaining about the chaotic plot line,  unfocused episodes (such as Hermione's gallant efforts to start the  S.P.E.W, which seem to fade away from the story unresolved), and as Rowling  has told us before, increasingly dark tone of the book that may scare our  young muggles.  HOWEVER, let me say this in defense:  Harry Potter lives as  vividly and as truly as any one of us in J.K. Rowling's world--and in mine  and in many of yours--and so, as unfocused and complicated and dark as this  book may be, it is Harry Potter's world and he lives it wonderfully, and we  love him for it.  Through the chaos of the Qudditch World Cup, conflicts  with his friends and enemies, and the Three Tasks he must overcome, he  becomes more and more dear in our hearts.  In my eyes, the complexity of  the plot and detailed accounts of his adventures at Hogwarts make him all  the more real and wonderful, now more than ever.<br />Excellent adventures,  involuntary gasps (esp. if you are reading this in your commuting subway),  laughters that will bring tear into your eyes, and the remarkable  Rowling-esque twists and turns in the plot await you.  Be ready to welcome  Harry Potter into your world.  This is history in the making!<br />PS:  do not  worry too much about the forewarned death in this book--it is certainly sad  but the character had not been developed by Rowling enough for us to break  our hearts over--that would have been too cruel!rning, I was happily lost in the wonderful, magical world of Harry  Potter.<br />Now, I am sure there will be sniggering critics (who will remind  me strongly of Draco Malfoy) complaining about the chaotic plot line,  unfocused episodes (such as Hermione's gallant efforts to start the  S.P.E.W, which seem to fade away from the story unresolved), and as Rowling  has told us before, increasingly dark tone of the book that may scare our  young muggles.

Rather than begin by summarizing the story, I shall straight off say that this book, Rowling's most expensive, most lengthy and by far the most  anticipated  (I don't remember any all night parties for Book 2, do you?)  definately gives the reader a run for their money.  The 700 page novel is  filled to brim with action though, as one might expect with a book of such  length, runs on a bit.  But take note, it DEFINATELY does not drag.  In  fact the story is a page turner right to the very end.  As with many good  books, the reader is dragged in and the size of the book is forgotten in  the intensity of the story.  Personally I liked seeing the magical world  expanded as new nationalities of wizards and witches are introduced.  I do  not consider this the greatest novel of all time, it does exhibit literary  weaknesses.  Some characters instead of taking on more depth as the story  unfolds are merely reiterated somewhat incessantly.  Is the ending  needlessly complicated?  I think that once unfolded, the villains' evil  plans are extremely confusing. However, Rowling is dealing with an  imaginary and magical world, none too simple in its workings and which must  be explained without contradicting itself.  The books many adventures may  be a bit confusing and drawn out for younger audiences but it is certainly  one of the most exciting children's novels to come along in a while.  Above all Rowling exhibits a definate flair for humor, and suspense.  Without a doubt her imaginative and colorful storytelling are her greatest  assets.  The characters and the world she creates reveal an imagination  rivaling that of George Lucas.  This 4th installment is a worthy addition  to the shelf of previously acclaimed Harry Potter novels and lives up to  the illustrious legacy. A good buy, whether you've read all the books or  not. Indeed, Rowling hasn't lost her touch.	2000-07-09

K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  This time, the magic gets out of hand!<br />First, remember the sleepy but mysterious village of Little  Hangleton.  The Riddle House is not a place for riddles, but a home where  the family died of fright. The man accused of murdering them was eventually  released.  When he returns to the Riddle House, he overhears a curious  conversation between someone named Wormtail and a terrible, dark presence  by the name of Lord Voldemort -- oh, so sorry...He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.  Volde... (oops, almost said it again) He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is one of  the most powerful Dark wizards -- and he wants Harry Potter.<br />When Harry  wakes from a particularly vivid dream, the scar on his forehead throbs, and  he knows something is up. Harry's been living in a dreadful house on Privet  Drive with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and greedy cousin, Dudley. They  won't even let him do any wizardry -- you know Muggles, how they can't  really handle that kind of stuff.<br />Harry's uncle and aunt like to let the  neighbors think that Harry goes to St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably  Criminal Boys rather than to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He  has to hide his magic -- and even broomsticks aren't a suitable topic of  conversation in the Dursley household. But everything is about to change  for Harry, beginning with this particular summer vacation.<br />It starts with  a letter from Mrs. Weasley, Harry's friend Ron's mother. She invites him to  come spend the rest of the summer with the Weasleys and to go see the  Quidditch World Cup. Quidditch is Harry's favorite sport in the world, and  it isn't often that the Quidditch World Cup is in Britain.  Faster than you can say &quot;Hogwarts,&quot; Harry travels by fire to  the Burrow, and the dark and threatening adventure begins.<br />  On the way, Harry discovers that his interest in girls is becoming  more nerve-wracking -- how is a young wizard to ask a girl to the Yule  Ball? And  what of the Goblet of Fire itself? And the  Triwizard Tournament? And then, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named might be seeking  Harry out even now!<br />  Who can resist a Harry Potter  tale? J. K. Rowling has proven again that her international success seemed  inevitable -- from the first page of Harry  Potter and  the Goblet of Fire, the story soars. It is beautifully written, with a  strong narrative and fascinating, unforgettable characters, and there  is not a reader in the world who won't love this book. The  novel is long - more than 700 pages -- and not one word is wasted.<br />  Now, my only problem is I need to find Harry so I can start  classes at Hogwarts, soon. I sent him a message by owl, just this morning.more nerve-wracking -- how is a young wizard to ask a girl to the Yule  Ball? And  what of the Goblet of Fire itself? And the  Triwizard Tournament?

Ms. Rowling has really outdone herself this time.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a BLAST!  Easily the longest Harry Potter book yet, the Goblet of Fire is the pivotal center of the saga that spans Harry's seven  years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br />  After an  awful summer with the insufferable Dursleys, the Weasleys, as promised,  invite Harry to the Quidditch World Cup.  But someone (hmm... I wonder who  THAT could be) is once again out to kill Harry, and it doesn't look like  he's going to be getting out of it that easily this time.  At the Quidditch  World Cup, Harry, our unassuming hero, is reunited with his best friend Ron  Weasley and the ever-clever Hermione (Her-MI-oh-knee), who also attend  Hogwarts with him.  Events begin snowballing into another rip-roaring  adventure as soon as the three friends leave the World Cup-- they return to  Hogwarts and receive surprising news (I won't spoil it for you).  Harry of  course meets his old nemesis, Draco Malfoy and the vindictive Professor  Snape.  He also encounters some friends from books past and even meets some  new ones.  As for what the Goblet of Fire is and how it relates to Harry,  well, you will just have to find that out for yourself.<br />  I don't  dare say any more, except this: READ THE BOOK!  I'm sure you'll love it as  much as I did.  As the plot unfolds, you'll find yourself drawn deeper into  the mystery and adventure that seem to follow Harry wherever he goes.  Many  secrets are revealed about some of our favorite characters and, yes, just  as Ms. Rowling said, someone does die.  It is very tragic.  Harry, despite  his courage in the face of terrible evil (i.e. Voldemort), seems to have  problems with girls...<br />  If it is possible, I loved this book even  more than the last one, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  It looks  like dark times will be upon the wizarding world in book five; it sure is  going to be a long wait for that to be published.  Already I feel  impatient, just like Harry when he's counting down the days until school  starts... For now, just enjoy J. K. Rowling's awesome fourth book, Harry  Potter and the Goblet of Fire.I feel  impatient, just like Harry when he's counting down the days until school  starts... For now, just enjoy J. K.

Harry spends the last two weeks of summer at The Burrow to see the thrilling Quidditch world  cup.  At Hogwarts there is a competition called the Triwizard tournament.  3 schools come, Devin Slang, Beauxbatons, and Hogwarts, to compete for the  Triwizard Cup, which in order to twin, have to face dangerous challenges.  You have to be 17 or older to compete, and to sign in, you have to write  your name and school on a piece of parchment, and then place it into the  Goblet of Fire.  Then 1 person from each school is chosen from the Goblet,  and someone put Harry's name in it, and labeled under a different school,  so instead of having 3 competitors Harry was chosen to be a fourth. While  Harry is competing in the tournament, Voldermort tries to regain his power  and body.  Harry has to complete three tasks to win.  Harry meets up with  more than just the tournament, he meets with the parcel-mouth talking  wizard Voldermort.<br />I recommend you should read this book because Harry's  adventures last longer than the other books and it will keep you  entertained for a lot longer.

I had anticipated the release of this book ever since I had started the Harry Potter series. This time, Harry does not struggle as much with the Dursleys, as he is only there for two weeks. He spends the rest of the  summer with the Weasleys, who take him and Hermione to the Quidditch final,  Bulgaria vs. Ireland. After the tournament, a dark sign is seen in the sky.  It is the sign of the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort. There is much worry about  you-know-who coming back to power. As Harry arrives at Hogwarts, there is  the disappointing news that there will no house quidditch games. Instead,  Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament and two foreign wizarding  schools will be coming to Hogwarts to take part. There has not been one for  a hundred years, because of contestants being killed. Students age 17 and  over are to submit their names to the Goblet of Fire, and that will choose  the three contestants, one from each school. As the three chosen  contestants march off, the goblet shoots another name from its mouth,  &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. Everyone was astonished, because Harry would not  have been able to get past the age barrier the headmaster put around the  goblet to keep younger students out.

Although this book was long, my daughter and I loved it.  We got it this morning, and couldn't put it down.<br />What I like about Rowling's stories is her consistency and use of the characters.  She weaves new and old  characters in the fabric of her stories.  Most of the rumors were true  about this book, but as always, the ending was different than I had hoped.  My daughter missed Harry Potter playing his favorite sport, Quidditch.  However, since there is so much to this book, to tell more wouldn't be a  good idea. In every school year, we like Harry, learn so much about this  magic world of Rowling's.  She really keeps the action going in her  stories; like the Sirius Black situation. She captures her audience in this  wonderfully written story, about a boy and his journey to become a wizard.  This truly is a magical series that will take you where no imagination has  gone before. You can picture this world of magic, excitement, mystery, and  enchantment, all rolled into one story.  After reading this story, I now  more theories about the seventh book.  However, I think Ms. Rowlings will  surprise me.<br />By the way, PETA might have some grievance against Sirius.  I was very happy to see him back.<br />Also, I changed my opinion of Snape  in this book.  Snape and Sirius - start of beautiful friendship?	2000-07-09

In this, the fourth book in the delightful Harry Potter series from author J.K. Rowling, our young hero finds himself tangled in yet another sticky situation. The first few chapters set a tense feeling that carries on  throughout the entire text of this 700+ page novel, and the typical charm  and elegnce of Rowling's writing keeps readers both young and old glued to  each moment. Enough about the writing, now on to the story. Note that no  spoilers will follow- read it yourself! Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  starts off from where Book 3, Prisoner of Azkaban, ended, with Harry at his  Uncle Vernon's home. A startling nightmare awakens him, and he is confused  as to its meaning. It turns out that all is not well in the wizarding  world, and that an evil plot is brewing in the shadows. All the time  avoiding his enemies (and finding time along the way for a bit of romance),  young Potter must find a way to quell the problem and set things right  again. If you have read the other three books, be sure to pick this one up  right away. You'll be pleasantly surprised.	2000-07-09

I found this episode even more  enjoyable than the last. Harry is growing up and capable of doing many  things-even if he has doubts about being able to do them.

K Rowling has accomplished a task every bit as difficult as apparating or summoning a Patronus:  she has written a book which exceeds the hype surrounding its release.  I couldn't put it down, and read it in one  sitting before turning it over to my eleven-year-old daughter.<br />Rowling's careful plotting of her seven-tome series is nowhere more  evident than in this fourth installment.  She ties together events from the  earlier books with tantalizing hints about what is to come.  Her characters  stay true to themselves, while continuing to grow and mature.  Many authors  struggle keeping this kind of consistency in a series, but Rowling succeeds  beautifully.  Fans of the series will particularly enjoy how Rowling starts  to flesh out secondary characters, now that Harry and his friends are well  established.<br />A few warnings: although Rowling recaps some elements from  previous books, a reader beginning the series in the middle will no doubt  be confused.  This is one series that really must be read sequentially.  Also, the evil elements become even darker and scarier in this installment.  Some events might be too gruesome for younger children to hear.  Any child  mature enough to read a 742 page book, though, should be able to handle the  darker material.<br />As the pivotal book of the series, The Goblet of Fire  really leaves the reader in suspense at the end--much like the end of The  Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars Trilogy--meaning that there will be  even more hype surrounding the release of volume five, which can't happen  too soon to suit me!	2000-07-09

Without a doubt, the Harry Potter books may by themselves bring back quiet afternoon reading. I received this 734 page missive via Sat delivery (thank you Amazon) and settled in for several hours of reading.<br />The Goblet of  Fire continues the traditional events of the previous books, but with more  character development.  The pace is, unforunately, slower and will lack the  excitement found in the Quidditch matches of the previous books.  The  appeal of real-life, however, with the falling out of friends, the dreaded  &quot;first-date&quot; scenario, will resonate well with the equivalent age  group, as well as the adults who remember this book. It did lack the  incredible visual imagition appeal of the eaarlier books, where people  nearly lived scenes (Quidditch, facing down Tom Riddle and his snake),  leaving us to work harder to make it sing.<br />Harry's usual life-or-death  dealings do keep you reading, but I found the ending to be tamer than  earlier books. All in all, a slower pace, more emotion and characer  development, more interaction will make this a satisfying read for older  readers, but the excitement and thrill of the earlier books, as well as the  escapism of Hogwarts will make this a tougher sell to younger readers, like  my son. Indeed, certain aspects might lead to real-world discussssions, on  death and dying, on honor and on fairness.<br />I'd still recommend this book;  I read it straight through.

With all the buildup and hype and so forth for the release of the 4th installment in the Harry Potter series I dreaded that the book wouldn't measure up, that all the excitement would be for  nothing. But the brilliant J.K. Rowling has done it again- with a book,  that, in my opinion, is the best in the series so far. In this book, Harry  sees the Quidditch World Cup, discovers girls, is entered in a sort of  spell duel, meets some new friends and foes, becomes farther and then  closer to his friend Ron, and once again has a brush with, well,  You-Know-Who.... but I won't give it all away. After hungrily devouring  over 700 pages of glorious fiction in about 4 hours, I was left with a grin  on my face, a feeling of triumph for Harry, and a pang that told me the  book was over; and that, alas, I would have to wait a while for the  sequel... Thank you J.K. Rowling! What a wonderful, magical phenomenon you  have created.	2000-07-09

The reason for this is that it's full of action as well as important character developments. I  read it as eagerly and quickly as any of the other books.<br />Harry Potter  and the Goblet of Fire is longer and more involved, but it's appropriate,  as Harry has just turned 14 and his life has become more involved. The  changes in the lives of Harry and his friends are addressed really well.  Though they are wizards and witches, they are young teenagers now, and deal  with the universal adolescent themes of flirting and appearance. However,  this book has not turned the series into a series of romance novels by any  stretch of the imagination! There's still more to be discovered at  Hogwarts, and more evil to be fought. As Harry grows older and more  complex, so does his battle with evil and his search for the truth. It can  only get more interesting from here.	2000-07-09

However, all my fears were for naught as I can honestly say that I think this is the best Harry  Potter book yet.  I could not put it down.  I don't know how J.K. Rowling  can come up with these stories, but they continue to have a richer plot  than any other book I have read.  <br />What makes THE GOBLET OF FIRE better  than the first three?  Well, I found that, not only is the plot deeper, but  Rowling also has advanced in her ability to express the situations and  emotions that accompany her characters.  She nails the personality shifts  of her characters perfectly, and they seem to float off the page and act  out the story in front of you.  It is as if she has experienced the story  personally and is just describing what it was like. <br />The ending of this  book is incredible, I don't think I breathed during the last hundred and  fifty pages.  If any kids out there are intimidated by the size of this  novel, don't be.  It is well worth the effort.	2000-07-09

It tells the story of the world famous wizard Harry Potter.  Harry was orphaned when he was one year old by the most evil wizard of all times.  When the wizard tries to kill Harry, the spell bounces off of Harry and redoubles on the  dark wizard.  Harry grows up with his aunt and uncle, who  &quot;forget&quot; to tell Harry what really killed his parents. In book  one Harry is taken to the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry where  he is trained in becoming a wizard.  For those of you that don't approve  of books about magic, the book is incredibly light-hearted and humorous.  Magic just makes the humor in the book more funny.  I mean, how often are  you verbally insulted by your mirror?  This book has the same touch of  style as all the other books.  There is an increadible amount of humor that  makes you want to come back for more.  The book plays as humor, fantacy,  mystery, and adventure.  This book apeals to most everybody.  Harry  lives a normal life with a twist.  He has to get along whith his evil  cousin, finish homework, keep out of the way of various ghosts haunting his  school, keep away from a killer wizard, and avoid being turned into a  canary by enchanted desserts his trick-playing friends provide.

So, I set to my task, and I did finish it at 8 O'Clock. But. I found it rather  dissapointing. There was a lack of depth in the characters, the depth that  had been there before. The plot was good, but weak. It seemed too much like  all the others, &quot;Lord Voldemort is after Harry...&quot; again. As the  other plot's held me throughout the book, this one didn't. What did keep me  going, though, was the fact that I was going to find out who the Death  Eater's were.<br />However, JK Rowling does tell us more about Voldemort's  past, and even his family. She also explored how Harry's status can falter.  With that annoying news reporter, that is, who put's up all sorts of rumors  about Harry, and turns all his peers against him. (&quot;Potter  Stinks.&quot;) I enjoyed that because, it's obvious that not everyone can  like Harry. (Ex-cluding the Dark Wizards.)<br />I would give this book 2 1/2  stars, but, obviously, you can't do that on Amazon.com. (So I put three  instead.) So, do get the book, it is worth it, but just don't come to me  when you see it's not quite as good as the others. But never fear JK  Rowling, one semi-good book does not turn me away from Harry, I am still up  to reading the rest, as I'm sure the rest of you will be.	2000-07-09

The latest enstallment hasall the things that make people of all ages come back to these books again and again.  The story will be a disappointment for quidditch fans, though there is flying, and quidditch players, throughout the story. However, the tournament, which takes the place of quidditch matches, more than makes up for the lack of quidditch. The Triwizard Tournament is what this book revolves around, and it pleasingly fills the 700+ pages this book encompases.  This book does take a slightly darker turn, and it will probably get some flack over some of the darker issues (insanity, torture) it explores. However, in a fantasy series, there must always be some danger and evil, and these issues are dealt with in the same, expert manner, that Ms. Rowling has dealt with all other possibly objectionable themes in her books.  Overall, this book seems to continue the trend of a slightly more grown up attitude, both in its audience, and the manner in which it treats the characters. It is only fitting that as Harry and the gang grow up, so do the books.  Overall, well worth giving up a day, a week, a month, whatever to read this book!	2000-07-09

For those of you who can't get enough of Harry Potter, this book is absolutely perfect.  My only complaint about the series so far is simply not having enough to read, but the 734-page fourth book, Harry Potter and  the Goblet of Fire, solves that problem.  It has all the appeal of our  beloved three original books, with tons of new characters, exciting twists,  and more insights into Harry's past.  This book almost reads like a  mystery, as the reader is not completely filled in on present events, and  hints dropped along the way can be used to piece together what will happen  in the end.  Consider yourself warned: the only displeasing aspect of the  book is the somewhat dropoff ending.  The other books of the series end  with some kind of triumph on Harry's part, and you walk away knowing that  more problems may arise, but things are all right for the time being.

The fourth Harry Potter book is captivating from the first chapter, starting with Lord Voldemort at the Riddle House. Harry is suffering at the Dursleys when an unexpected invitation comes from Ron Weasley to see the  Quidditch Finals. The way there is filled with funny bits, including a  contribuation from Fred and George. When the event takes on an dark,  unexpected twist, the  action starts. From the very beginning, the suspence  mounts. What will Lord Voldemort do to Harry? Is anyone going to die? Who?  How? How is Rita Skeeter finding things out? The book is another great  example of Rowlings work. She keeps you on your toes, and adds twists that  make your predictions be the opposite of what happens. Little secrets  uncover bigger ones. You uncover small surprises, including what happened  to Neville Longbottom's parents that made him live with his Grandmother.  This is a fantastic book, my favorite yet.	2000-07-09

WARNING: DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ BOOK 4. IT GIVES SOME MAJOR SPOILERS!<br />In a change toward darkness from her first two novels, the fourth book in Rowling's Harry Potter series is a wonderful book, which not  only lives up to the legacy of her first three books but also lives beyond  it. From the beginning of his summer, things are strange. Harry has a  strange vision that makes his scar, a souvineir of the time he survived  Voldemort, hurt. Then, there are other strange things which happen,  cumulating to when Harry's name is chosen for the triwizard duel, even  though he didn't put his name in and he was underage. He then had to  accomplish three tasks, and the last was the hardest of all...for there, he  meets his greatest enemy, Voldemort.<br />This book is considerably darker  and more scary than the previous three. However, it is still an excellent  piece of literature. It leaves the reader (or at least me) crying from  Cedric's death to the very end. Buy a box of tissues and pick up this book  NOW!	2000-07-09

I read the first book because I liked the characters and enjoyed the plot. I don't have any more excuses for reading these books. I read a lot as a child and I would have enjoyed  these stories much more then. Yet, the series is good enough that it  continues to hold my interest. The writing is predictable now, but the  story still remains a surprise and there was only one event in #4, HP and  the goblet of fire, which I had predicted. So, overall, I was very pleased  with the book and think it is great if these stories hold the interest of  any children. I heard the story would be much darker than the others and  that was not  true. However, the end of the story suggests why future  books may be darker. But, cleary Rowling is writing to delight, not to  scare.	2000-07-09

In this book, it is Year 4 at Hogwarts,  and the event of the year is the huge wizarding tournament being hosted by  Hogwarts between it and two of its rival wizarding schools, the first such  competition in over 100 years.  While each school is to have only one  representative, and that student must be 17 or older, somehow Harry is  entered as the FOURTH champion of the year-long event.  To top matters off,  it appears that Lord Voldemort is trying once again to rise and take his  place as the dark lord.  How did Harry get entered into the tournament?  What means will Voldemort use to exact his revenge?  Who does one trust?  All told, this latest book of Rowling's is more of a mystery and less of a  fantasy than her previous Potter books.  She admirably manages to convey  the growing maturity of Harry, Ron and Hermione - you can believe that they  are 14 and not the 11 years olds started in the original book.  The double  meaning behind the new characters names is still there and it is fun to see  how the character will evolve to fit his/her name.  However, I found this  book to be far darker than the previous ones - I would not feel comfortable  giving it to a 9 year old to read.  The final climatic battle is intense  and disturbing.  Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the book for me  was that the ending was less of completion and more of a harbinger of what  is to come in the next book.  While each of the previous books did hint  about what to expect in the next, each had a very satisfying conclusion.  It is clear that we are being prepared for a grand final battle between  good and evil.  And who is serving on which side has yet to be determined.  On the positive side, I enjoyed the numerous plot twists, and I found this  book was able to draw me in completely. I could not put it down until I  finished.  Considering the 700+ pages, that is quite an accomplishment.  I  would recommend reading this book, but only to a slightly older audience -  no one under 11 please.t down until I  finished.

She has made a book that is so exciting, and so sad (and so big) that it kept me reading for 10 straight hours.  For those of you that want to know the full story this is not the review to  read.  I will give no spoilers.  Harry potter and the Goblet of Fire  is to the first three Harry Potter books as The Lord of the Rings is to the  hobbit.  While the first three books are excellent they are really just a  set up to introduce the world  of Harry.  The Goblet of Fire is Rowlings  first Masterpeice in my opinion.  The Goblet of Fire has to do with  The Triwizard Tournament where Hogwarts and two other wizard schools,  Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, compete for the Triwizard Cup.  Voldemort  (sorry) and his supporters play a much bigger role in this book than any of  the others.  Overall this book has a darker feeling to it.  To put some  questions out of your mind.  1. Someone does die in this book. 2. There  are dragons involved in this book 3. There is a quidditch world cup in this  book. 4. Harry does have a major crush on Cho in this book.<br />  If this  book is any indication of what is to come from Rowlings There are at least  three books to look forward to.

This character development is truly  impressive, and the Author is a credit to her craft.

IN the other books around the 7th or 8th chapter Harry is probably at hogwarts with he new term.  Well in this book he gets to Hogwarts in the 12th chapter because J.K Rowling has finally figured if the book is longer then she could put more details and awesome adventures in the book.  Belive me you got to buy this book.  It probably will be suitable for people in the 6th grade through adults because the vocabulary is more hard to understand and there is more gruesome events in this book.

Being an avid fan of the notorious Harry Potter books, I sat up most of yesterday devouring Our Hero's latest foray into the world of Muggles, magic, and mayhem. And to my delight, J.K. Rowling has once again outdone herself. The book is a gem: it's funny, it's sad, it's wonderful, it's (dare I type it?) magical.<br />Considering the enormous publicity surrounding the publication of this book, the fourth of an anticipated seven book series, I was a bit worried that the book might fall short of its incredible build-up. Never fear, though, because \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" is the best book of the series to date. True, its length may seem a bit off-putting, but it moves briskly and the plot doesn't get as tangled and bogged down as parts of the third book did.<br />The focus of the plot has shifted, too. No longer relegated to being mere character-establishing details, the friendship and increasingly tricky relationships between Hermione, Ron, and Harry have become central parts of the book. They and their Hogwarts classmates are growing up, and the tone of the book reflects this shift in its emphasis on interpersonal relationships that are given every bit as much weight in the story as the characters' usual hijinks.<br />Press reports were correct in stating that this book is the turning point in the series; the end of the novel sets the stage for the coming battle between good and evil, but does it without sacrificing some of the characters' more ambiguous motives and choices. And yes, a character does die- but never, I think, will the appeal of these terrific books. Brava, Ms. Rowling! Long live Harry Potter, the boy who lived!	2000-07-09

I think Harry Potter may well prove to be the fad diet of theNaughties: the moment I purchased &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet ofFire&quot; at Barnes &amp; Nobles' midnight party, petty habits like eating and sleeping were put on the back burner until the last page had been turned. It's well known by now that Rowling's prose draws you in (enchants you, if you will), and the fourth installment in the series is no exception. Never have I had the pleasure to read a series that has gotten *consistently better* with each sequel.. not until Harry Potter, that is. After staying up far too late last night, I stumbled out of bed and brought the newest book with me to the gym, drawing some interesting looks from the folks around me as I kept my eyes riveted to the pages instead of the treadmill readout. My only regret is that I couldn't continue to read it when I did my laps in the pool!  =) Rest assured, those who doubted, that Rowling has, once again, surpassed herself. Not since Roald Dahl have I enjoyed so-called &quot;children's books&quot; so immensely; Rowling's dark sense of humor and knack for the fantastic remind me of such classics as &quot;The Witches&quot; and &quot;Matilda,&quot; favorites of mine since I was a young'n. But curse the woman for writing so well -- it takes me one day to read the books, and a year for the next to come out! That's what rereading is for, though, I suppose.	2000-07-09

The difference between this book and the other Harry Potter books is that it started the story somewhere else instead of the Dursley's house.  Unlike those in the other books, this time Harry was to spend a part of his 14-year-old summer with the Weasleys.  But  it turned out not as good as Harry hoped.  In the book, he had come face to  face with the Dark lord again.  What's new, however, is that the Triwizard  Tournament was added to Harry's school life.  I think Harry in the forth  book was much wiser.  In the previous books, he just went right to the  problems without thinking what might happen to him.  But this time he  thought it over before taking any actions.  Knowing what his next task in  the Tournament might be, he went looking for spells that would help him.  We may say he was growing up and becoming mature.  Like those in the others  books, a lot of people still worry about Harry, especially the Weasleys.  The one more thing good about reading this 734-page book,is that the  stories are much clearer and more coherent.  I just couldn't put it down  while reading.  It always gets to the best part at the end of a chapter, so  that it makes you want to find out what happens next, and I did.  It took  me 6 hours to finish it.	2000-07-09

Until the fifth one comes out, I will be on the edge  of my seat, waiting with bated breath.  As for a bit more detail.  I will  not give away any plot, however tempting it may be.  Suffice it to say that  the entirety of the story is entrancing.  I spent 8 hours straight reading  it until I was done.  The last chapters are not so much an ending, but are,  as the title of the last chapter implies, a beginning.  It is as if Rowling  included a few chapters from the next book at the end of this one to make  sure that speculation about the next will spread until the fifth book's  release. Buy this book as soon as you can.  It will vanish instantly once  the people who finish it first tell others about it.  If you have not read  the others, go out and buy all four.  It's no use waiting until they come  out in paperback, that may never happen at the rate they will sell.  Don't  let a treasure like this pass you by.

Here I am thinking that the third book (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) is the best book in the series, when I discover Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is even better!  In  this book, the first chapter draws you in, because it includes Wormtail  (the rat/human also known as Scabbers/Peter Pettigrew) and the Riddles. The  following is contained in the first two pages so do not email me saying I  am revealing a crucial part of the plotline: I did not understand how Tom  Riddle could have been murdured with his parents in a Muggle village,  because didn't Tom (Marvolo) Riddle's father leave his mother because he  found  out his wife was a witch? And didn't Tom live in a Muggle orphanage  and grow up to be Lord Voldemort? This will be explained in the end.  Anyway, Harry  is invited to stay with the Weasleys for the rest of the  summer in order to go with them to the Qudditch World Cup (Ireland vs.  Bulgaria), and they stay at a campground with numerous other wizards who do  not have a clue as to what a real campsite looks like, and where a crowd of  death eaters (supporters of the Dark Lord) have gathered to bewitch some  Muggle owners of the campground. When Harry, Ron, and Hermionie are sent  into the woods by Mr. Weasley while the ministry representatives attempt to  calm everything down, a skull with the tounge of a snake appears-causing  screams of fear from the crowd watching the death eaters-for this is the  dark mark, the sign of Voldemort. By the way, the Dursleys allow Harry to  go due to the fact that Harry's godfather is an escaped murdurer. Harry  then travels with the Weasleys to King's Cross in a MUGGLE TAXI (humorous  thing). When they arrive at school, they meet their new Defense against the  dark arts teacher, &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody, who has a magical glass eye  and does not like Draco Malfoy. There is no Qudditch, due to the fact that  the Triwizard Tornament is being held this year, a tournament between 3  schools, Hogwarts, Beauxmont, an elite French school, and Dumstrund,a  school from Bulgaria known for its teachings of the Dark Arts.

To quote an advertisement I heard somewhere: &quot;you can't improve on perfection. But you can equal it.&quot; So it is with Harry Potter. It is surely the greatest series I've ever read, and number four, Harry Potter  and the Goblet of Fire, is well up to standards. It was brilliant, as were  the other three, and I've been dying to get my hands on it ever since I  finished H.P. and the prisoner of Azkaban. I find that the series is  maturing along with me, and it's great to be growing with Harry- I've also  just finished the fourth form, so I feel like I know him much better than  Nancy Drew, for example, who's been eighteen since my mother was reading  the books! I won't reveal the plot..

We raced to the window and spied it on our porch: the lusciously thick Harry Potter and the Goblet of  Fire. The Star Wars video was turned off. The computer game was abandoned.  The book I was reading was set aside. We all met in the living room, even  the cats. I read aloud, of course; no one was willing to go through the  agony of taking turns. They stared with hungry eyes as I read, junkies  getting their fix at last: my 8 year old daughter, my 10 year old son... my  44 year old husband. We read four chapters the first day.

First, this book starts out pretty slowly; Harry doesn't even arrive at Hogwarts until page 170.  Second, while we meet many new  characters, they are mostly one-dimensional.  Ms. Rowling also gave several  characters accents that I found distracting.  Third, most of the action in  this book takes place within the last 100 pages.  Harry and his friends  spend too much time worrying and planning and not enough time doing  anything.  That said, this book is definitely worth reading.  Like in the  first three books, there are all sorts of plot twists and surprises to make  things interesting.  This book is a little scarier than the others, and  everything is not resolved at the end. Instead, the reader is left hanging  and waiting for book five.	2000-07-09

But Rowling's fourth has done exactly that--the Goblet of  Fire is simultaneously fast-paced, packed with the trademark sly humor, and  sometimes excrutiatingly on the mark about the &quot;usual pangs of  adolescence&quot;.  It is darker than other Potter books, filled with more  implied responsibility--the storylines seem to be growing up with Harry.  One small complaint--very small--is that toward the end, the majority of  the writing is purely expository.  However, the length of the book (roughly  three times the size of the first book) is not a negative.  It's more of a  gift.  After hours of reading the book, all you can do is smile.	2000-07-09

As eagerly as we have all waited for this book, I was tempted to read it slowly, and savor it, but I couldn't.  Rowling continues the magic she has displayed in the first three novels, but this time on a larger scope.  You get the feeling from the very first chapter that she has cast her net a bit  wider this time, but her control over this magical world is still complete.  There are more characters than ever before, and a bigger view of the  wizarding world, but the tale still revolves, as ever, around Harry Potter.  He is growing up, braver, more sarcastic (his friend Ron is also far more  sarcastic - he probably picked it up from Fred and George) but still as  likable as ever.  All the rumors you've heard are true - it's scarier,  you see the Quiddich World Cup (Rowling may have taken the fan behavior  from English soccer matches!), Harry gets interested in girls (although a  G-rated interest), and someone dies.  No hints here, but when it happens it  will be nearly impossible not to feel great sadness at this event,  although, as Harry, you might have to wait until you can catch your breath  before it sinks in.  Rowling's new characters are all vivid creations,  even if some seem underused (there are promises some will be back) and many  romantic hints are given which I hope will be played out in future novels.  The mystery is more complex than that of the third book, and you never  know whom to trust.  The final confrontation is the most intense yet, and  leads to many intriguing possibilities for book five.  So, where is the  line, and where do I get in it?	2000-07-09

I *won't* summarize the plot here in my review--there are just too many  delights, shocks, and surprises that you should discover yourself. This is  by far the most involved, detailed, and most of all *dark* Harry Potter  novel--Harry's life becomes far more complicated, with friendship problems,  romantic difficulties, and far more deadly threats to his life and  happiness than ever before. But don't be put off: there's as much of the  usual fun, silliness, and delight to J.K. Rowling's wonderful writing that  definitely had me laughing out loud even in some of the darker moments.  Rowling has planned the general structure of her entire seven-book saga  beforehand, and it shows in the care and attention to details that pick up  plotlines and characters from previous books (Tom Riddle, Dobby the  House-Elf, Sirius Black) and take them in dramatic and exciting directions,  as well as adding innovative twists and startling new characters ranging  from the frightening to the humorous. As great as the first books were,  Book Four is more mature, more involved, and more personal. She has, with  this book, taken the Harry Potter saga halfway through its full  seven-volume story, and I found myself thinking of another favorite saga:  conceived as a single structure but broken into parts that captured the  imaginations and hearts of kids and adults around the world: The &quot;Star  Wars&quot; movies. And what is generally considered the best of all the  Star Wars movies?--the *middle* one, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot;  On the 20th anniversary of that, my favorite Star Wars movie, I sat and  read the new Harry Potter, halfway through Harry's saga, and was amazed at  how much it reminded me of &quot;Empire,&quot; not specifically in plot but  rather in theme. At the end of both &quot;Harry IV&quot; and  &quot;Empire,&quot; the villain has shown himself to be more powerful than  imagined, our heroes have suffered a serious blow, and dark, dark times are  coming. We know they'll triumph...but half the fun is accompanying them on  their adventures.

For the Quidditch fans among you there is a  Quidditch specatular at the beginning of the book, and for those of you who  love the mysterious plot twists and turns, prepare to be as baffled as ever  before. As usual the clues are all there, but I think it would take the  combined forces of Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes to  discover this book's particular evil-doer before the appointed  time.<br />However, on a more serious note, &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; is  darker than the previous books, not because of any scarier monsters (I  still tremble when I think of the Basilisk and those Spider creatures in  the last one) but because of the general tone of the book and the growth in  understanding of our young heroes and heroines. The full horror of the past  is revealed to our friends, and as maturing wizards and witches they begin  to take on the sorrow and the responsibility of adulthood in a world where  evil keeps us all on our guard.<br />Truly this book is the &quot;Empire  Strikes Back&quot; of the Potter series and as such it shows enormous  bravery and depth. Rarely do we see such creative genius, especially in the  world of children's literature where we mostly find questions answered and  fear assuaged when really those fears and those questions are what push us  all forward into thought, action and responsibilty.<br />A challenging,  thrilling, imaginative, thought-provoking book from one of the world's most  exciting living writers.ginative, thought-provoking book from one of the world's most  exciting living writers.	2000-07-09

But dark magic happenings after the tournament foreshadow events that turn Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts into  a time of suspicion and worry. Harry is unwittingly drawn into the  TriWizard Tournament and ultimately is competing for his life. As with  previous books in this series the plot moves fast and seamlessly. The story  is interspersed with touches of both true humor as well the occasional  instance of juvenile humor. Rowling's young characters grapple with issues  ranging from first crushes to the ethical treatment of other creatures. The  last 100 pages of the book are intense and disturbing. Parents may wish to  pre-read this book and provide guidance and reassurance to young fans as  Harry experiences true evil and its grim effects.  The ongoing theme of  good against evil is explored more fully than in the previous books. Harry  is beginning to learn some unpleasant realities about human nature. Harry  must cope with the idea that even those on the side of good may have  unpleasant character traits including moral weakness, lack of foresight,  cowardice, prejudice, and inaction simply to maintain the status quo. The  reader gains insights into the motives and history of many favorite  characters at Hogwarts, including Neville Longbottom, Hagrid, Professor  Snape, and Albus Dumbledore.

I was completely blown away by the time I reached the end of this book. I am an avid reader of  fantasy and sci-fi books.Although I am  sixteen and the Harry Potter books often were a bit below my reading level,  I have  enjoyed them immensely. However, this book seemed very different to  me than the previous ones. This book is much scarier and darker, since the  villians really take no prisoners, (well, one, you'll see) and the book  starts and ends with the deathes of protagonists. I knew at least one  character from a previous book was doomed to die from an interview I saw on  TV, but I was still not prepared.  The twist at the end (there is one in  all of the books) is the best so far, not so far-fetched as the one at the  end of book 3, but enough to astonish even me though I was searching for  clues the entire time. But there is one thing that I feel will turn off  many younger readers, that is because the villain achieves most of  his/her's goals. However, it just makes me want to read the next one even  more. Despite that this book is over 700 pages, I finished it in half the  time of the other ones, I couldn't put it down, (I bought it a 8 am this  morning and finished it at 2 pm).

I started reading around 9 A.M. the next morning and finished about 10:45 at night.  (Granted, I did take little lunch and  dinner breaks)  But it goes without saying I haven't read for 12 hours on  one book like this ever before.  Unbelievable~and that's the word that  comes to mind after finally finishing this book.  The book starts  with a scene at the Riddle house. (Remember, Voldemort is Tom Riddle) This  in itself was different because I have gotten  used to the books starting  at the Dursley's with Harry over the summer.  Harry is not actually even in  chapter one.  After this the book gets going a little more, though I  considered the first eight chapters to be only so-so.  For me, the book  really started feeling like a real Harry Potter book when Harry went back  to Hogwarts, in chapter 11.  At this point, the book really picks up the  pace and by now, you simply cannot put the book down!  I think that since  in so many ways this book was very different from her others, I liked when  Hogwarts started again because it was a chunk of &quot;normal&quot; HP  books for me to hold on to.  The book is very complex and obviously  well thought out, as always.  Interesting names like Karkaroff and  creatures called veela appear.  Harry, Hermione, and Ron have grown up a  little and are 14 now.  I couldn't tear myself away from the book, because  I definitely liked it.  However, the book was some scary parts near the  end, particularily the part where the person &quot;readers will care  about&quot; dies.  This part upset me because the book's reading level says  8-12 years old, yet some 8 and 9 year olds would be definitely scared by  some parts.  Lastly, about the person who does in this book: (I won't  tell who it was)  J.K. did a good job even with this, because she took a  character you would have just felt bad if you knew it was this person, yet  by the end of the story you felt absolutely terrible that this wonderful  person had been killed.  She managed to make it feel like a close friend  had died.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was definitely a  pivotal novel in this series.  And it was great..in a way most different  from other novels.  The intensity is high, and while some questions do get  answered, this book left me with many more questions than answers!  She  ends the book keeping the reader completely hooked for the next one.ry you felt absolutely terrible that this wonderful  person had been killed.

Although it was near 800 pages, the book was hard to put down for even a minute.  Rowlings has put out another book that children and adults will both enjoy and  share.  This time, as always, Harry Potter's adventure was very  entertaining and the Rowlings was able to include many sub-plots that were  equally interesting. The new book has only improved on the Potter series,  and though it may answer new questions about what Harry Potter can  accomplish as a wizard it also brings new mysteries to think about. Who are  his real friends?  Who is the enemy? Will he and his frinds escape once  again unharmed?  Will they ever find a Defense Against the Dark Arts  teacher?  Adults will enjoy this book, as they have the first three.  Children will enjoy the book as well, although sometimes I wonder if they  will become frightened at some themes, especially younger children with the  theme of death.  However, I do not find the book inappropriate in any  capacity, and even themes of death and hatred can be handled by young  children as long as thier parents supervise.  I recommend this book to  anyone with and imagination, and cannot wait until Book 5.	2000-07-09

Apart from the fact that her characters are magical, Rowling  portrays the teenage Harry, Ron and Hermione as real and flawed 'people'  that will appeal to their young readers.

I'm going to refrain from giving away any of the plot, but suffice it to say, the plot has just gotten thicker. Harry hasn't only matured, but  so has the story, carrying multi-plot lines, more intrigue, more mysteries,  and more suspects.<br />My first impression was that this book ceases to be a  children's book, but rather a tale for the many adult readers who have been  finding themselves enraptured with Rowlings writings. This is not to say of  course, that this book can't be read by children... it still has the ease  of verse and language which Potter fans have come to appreciate. Rather,  the story is engaging enough to please the more mature readers out  there.<br />This 700+ page tome, left me entralled. I could hardly put the  book down. And since finishing it, I have already reread several chapters  again just to catch as many details as I possibly could.<br />Rowling better  get cracking... there are going to be millions of fans anticipating the  next book, as this one leaves you wanting more and more. Potter's universe  is expanding and what a way for it to grow. Do not hesitate to buy this  book if you love a good story... but I recommend walking through the whole  series first.

You can't help thinking, &quot;Does it really need to be that long?&quot;  Second,  as Ms. Rowling told us it is very &quot;dark&quot;. Just for example the  book starts out with some one dying. Being how old I am, this does not  bother  me. But to a 6 year old child it might be very disturbing. Plus,  thats not what we expect from any Harry Potter book. At least I want a fun  and easy read that takes my mind to a magical world, not a book that has a  deep under-currant of death.  Third, there were those times that Harry just  had the answer handed to him. You wanted at least Hermione to figure it out  and then tell him.  But, I must say, it's Harry Potter.

But the brilliant J.K. Rowling has done it again- with a book,  that, in my opinion, is the best in the series so far.   In this book,  Harry sees the Quidditch World Cup, discovers girls, is entered in a sort  of spell duel, meets some new friends and foes, becomes farther and then  closer to his friend Ron, and once again has a brush with, well,  You-Know-Who.... but I won't give it all away.   After hungrily devouring  over 700 pages of glorious fiction in about 4 hours, I was left with a grin  on my face, a feeling of triumph for Harry, and a pang that told me the  book was over; and that, alas, I would have to wait a while for the  sequel...

Her villians are as evil as ever, but many &quot;good guys&quot; (particularly in the Ministry of Magic) are not as pearly white as they seemed.<br />This  book starts with Harry Potter spending the summer with his Aunt Petunia,  Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley Dursley.  The Weasleys invite him to the  World Quidditch Cup game, and strange and dangerous things start  happening.<br />Once again, Voldemort maneuvers to improve his tenuous grasp  on life and to defeat Harry -- and he has no qualms about who he'll kill to  gain his ends.<br />Harry, meanwhile, not only has to contend with classes,  competition, and girls; he finds that Ron and Hermione are not mere  sidekicks he can expect to support him unthinkingly.<br />Add the usual  Hogwarts faculty (including yet another Defence Against the Dark Arts  teacher), students from two other (!) schools of magic, and you have a tale  that propels you from page 1 to 734.	2000-07-09

At630 pages long, a childrens book is unusual, to say the least! So itis really a tribute to J.K.Rowling that she can hold our imaginations that long, for hold them she did. The book is about Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts, and Harry is trapped into being the school champion: competing in the Triwizard Tournament under-age, in which many wizards have died. What follows is another exciting sequel. There were some new characters: Rita Skeeter, Mad-eye Moody, and Winky the house-elf, among others. Widely known as the one where someone dies and Harry discovers girls, the death when it comes is hardly the terrible event that many were afraid of (although the book is more serious in tone than the others), and girls do not particularly feature: it is not at all soppy, and left me eagerly awaiting the sequel.	2000-07-08

Only that is was well worth the wait!  For all of you who have never read any of the Potter books (could there really be people who haven't read at least one?) think  of these books as a series of magical mysteries.<br />It's life as usual for  Harry at the beginning of the book, which has him spending yet another  dreadful summer with his hateful guardians, the Dursleys.  (Imagine Dudley  Dursley on a diet!  Try saying that 3 times fast...)  Things pick up when  Harry goes to the Quiddich World Cup with the Weasleys.  And life at  Hogwarts is as interesting (and occasionally dangerous) as always with it's  oddball assortment of students and professors.  Naturally, there is a new  Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (my but they do keep going through  them, don't they?)  Along the way, we will learn about other schools like  Hogwarts (it's about time!)  And a new villain - or should I say  villainess - is introduced. Someone who definately keeps Harry on his toes.  All the while Harry and his 2 best friends, Ron and Hermione, become  entangled with the mystery of The Goblet of Fire....<br />With characteristic  abandon, Rowling creates familiar  busy backdrop for Harry and friends as  she pushes him through a series of terrifying encounters, the usual  mischief and mayhem, new revelations (and, of course, rousing games of  Quidditch)<br />It's delightful to see how Rowling can stay true to the feel  of the previous books, and yet allow Harry and friends to mature (ex: As  the kids are officially teenagers now, hormones will kick in for Harry, Ron  and Hermione... but they all fall in love with the wrong people!  Harry  especially has some difficulties in this area.)<br />Be prepared: this is a  darker book than the first 3.  Some well known characters die -- one of  whom is well liked by readers.  The ending of the book is frightening  compaired to the previos books but is a necessary evil for Harry as the  older he gets, the more he learns about his past.  JK Rowling has stated  that each new book gets progressively darker so as to  tie in with the  overall plot.<br />As always she writes with a deft touch.  This deliciously  suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping and imaginative as the previous  books -- full of unexpected twists and turns.  A delight to be savored,  especially you are, like me, already awaiting the next one.older he gets, the more he learns about his past.

My one critisim:  Rowling does less with details and the day-to-day life of Hogwarts  students.  I guess this would become boring now that we're familiar with  the setting, but I found it hard to believe that an entire school year had  passed for Harry when I reached the end of the book.  Readers beware,  however: if you thought there was suspense after book 3, and a rush for  book 4, then book 5 is going to create a stampede.  The 4th installment  does to the Harry Potter Series what The Empire Strikes Back did to Star  Wars.  It presents a great triumph, yet this triumph is dimmed by grim  defeat.

I was able to get my hands on a copy of book 4, about two weeks ago, thanks to some people I know in the book business.Here are some of the reasons I did not like the book:1.  I thought book 4 lacked the imagination  of the previous books.2.  I felt the quality of content in book 4 was  poor.To me quality of content meansgiving your  readers your best effort.  A good example is book 1.  you felt you were there observing everything.  I  did not get this feeling from book 4.3. I felt the stickability factor was  very low.  To me stickability is the power to get you involved with a  character in the book.  Even tho the quality is very low, I like the fact  that this book will get kids to shut off their computers and other  electronic time killers encourage them to read the 700plus pages.  Please  remember to pass your copy of the book to your friends and loved ones or  donate it to your school library when your done with it.  Your library will  be able to share the book with students unable to buy the book.	2000-07-08

So far, I have counted six swear  words (all the same one, I think) which may not seem like much but for a  book being read by seven-year-olds ... it's more than I would have thought.<br />It seems that Rowling's jokes are getting fewer and father between, but  funnier.  For instance, the Malfoy/ferret scene, which I absolutely loved  and have read time after time after time ... after time ... also, I loved  the way Fred asked Angelina to go to the ball with him: &quot;Oy, Angelina!  D'ya wanna go to the ball with me?&quot;  I laughed out loud for almost a  whole minute.<br />Although the beginning was a little bit -- darker -- with  Frank and Wormtail, and Voldemort, I liked the new introdution.  And I  loved the ending sentence to the first chapter.  However, I do have yet to  finish the whole book; maybe when I do I will post another reveiw.<br />All in  all, so far I loved this book and am now eagerly awaiting the fifth one  (boy, I just inhale these things ...) so I would recommend it in general,  but it's darker than the ones before, a little scarier, and I would say it  isn't for anyone under, say, eight or nine.	2000-07-08

Okay, so I realize that it's a book for every year Harry is at Hogwarts, but it would have been nice if this one could have been split into two - it's just too long.<br />Don't get me wrong, it's still a very good book, but  I just don't see myself rushing to pick it up again any time soon, which I  do frequently with the other 3 in the series.  And that's really why this  is only 4 stars instead of 5.<br />Ignoring the length, how is the book?  Very  good: the characters all grow, their relationships become more complex, and  the world they live in becomes darker and deeper, just as it does in real  life.  We get a better look at the global world of wizards and witches  (although some of the accents are a little ridiculous) and there is a more  palpable sense of evil in this book.<br />Are there any complaints?  Sure, but  there's always going to be a few.  JK Rowling seems to be pandering to new  readers by explaining previous events ad nauseum, which means that there's  little point in buying the previous novels if you read Goblet of Fire  first.  And the death that was so well hyped...well, no spoilers, but I  imagine there will be a few shrugs from adults as to the victim.<br />To  finish, it's a great read (maybe not 12am to 6:15am great, but that's my  fault!) that would have benefited from tighter story telling.  And if  that's the only complaint, then it's worth your time and money.	2000-07-08

The latest in Harry Potter's magical adventures has definitelylived up to (and surpassed) its expectations.  Like its threepredecessors, it's a book that you just can't put down.  Although it is the longest Potter book yet at 752 pages, each page is packed with interesting and imaginative dialogue, characters, and situations.  In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry and his fellow-fourth years become more interested in romances that sometimes cause conflict. Harry's still wary of You-Know-Who, trying to be on guard at all times.  These worries are compounded when his scar begins to throb again and someone makes the \\"Dark Mark\\" with Harry's wand-the sign of Voldemort!  But once Harry gets back to Hogwarts, there's too many other things for Harry to concentrate on-the usual class load, Professor Snape's constant watch, and of course, his crush on a certain female Quidditch player...Then, there's the huge wizarding event that will take place at Hogwarts for the first time in years! Harry tries to stay out of the limelight, but is soon unwillingly and mysteriously thrown into the spotlight-and into perilous danger. And then, of course, are the hilarious antics of the Weasley twins, the adventures of Harry and his two best friends, Ron and Hermione, Neville Longbottom's klutzy catastrophes, the taunting from Harry's nemesis, Draco Malfoy, and the other reasons why J.K. Rowling's books are so successful.  The new characters that appear in Book 4 are just as crazy and unique as all of the others.  Some of the new characters come into play as Harry's view of the wizarding world expands and he and his friends meet wizards from other countries.  Like the other Harry Potters, ...Goblet of Fire is a must-read!	2000-07-08

As an avid reader since early childhood, I'm thrilled to see lots of  people--children particularly--finally getting excited about reading, and  certainly, this is a book worth getting excited about.  The characters, the  plot, the settings--all are extraordinarily richly drawn and thoroughly  engrossing.  What I find particularly appealing about this book is the  incredible emotional range which it covers.  From a near-slapstick scene  featuring the Weasleys and the Dursleys to the death of one central  character, the book covers a huge amount of ground, and does it with  remarkable credibility.

As always, Harry returns for another year at Hogwarts. Before that, he visits the Weasleys, who are always amusing, where they go to the Quidditch World Cup. At the match, more than a tournament takes place, with some dark  mishappinings on the camp grounds. The whole year is filled with new  characters, some friends &amp; some enemys. Two other schools visit  in-order to go to the Triwizard Tournament, there are some very intresting  personalities. At the Yule Christmas Ball, you will be VERY surprised, the  person Harry takes is probably NO ONE you would expect. The death of a  character is very dark but the person was NOT a major player. Voldemort  suddenly re-arrises from the dead and almost back to power with the help of  one only known as Wormtail. This year is NOTHING like the previous.

Like &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;  contains reminders that the wizarding world is dangerous, scary--and often  unfair, and that not everyone is playing for the same team--or is even  playing the same game. I did start to wonder, towards the end, how Harry  and his friends ever found time to do any actual work (well, besides  Hermione...) with all of their sneaking around the castle late at night.  The Dursleys are as vile as ever; the Weasley's as much fun, and in  general, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is like walking  into a roomful of old friends and spending hours (several, at 700+ pages)  catching up on what everyone's been doing.

Throughout  the 700 and some pages, Rowling brings us the characterization, suspense,  and humor that readers have come to expect, but with a darker tone than the  previous books.  New characters such as Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour open  up new windows into Rowling's world, and Rita Skeeter is a wonderful  commentary on the &quot;any length to get a story&quot; attitude of the  media.  The return of Sirius Black, and meeting Bill Weasley (the 'cool'  Weasley) were only some of the thrills that kept me up late last night.

EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS!  I think the threebefore &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; were fast-paced and quite simply,the best books I have ever read.  This new book is no exception.  The 734 pages make for more fantastic details, surprises, and more reading of this fabulous series.  A lot of new characters are introduced, as well as your favorite old ones and the excitement and mystery is still there, creating an atmosphere unequaled in book history.  There is a new idea, a tournament with other wizarding schools, which of course provides more ways for adventure for Harry and his pals.  The climax is startling and there are numerous surprise endings, like in all Harry Potter books.  Harry even starts to discover girls, and if you like Quidditch, the Quidditch World Cup chapter is smack around the start of the book.  I got this book at midnight at a bookstore, and started this morning.  Only taking a few shorts breaks, I read the afternoon away.  I could not put it down and just finished it.  Now I can't wait for the fifth one!  To all Harry Potter fans, buy the book. If you've never read Harry Potter, get out of your cave and buy this book, as to not miss the best series in the entire world.  I can't really give my real rating, because the largeness of the number would take up to much space.  Just do yourself the biggest favor possible and BUY &quot;HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE&quot;!	2000-07-08

And while maybe not the all-time best novels or  child literature pieces, hats off to the author and her publisher for the  interest in reading and books in general this is stirring around the world.<br />I don't care how commercialized or marketed it's been, these books are  bringing a whole new generation of young readers back to really enjoying  and anticipating reading their next book. Every child's freiend who might  not be a &quot;reader&quot; all of the sudden is hooked because *everyone*  is reading it.<br />I'm actually hearing kids sit around in groups and  actually having serious, enthusiastic conversations about the books  (outside of school yet!) This is a fantastic result, and far more important  than any criticism about the means that produced it.  Parents are reading  to kids again (or more), older kids are reading to their younger siblings,  and hopefully televisions and videos and video games around the world are  gathering a dust for a while.<br />Besides, the book is just a plain old good,  fun read!<br />I truly believe that this book will spark a wide-reaching  interest in reading, and any one child who continues on with more and more  books could become a great person who makes a difference in our  world.<br />Browse the rest of Amazon or your local store or library with your  children as soon as they finish this book and keep them interested in  reading!<br />Right now, encourage them to talk about the book, anything  about it, and listen and support them with their reading. This is so very  important. Let's not let the chance get go by...	2000-07-08

As a 16 year old, I'm amazed that I can still enjoy a &quot;childrens&quot; book.  It's an incredibly well written  book, much moreso than even that last three.  The characters are  reintroduced as old friends, which at this point in the series they are to  many of the readers.  My only grievance with the book is the fact that, at  least in some small part, the author is attempting to live up to her image  as a writer for both adults and children.  The writing is slightly more in  depth, descriptive, and mature. She even uses a swear in the first opening  pages.  As a 16 year old child, I have no problem with this and it  certainly does not impede the magnificent story,  but perhaps a younger  person may have a problem with that. I loved it.

Each installment in this series has been better than the last, and the fourth is no exception.  The same sympathetic characterization and gentle wit that have carried the previous episodes are present, but combined with  an increased portion of the moral seriousness and sense of danger that  marked the third volume.  The supporting cast is rich, and the plot is  astonishingly intricate for any novel, let alone &quot;children's&quot;  fiction.  Rowling makes it look effortless, and the pieces fall into place  with a perfect feeling of rightness.  This is a serious book, with grave  themes, but the lightness of the style, the understanding of what it's like  to be a kid, and the bouncy side plots keep it from feeling like a preachy  or weighty tome.  The Harry Potter series has been moving towards  increasing maturity as Harry grows towards his destiny, and here, in the  fourth volume, the true scope of Rowling's epic ambition for the series has  become clear.  Suffice to say it's a doozy, and the remaining three volumes  have been set up for some pretty exciting events.  This isn't just good  children's literature, this is literature that has instantly earned itself  classic status.  This book is worthy of the hype surrounding it.	2000-07-08

Younger children may find it very disturbing and scary, Rowling's  characters are begining to grow up and their lives are becoming filled with  more concerns than just who gets the best grades. The length of the book is  necessary in order for the story to be set up...she is very obviously  trying to set the stage for the next 3 books. Harry and his friends do not  always have an easy time of it...jealousy, death, evil, and social  consciousness are all subjects that they have to grow through in this book.  The tone of the book is very dark with many comedic helpings from Fred and  George, who are starting to think beyond Hogwarts, and to what they want to  do with their lives.  A lot of this book is about that, taking stock of the  present and looking to the future.

Although Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, did, unfortunately, follow the same general format (Dursleys, Weasleys, Hogwarts, angry Malfoy, rumors of evil, competitions, victory/defeat,  Dumbledore's explaination, the inevitable Hospital Wing Scene....etc.), I  was surprised by how interesting it was to read this book - after fear that  the hype would deaden the impact of finally enjoying the story -, how fun  it was to follow the newest suggestions of who Voldemort's most faithful  Death-Eater could be, how sad it was to discover the fates of Neville's  parents, and the shock of the death of, well, nevermind whom, and the  hillarity of Percy's pomposity and much else besides.  Though I appreciate  the growing complexity of these tales, I feel saddened to note that  Rowling's storytelling seems to have lost much of its playful quality, so  like that of Roald Dahl, that was quite apparent in, &quot;Mr and Mrs  Dursley, of Number Four, Privet Drive, were proud to say they were  perfectly normal, thank you very much&quot;.

Thankfully, J.K. Rowling plays a little with the by-now-familiar formula; instead of showing Harry's miserable summer with the Dursleys and launching right into  the schoolyear (with the overdone Hogwarts rituals), the author sends Harry  to a Quidditch tournament with the Weasleys.  I won't reveal any more about  the plot, except to mention that He-Who-Won't-Be-Named makes an appearance  (of course) and we get an intriguing villain who is introduced in a clever  first chapter.  As much fun as the HARRY POTTER books have been, I would  like to see Rowling break away from the confines of her storytelling  formula and really try for something different.  I've been getting a  strange case of deja vu over the previous three books, as though the fresh  ideas and storytelling inventions of the first tale have been recycled with  only minor variations.	2000-07-08

As avid fans of the first three Harry Potter books, it would seem tobe that we would be the last people to criticize the fourth one.

It's Saturday morning and oddly quiet on our tiny block.  This is the day my daughter and all her girlfriends have been awaiting.  A pack of them left squealing not long ago.  They'd come to compare their copies...some  arrived at the door from Amazon...some at the midnight party in the local  bookstore...some at the mall with parents still yawning. They've excitedly  discussed how many pages...how many chapters...what will become of this  character or that.  Now all have gone and are curled up in their homes,  silently gulping their treats.<br />I could not be happier that my girl and  her friends can get so worked up about a book.  A BOOK.<br />Thank you,  J.K. Rowling.	2000-07-08

Rowling, who has written all of the other books in the Harry Potter Series. I love Miss. Rowling's work, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a perfect example of how well she writes. With termanology like &quot;Quidditch&quot; and &quot;Muggles&quot; it's amazing how she creates a perfect imagry and description of the characters. This book has a wonderful plot. When Harry's name get's pulled out of the Goblet of Fire (A device that basicly is a holding pen for things, such as nametags, as used in the book) he gets overwhelmingly suspicious because he did not put his name in the goblet to compete in the Triwizard ournament, the event that was going to be held at Hogwarts, Harry's school. Harry must compete in different events such as a huge maze that is full of magical obstacles to diving into a frigid pond to rescue a person. All in all, I would highly recommend this book to anybody.	2000-07-08

But all worth it. It starts out once again with Harry and his horrible muggle relatives; you're quickly drawn in by the first sentence which  discusses the &quot;Riddle House.&quot; The length does become an issue in  several chapters into the book, but the writing style makes the long lines  of text bearable. Much of it can be attributed to full-length poems printed  in the book. Quidditch, a violently intriguing flying game, moves the story  along. Harry and his friends attend a Quidditch World Cup that takes on the  persona of a European soccer match. The event leaves Harry and Co. psyched  for their own mini-World Cup, the Tri-Wizard tournament. This section is  particularly interesting as we find that other wizarding schools exist. But  it isn't all fun and games. Rowling allowed readers to know beforehand that  someone would die in this installment; sadly, we will no longer enjoy the  company of...of course not. More of the same comes in the form of another  new teacher, new wizarding gizmos and more of Harry's irresistible charm --  which wins over a certain young lady and shoves him into the dating scene.  The story is more adult than child, but the wording manages to barely gloss  over some horribly frightening moments. It's more of the same, and then  it's some more.	2000-07-08

With all the hype surrounding this book, substance could bemeager and still be acceptable. However, this book is by far the bestof all. It's a little older, a little more sophisticated than the others, but it works wonderfully. The basis of the book is that the Triwizard tournament, which hasn't been held for one hundred years in now being held at Hogwarts.  Traditionally, three champions are picked from the three competing schools from a &quot;goblet of fire&quot;. Harry does not even enter, but the goblet sputters up his name. Thus the book truly begains. The champions undergo three &quot;tasks&quot;, such as getting past dragons, rescuing captives from merpeople, and finding their way out of an enchanted maze. I don't want to reveal too much, but I will say this: Snape had a former life...a twist I found very interesting. All in all, these books just keep getting better.	2000-07-08

The first three books in the Harry Potter series were awesome. I was obsessed with them so much, that I went online almost every day and talked about them. Stone and Azkaban were my favorites and chamber was OK. I  counted the days till the fourth book came out and what did I find? A book  worse than two. It lacks the action and mysteries found in books 1 and 2.  It looks more like an adult book than a kid's book to me. Not to mention,  it's longer than a lot of adult biographies!

He's made the cover of Time and he's  captured the heart of readers everywhere- and, for once, as &quot;Rolling  Stone&quot; said about A Confederacy of Dunces, everyone is right.  J.K.  Rowling's got a knack for effortlessly clean writing that is enviable.  In  this, the latest, the scenario doesn't skew in the least- Harry gets  himself into a load of difficulties and traumas, often inadvertently,  sometimes with the help of his ultimate nemesis, Voldemort.  Rowling sends  the reader into a labyrinth of twists and turns- this is easily the most  sprawling of the four thus far released, at a hefty 752 pages- and one  emerges, after another breathtaking ending sequence, with a far better  portrait of exactly who Harry Potter is.  To reveal any more would be to  reveal too much.  Suffice it to say- it's worth the hype.  And then some.	2000-07-08

It was suspenseful and dramatic, but it also had heart. I also love how Rowling continues to make the details count - there are  little details from the first three books that I didn't even think about  that became signifigant. Word of advice though - make sure that you have  read the first three books before starting this one. If you don't, you  won't understand as much as you should about the plot. The book draws very  heavily on the second and third books. I'm not going to say anymore,  because it's very important not to give details, since the suprises are  what makes the book special. However, suffice it to say that I am very,  very pleased, and I am not looking forward to waiting another year for the  next book!	2000-07-08

K. Rowling's writing - skills: humour, the charm of the unexpected, and blistering wit - all of it targeted 100% accurately  at her readership.<br />Her uncanny knack for picking up a storyline and  veering off in a totally unforeseen direction is as practised and her  writing as adept as ever.<br />You'd think that Harry and his friends might  deserve a bit of a rest from Voldemort - but they pick up their adventures  where they leave off. In the chilling introductory chapter it becomes  obvious that Voldemort's getting more evil and more threatening with every  book - and Harry has to get stronger to deal with him.<br />He's not left  alone to do so though - amid the excitement of the Quidditch World Cup, and  the following term at Hogwarts, he's bombarded with new people, new  experiences, and above all new monsters to deal with.<br />With her usual  light touch, J. K. Rowling takes Harry through one of the toughest of his  adventures - ending with a competition that leads him straight into  conflict with his deadliest enemy.<br />How he survives it with his friends'  help, and how he comes to terms with a death along the way, is moving,  exciting and often very funny.<br />This is probably the most complex of the  Harry Potter books, with a plot that's more serpentine than ever (but just  as logical). It carries you along with it as fast as before, and I found it  hard to put down until I'd finished it.<br />I'd say it was the best yet, in a  series that's one of the best I've read.
