A significant conributor to the meme that humans are a significant factor in global warming are the predictions of unverified climate models. Most of the media and psuedo scientists don't mention these sticky little details. Currently, these models all predict certain relationships between surface and tropospheric temperatures that are not validated by the observed data...even after the much publicized corrections to the data. I find it amusing that this guy uses global warming as an example of right wing preconceptualism when it is much more likely that it is an example of left wing preconceptualism.	2005-09-21

It consists of a few pages (&lt;10) per alleged conspiracy, most of which is vague, unverified, unfulfilling and, at best, slightly informative. Each section is a repackaging of prior speculations, which the authors do not investigate, and to which they add little insight.  <br /> <br />Some of it is outright discredited (e.g., the fictional invisible ship!) and some of it is outdated (e.g., the latest Roswell declassifications are not mentioned). <br /> <br />The authors method is to merely repeat others' comments regardless of whether they are reliable, and pass them off without chalenge. Hence, the book does not impart much real knowledge to the reader, even though it seems like it was meant to. <br /> <br />Also, there was little citation, and most of it is old. Looks like the authors did not update the 70 or 60 that were in the original. shoddy!	2005-09-02

Don't waste your money nor your time on this work.  If you want to read a real history of the life and times of Papa Pacelli, read Rabbi David G. Dalin's [[ASIN:0895260344 The Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII And His Secret War Against Nazi Germany]], written not by a failed Catholic, but by an observant Jew who became indignant at the soiling of Pope Pius XII's name, and who set out to set the record straight.    Consider the following before you dump your money into this travesty:    *A major response to Hitler's Pope came from University of Mississippi law professor Ronald J. Rychlak in his 2000 book on the subject, Hitler, the War, and the Pope. Rychlak was acknowledged by the Vatican to have been given special access to their closed archives for his research.[citation needed]    *Rychlak disagreed with Cornwell's claim of having found a \\"time bomb letter\\", arguing that the letter in question had actually been written not by Pacelli but by his assistant, and moreover had been fully published and discussed in a 1992 book by Emma Fattorini (a highly respected docent at the University of Rome).[18] With respect to Cornwell's allegations of antisemitism, Rychlak stated that \\"When Pius XII died in 1958, there were tributes from virtually every Jewish group around the world\\".    *Rychlak also alleged that Cornwell manipulated the photograph on the front cover of the American edition of the book, and incorrectly dated the photo as having been taken in March 1939, the month that Pacelli was made Pope. Rychlak charged that this had been deliberately in order to give the impression that Pius had just visited Hitler when, in fact, the photo had been taken in 1927 as Pius was leaving a reception held for German President Paul von Hindenburg.[21] Robert Royal has also repeated this allegation.    *In his 2005 book The Myth of Hitler's Pope, the historian and rabbi David G. Dalin countered Cornwell.[23] Dalin suggested that Yad Vashem should honor Pope Pius XII as a \\"Righteous Gentile,\\" concluding that \\"[t]he anti-papal polemics of ex-seminarians like Garry Wills and John Cornwell...of ex-priests like James Carroll, and or other lapsed or angry liberal Catholics exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today.\\" Dalin called the book's conclusions \\"unverified\\" and \\"strongly anti-religious\\".[25] Eugene Fisher, who has a PhD in Hebrew culture and education, said it was a \\"sad commentary on the secular media that this anti-Catholic screed was ever published\\".    *In the book The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, Philip Jenkins said that Hitler's Pope, along with anti-Catholic conspiracy theories and other \\"anti-Church historical polemic\\", belongs to the pseudohistory category of books about anti-Catholic \\"mythic history\\", historical manipulation, and national demonization, such as the Black Legend about Spain, said that publishers publish such books because the sell many copies, not because they mean to \\"destroy or calumniate Catholicism\\".    *Ken Woodward, writing in Newsweek, stated that Hitler's Pope has \\"errors of fact and ignorance of context [that] appear on almost every page.\\"    Source: [...] - Check the footnotes to read the primary sources.	2005-07-31

This'll save you money over the trade cloth one. <br />Should your county public library system allow you to RESERVE a <br />copy of either binding (soft/hard), then find out how to do so; <br />ask the professionally-trained Librarian (not the checkout clerk) <br />(print the Amazon page and take it with you to ease the process). <br />3. <br />Having encouraged you to get a copy of this timely book, I hasten <br />to call your attention to what has been said regarding the CAUSE <br />of the various forms of cancer throughout the 'civilized' world, <br />as stated by an avatar in India (1926-20XX), Sathya Sai Baba of <br />Puttaparthi (now at Prasanthi Nilayam, AP 515 134, India). Why a <br />westerner shopping on amazon.com should consider a living avatar <br />vis-a-vis the #1 cause of cancer? Because by having a divine view <br />of mundane matters (debatable premise, admittedly: sathyasai.org) <br />He can point out from His perspective aspects which we would not <br />consider to be important. In this case, it is the BONES that stay <br />within the refined sugar after the process of chemically removing <br />'impurities' from raw cane (or beet?) that are the number 1 cause <br />of cancer. He mentions that tobacco and poluution come a distant <br />second in being causative agents. The bone particles are present <br />even in so-called brown or turbinado sugar, which is white with <br />some molasses added back. He suggests the alternative JAGGERY to <br />sweeten meals without the refined sugars. There's one point which <br />He typically inserts as a test of backbone: one must decide if a <br />sweet tooth is more important than one's long-term health. I add <br />myself that we can exist without factory sugar (uncivilized folks <br />got along fine without it before white sugar became essential), & <br />sugar supposedly FEEDS cancer cells that seemingly exist (double <br />whammy), whereas OXYGEN supposedly kills cancer cells. Forgive me <br />for throwing in those last two unverified tidbits; nevertheless, <br />since they seem to directly affect cancer cells (feed/kill), and <br />since most folks CAN take control over how much sugar and oxygen <br />enters their system, it seems to me to be worthwhile to tell you. <br /> <br />I regret the say that I haven't the citation from Baba; he stated <br />the connection between cancer and (refined) sugar in 1981, and it <br />appeared in a (very difficult to find online!) 'Summer Showers'. <br />What astonishes me is that devotees of Sai Baba commonly KNOW of <br />this cause-and-effect, yet nothing is being done to spread word.	2005-07-23

Dawn goes into how we got into the current cultural mess in our society, though given the book's age it is a bit dated as it refers primarily to \\"Boomers\\" (from what I've gathered in other research, the situation is similar for GenX, just worse).  She then critiques the well meaning (I hope) attempts to reach America's dumbed down, short attention span, commitment phobic generation with worship styles that would be attractive to them, no matter the cost to the Gospel.    Dawn critiques not only contemporary worship but traditionalISM as well. She sees the function of worship (quite correctly, I might add) not as means of attracting numbers (AKA \\"worship evangelism\\"), but of having a personal experience with part of God, forming the character of the worshiper, and building community. Both extremes are the antithesis of this.    I have two minor criticisms of this book. Dawn, who I guess has no training in science or technology, tends to present as scientific fact the results of single research studies which appear to be unverified by independent work (to be fair, some are unlikely to be reproduced anytime soon) and might not have had significant peer review. Second she, unlike Long, is a little vague when it comes to solutions, though they seem to be there somewhere. In other words, she can ramble a bit.	2005-07-16

No one hired this person to write this book, gave an advance or request and she has paid to have it published.  No one edited it nor verified any of her information is accurate and non-libelous.  I doubt anyone would sue a vanity press author for libel as it is well known that there is little money to be made in this kind of endeavor.

Looking at the comic book cover, the sensationalistic back jacket, and cover to cover of unverified accusations, this book was tailor-made for conspiracy buffs. For example, they want you to believe that 15 years ago microchips were being injected into the bloodstream to reach the brain for the purpose of mind control. Never mind that 15 years ago wafer fabs capable of manufacturing such chips don't, and still do not, exist - oh, that's right, the government is covering them up! <br /> <br />This book has examples of criminals who, when arrested, claimed that the government was injecting voices in their heads. What the author seems to have left out is that claiming to hear voices is the first step in a defendant's PRETENSE of an insanity defense! Yeah, this author leaves a lot out. <br /> <br />But never mind, the facts make no difference to conspiricy fanatics, do they? <br /> <br />Stay away from this book unless you like it piled high and really smelly. <br />	2005-06-18

I started it preparing myself for a hatchet job, but found, slightly to my disappointment, much that was well-balanced and reasonable. <br />The first chapters contained unverified statements about child psychology.such as \\"overprotected kids do not flourish.\\" I'll leave the dodgeball issue to NASPE members. <br />The accounts of Maslow and Carl Rogers and the encounter therapies of the sixties flog some dead horses (Maslow died in 1970 and Carl Rogers in1987). <br />Chapter 3, from Sin to Syndrome, hits some easy targets in examples of psychiatric defenses in criminal cases, but is rather superficial. I'd agree with what they say about the management of pedophiles. I think they shortchange the possibility of abnormal brain chemistry leading to addiction, but they talk excellent sense about the brain imaging studies.  <br />Chapter four contains a useful summary of what is know about the course and therapy of bereavement.  I'd recommend it to any student who doesn't have time to read Zisook  (\\"Biopsychosocial Aspects of Bereavement\\") or Parkes.  The discussion of PTSD and its treatment is well informed and helpful. The evidence about support groups for medical illnesses is dealt with fairly. Perhaps it's an unfair shot but, after looking at the jacket photographs, one rather wonders about the authors' credentials for pontificating about combat veterans.  <br /> Chapter five deals with the emergency psychotherapeutic response to disaster in scathing and nihilistic terms that are probably well justified but become repetitious after having made the well-worn observation that the usefulness of debriefing is questionable. <br />I didn't find it highly readable.  Maybe that's because it's not polemical and biased enough. It's largely made up of summaries of other people's writings and some of the best bits are quotations from others, such as the man offered bereavement counseling after the death of his 105 year old aunt. <br />	2005-05-06
US	36575532	R611BT3GW4NZ0	1932360220	204732536	Wake Up, You're Liberal!: How We Can Take America Back from the Right	Books	3	8	22	N	N	Ted Rall:crazy left-wing loon or not?	If you're sick of people who just post partisan attacks or commentaries withouth actually mentioning anything relating to the book (which is 80% of the reviews for this book) then read on.  <br /> <br />After reading several of Ted Rall's columns and seeing him on tv, there was not one thing that he said that I had agreed with. However, after reading this book, he is suprisingly rational on some issues including immigration and  <br /> <br />abortion.  Overall, this book was a lot more interesting and thought-provoking than most of the usual liberal tripe by people like Al Franken, David Corn, or David Brock.  THe main reason is because it actually talks about what Rall  <br /> <br />thinks should be done (regardless of how crazy some of the ideas are) and only spends 1 chapter complaining about Republicans and how they're evil, etc.  The usual best selling political book from liberals these days is all about Bush/ <br />Republicans and lying, etc.  Rall has finally figured out that people are sick of these attack books and might rather instead hear what liberals stand for.   <br /> <br />So here goes. Rall's writing is very easy to follow although his tone is a bit crude at times.  The only problem I had is that he doesn't use footnotes or sources in the text.  All the sources are listed by topic at the end leaving you to go  <br />hunting for the validity of any claims made in the book.  There are several chapters which are repeats of each other but I guess some people never get tired of the term \\"neo-fascists\\".  Just like any liberal book, completely unverified conspiracy theories are mentioned (Bush had his underage girlfriend  <br />get an abortion in 1971 when it was still illegal,  Bush officials invaded Afghanistan because of the oil and gas pipeline, Al Gore actually won Florida by 46,000 votes), so don't fret if you're a kool-aid drinker.  Overall, he does  <br />manage to stay pretty close to ideas and issues instead of personal attacks though.   <br /> <br />Some of the things which Rall has suggested that I agreed with included \\"Education cirriculum should be nationalized\\", \\"affirmative action is  <br />indistinguishable from quotas\\" and that affirmative action should be eliminated or based on class (not race),  \\"from a biological standpoint, abortion is the killing of an unborn baby\\" (we differ here in that I think this killing is not  <br />justifiable whereas Rall believes it is), \\"Americans seeking to cast votes should answer a few simple questions\\", and \\"The US should admit more legal and fewer illegal immigrants\\".  I agree totally with all these ideas.  What is suprising is that they are all in stark contrast to basic Democratic/liberal  <br />principles.   <br /> <br />Now there are plenty of things which Rall says that are completely crazy.  He of course wants major economic changes all moving us more towards socialism (\\"wealthy individuals and businesses should be taxed nearly to death\\").  Also he  <br />says Judges should decide punishments instead of mandatory sentencing laws (the whole reason of which was to take out the subjectivity of sentences between judges), we need to convince other countries that hate us not to hate us, the environment is the most important priority, and that Democrats need to be  <br />completely ruthless and shameless in fighting the Republicans.  This is one of the main themes  of the book on which I think Rall is completely wrong.  He says that Republicans win because they are underhanded and they fight so much harder and dishonestly than Democrats.  I believe that the reason people aren't voting for Democrats (and most of the ideas he suggests) is because the majority of the people in this country don't agree with them (esp the ones I mentioned above).   <br /> <br />If you're looking for something that is interesting and not the same \\"Bush lied, Bush sucks, Republicans are mean, evil, Nazi's\\" liberal book go read this book.  Regardless of whether you agree or disagree withRall at least he has the intelligence to put forth ideas and try to explain them and why they will work/win.	2005-03-05
US	50697552	RFXIBHDE8ZMQI	0140143599	693084256	Cantor's Dilemma: A Novel	Books	2	5	10	N	N	a over simplification of reality	This little book (Cantor's dilemma) came to my attention ironically not because of its well celebrated English version, but because of the new Chinese translation, which bore a new name (The prisoner of the Nobel Prize). Anyway, I spent a whole evening enthusiastically (at the beginning) perusing it (the English version), but was left with more or less joy. <br />Many people in Amazon.com have praised this little book presumably without any reservation. I would also first congratulate the author's great effort to write a novel on scientific ethics, and in particular for the psychoanalysis of scientists. However, in terms of literature and science, I would say this book is not worth much attentions. <br />The plot in this novel is too simple. A serious professor had a brilliant idea (which is flawed based on biology, by the way), two worked experiments (probably), and the Nobel prize, but suffered by unverified experiments due to suspicious manipulations of his postdoc. It surprised me that he won the prize within a year. This oversimplified the reality. If the professor didn't publish his experiment details and furthermore the experiments couldn't be replicated in other labs (officially), it is impossible to get the Nobel prize, let alone within a year. It would be better that the professor didn't get the Nobel prize and was constantly suffered from unverified experiments, rumors of data fabrication, and science politics. The deft handling of these crisis is more interesting for future academic seekers.  <br />One of the key components in this book is about research ethics. We have heard many rumors about research ethics. This book talked about a similar situation occurred in the Noble Laurel David Baltimore's lab, in which a postdoc was involved some manipulations of data. I like the author's way of presentation: hinted but never gave a definite answer whether the postdoc did something wrong with the experiment or not.  <br />In terms of science ethics, I would like recommend people reviewing one of the most horrible studies in modern history: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. This study was initiated by the United States Public Health Service, together with the Tuskegee Institute in 1932. The study recruited 399 black men diagnosed with syphilis in Macon County, Alabama to determine the effects of untreated syphilis. The study would last until 1970, way after the discovery of penicillin in 1943, which is the most effective drug to treat syphilis. Unfortunately, these black men, with the highest education at 7th grade, were only treated by aspirin and an iron supplement. It was till mass media caught this horror that halted this experiments. By then, many had died of complications of syphilis.  <br />Although the book spent quite some length talking about trust, responsibility, authorship , lab rules, and in particular the peer pressure and jealousy, advisor seeking, tenure system, and gender discrimination, the author barely scratched the surface of publishing process, grant application and management, and other important research activities. It is possible that the author thought his intended readers are most likely undergraduates or beginning graduates. However, beginning graduates are eager to know how these research activities are like so that they can decide whether they want to seek academic jobs or not. Most time advisors are reluctant to talk about these issues with new graduate students. <br />The author also devoted some pages on sex, especially on teacher-student type of sex. I am not sure why he blended sex in this book but it did add some vintages in it. The depicting of female scholars in this novel is too optimistic. That a fresh female chemistry PhD can get an assistant professorship in Harvard, Cal tech, and Wisconsin is amazing, if not shocking.  <br />In terms of writing skills, the author seemed to have adopted a film making style. However, sometimes background events cut into flow of story too abruptly.Furthermore, the author lacked the ability to write juicy words when he was describing romantic events. His view of sex and romance was also old fashioned. <br />I think the ending is the worst part of this novel. As we all know, academic people are good at insinuating things. A famous professor will never write a blunt insulting letter to another professor. I guess the author tried to give solutions to all problems left in the novel instead of giving some hints. This reflects his lack of confidence to his readers, which are at least college students ( I doubt a not prepared high school student can understand many concepts discussed in his book). <br />In summary, if you don't know much about scientists, this book will give you a good kick start. If you are a graduate student who talk with your advisors very often, this book may be too simple to you. If you are a seasoned researcher, it is probably wiser to use your time on other amusements.	2005-01-12
