US	52849014	R2RM7NN38BSHN1	0940895072	365246507	Selling Satan: The Evangelical Media and the Mike Warnke Scandal	Books	5	29	31	N	N	Good Reading and Well-Researched	Unlike many of the reviews that I've read for this book, I read this book with an open mind. Even more than that, having personally been a Mike Warnke fan many years ago, I had noticed on my own that his stories do not line up. With that in mind, I sat down and sketched out many of the simple facts that do not add up. I encourage anyone with an interest in Mike Warnke to step past their own emotional responses and actually study Mike Warnke's words.<br /><br />For example, if you were to listen to all Mike Warnke's concert recordings and keep a journal of everything he claims, and then compare the notes from the individual recordings and the Satan Seller, you will quickly realize on your own that Mike's portrayal of his own life just is not possible. His story of his own life changes too greatly over time. Additionally, the timeline of events as Mike describes cannot be accomplished on a calendar. Although some errors can be attributed to the passage of time and the possibility that a fact or two can be misplaced, the staggering number of incongruities that occur in Mike's own words are just too many to be shrugged off. After amassing such list of apparent mistakes on your own as I have suggested, sit down and read this book. You will see that not only does your list make sense and Mike's life does not, but you will be able to fill in many of the causations and backgrounds for the inconsistencies.<br /><br />I find it amusing, however, that the people who are accusing the writers of this book of dishonesty are also stooping to name-calling, and at the same time degrading the book's authors and promoters as name-callers. That's like saying, \\"Stop calling me names, you pooh-pooh head!\\" I understand that there are a great number of people that loved Mike's public image in the past, and several people still do. This causes an emotional reaction to the truth, and that makes it almost impossible for some people to take. For example, most people have been around the Internet long enough at this point to have seen an Urban Legend or two. When you point out that someone has forwarded you an Urban Legend, there is an underlying realization by the sender that they have just been fooled. They become embarrassed, defensive, and sometimes deny the truth by trying to back up the story with allegations that the story was verified by other sources. There comes a time when you have to put aside your emotional reaction to a situation and just analyze the facts.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that one of the reviewers seems to base his assertion for Mike's innocence on a personal conversation that he had with Mike. Although I am not 100% sure, I feel that most people would be easily subdued by Mike if they spent an afternoon with him. That's part of Mike's recipe for success - his charisma is unmistakable. Like a skilled artist, Mike knows how to make you see \\"his\\" side of the story, regardless of any basis in fact.<br /><br />That being said, the accusation that Christians \\"shoot their wounded\\" is all-too-often true. If Mike had come forth and openly admitted that he had lied, asked forgiveness from those that he had offended, and the church still treated him as an outcast, then the church would be guilty of such a crime. But with Mike Warnke, the reverse is more the case. Mike has wronged a great number of people, and yet he still maintains his innocence and claims to be the victim. (The closest that Mike has come to admitting any wrong-doing on his part was to assert that he had exaggerated slightly.)<br /><br />From having studied human behavior, there is an explanation to Mike's actions. Mike's stories and defenses seem to put him more in the category of a Pathological Liar and not a Compulsive Liar. For those of you that have never met a Pathological Liar, they are interesting people to know. Compulsive Liars simply tell lies for personal gain or self-preservation. They are aware that they are lying, but they can justify their behavior patterns to themselves. (This behavior is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.) Pathological Liars, on the other hand, tell lies for a myriad of reasons, but believe their lies as deeply as we believe the truth. Therefore, they can defend their lies with a zeal that parallels the defense of truth. Having personally known a few Pathological Liars in my lifetime, it is frequently hard to distinguish their truths from their lies. Because of this predisposition to dishonesty, Pathological Liars often lose the trust of everyone around. And unless they make an attempt to regain trust, they may never be trusted again. Mike Warnke's conduct suggests that he is not concerned with regaining trust, because he continues to assert that he never lied, even when faced with insurmountable evidence to the contrary. Because of this, Mike's behavior can only be categorized as unrepentant.<br /><br />This leaves us with a few questions and answers:<br /><br />Should the church reject Mike Warnke? Absolutely not.<br />Should Mike Warnke be forgiven? Yes.<br />Should Mike Warnke repent? Yes.<br />If Mike does not repent, should he still be forgiven? Yes.<br /><br />But the most important question: If Mike does not repent, and we have forgiven him as the Bible instructs, should he still be trusted?<br /><br />That answer, I'm afraid, is NO.r is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.)

Though I certainly do not agree with everything Commander Rockwell wrote, many of his observations and conclusions, though dated by time, still appear to be valid even today.<br /><br />His concerns about the power and influence of organized and entrenched Zionism and the dangers implicit in this power and influence ring bitterly true after events such as 9/11 and the invasion of Afganistan and Iraq where American foreign policy has been increasingly hijacked by pro-Israel 'neocons'.  In addition, his warnings about the violence and degeneracy of African-American culture and behaviour can be verified by simply turning on your radio and listening to the savagery, sexuality and baseness of so-called 'rap' and 'hiphop' music as well as by examining the barbarity and sexual promiscuity still found in the inner cities of Detroit, Washington, Los Angeles and New York.<br /><br />The genius of Commander Rockwell, who gave his life for his cause and his people, is clearly evident in his warnings and prognostications for the America of the future.  Enlightened citizens should surely take them to heart.	2005-10-12

Some very powerful conversions happened as a result of the strength of his faith. <br /> <br />I have heard about laughing revivals, listened to people speaking in tongues or passing messages on in church straight from God and watched people fallover when touched by certain preachers. In my opinion the above is all weak testimony of what the Lord is doing.   <br /> <br />Yun shows what the Lord is really doing by receiving meaningful visions and miracles which bring about change and can be verified by those where the event occurred.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-11
US	36037231	R22PZ6WIMWZJ9W	0907871321	875389183	Hermit of Peking: The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse (History and Politics)	Books	4	19	20	N	N	Interesting reading about of Peking's characters, supplements "Dragon Lady"	Sir Edmund Backhouse (1873-1944), up until this book was first published in 1976, was renown as a great scholar of sinology.  In conjunction with the British journalist and former Times correspondent J.O.P Bland, he had authored two best selling books about the Chinese Royal Court at the Forbidden City, Peking (now Beijing).  Backhouse, by the time of his death, had lived in China for nearly 40 years.  The high esteem in which he had been held by students and scholars of Chinese history collapsed upon publication of this book by Hugh Trevor-Roper (HTR).  Trevor-Roper of course is the esteemed British historian and author of the classic \\"The Last Days of Hitler\\".  The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" is the first full biography of one of history's greatest scam artists, Sir Edmund Backhouse.  The pinnacle of Backhouse's achievements, the publication of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" in 1910, was found to be based on a forgery, one of many forgeries as it transpires, perpetuated by Backhouse, the ramifications of which continue to this day. <br /> <br />I first read of Backhouse in Diana Preston's book \\"The Boxer Rebellion\\", (a modern account of the siege of the Peking legations in 1900 by the Chinese Boxers) and again in Sterling Seagrave's \\"Dragon Lady\\", a revisionist biography of Tzu His, the Dowager Empress.  Both authors are not charitable about Backhouse, and both give a potted biography of the man, particularly in Seagrave's book.  In fact, Seagrave is particularly scathing and rightly so.  As a direct consequence of Backhouse's forgery of a diary supposedly by a high Manchu court official, and subsequent book publications based upon the diary, popular history regards the Dowager Empress as an evil, scheming, and manipulative woman, who went as far as having her own son murdered to maintain her grip on the regency of China.   <br /> <br />The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" gives a much fuller account of the life of Backhouse, and fills in more detail about the numerous frauds that Backhouse tried pull off.  Not only was Bland as co-author of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" a victim (Bland believed until his death that the diary could not have been a forgery) of Backhouse's fraudulent activities, but also G. Morrison, the renown Times Correspondent.  Even Oxford University and the British Government were taken in as HTR gleefully relates.  It is amazing that Backhouse got away with what he did without the greater world being aware of it, but HTR shows the reader how he did so (Backhouse's victim's embarrassment was one reason).  In part, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a detective story as HTR pulls the threads of this tale together, sorts fact from the many fictions.  It is well written, and only in the final chapters does HTR delve into the literary pornography for which Backhouse is now famous for, and HTR does so with taste, sparing the reader the graphic details (Seagrave doesn't spare though).  Trevor-Roper relied on a number of sources, which in the main is the private correspondence of Bland and Morrison.  The author also had access to the archives of the Foreign Office and of one of Backhouse's former employers.  And of course, HTR uses Backhouse's own writings to point out historical contradictions and fabrications which can be verified with certainty.    <br /> <br />If there is a quibble with the book, it is that HTR doesn't dwell on the historical consequences of Backhouse's frauds and how it contributes to a long and widely held misconception of the final days of the Chinese Royal Court, the role which Tzu His played in it.  Many histories of China have relied on the writings of Backhouse as a historical source and reference, thus perpetuating the popular myth of the Dowager Empress as a ruthless leader of her people.  At times HTR is typically given to eloquent turns of phrase, making reading a little slow at times.  None the less, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a stirring read, and despite its age, should be viewed as a companion to the much more recent \\"Dragon Lady\\" by Sterling Seagrave to flesh out one of the main characters of early 20th century Peking. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Unfortunately his overly positive approach does not present an accurate view of the field. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis; to hear Rhine's account you'd think these were all proven. If a tested phenomenon has been reported positively twice, Rhine considers it verified, no matter how many negative studies have been done, no matter allegations of experimental weakness, data manipulation and subject and experimenter fraud.<br /><br />Not one of the phenomena Rhine discusses can be routinely verified under adequately controlled conditions to this day. If people could see hidden objects and influence events such as the roll of a die, Las Vegas would have been bankrupted long ago.<br /><br />Since Rhine's discussion of paranormal phenomena are so flawed, the later chapters on social, scientific and religious implications are worthless.<br /><br />If you are looking for Rhine's \\"Galileo wannabe\\" moment, it's on page 156 of the William Sloane version of the book.	2005-10-09

A revelation...	I can't say enough good things about this book...  I read it after doing a web search of various symptoms and realizing my best friend who I had recently started rooming with had BPD. Let me tell you, it was the epiphany to end all epiphanies - realizing that I was NOT imaging things, being overly sensitive, or going crazy and that there was an \\"answer\\".  This realization gave me a sense of peace I cannot begin to describe.  Waves of shock went through my body as I saw symptom after symptom listed; some of the case studies were almost verbatim accounts of the rage filled blow ups and bizarre behavior I experienced first hand.  The authors call this realization \\"the light bulb effect\\" (perfectly put, by the way). I was fortunate enough to be able to remove myself from the BPD environment shortly after realizing what was going on, so while I can't vouch for the usefullness of the tips the authors give on how to deal with/live with a BPD person, I nevertheless count this book among the most important I've read thus far in my life.  The authors break everything down in clear, concise, easy to understand terms and give very specific and realistic analogies and examples to illustrate their points.  \\"Gaslighting\\" was the term that spoke to me the most.  This is when the BPD's [inaccurate] reality is different from, if not the exact opposite of yours.  I'll give you my own horrific experience with this:  I asked my roommate a question, she guessed at the answer but didn't know for sure if she was correct.  So I emailed my mother the question and she verified my friend was right.  So I showed her the email from my mother, the whole point being \\"Look, you were right!\\"  Well somehow this triggered a 15 minute long screaming, yelling, belittling, venomous verbal tirade that ended with her screaming \\"And then you show me this letter from your mother to tell me I'm wrong!\\"  THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT I SAID!  I started yelling at her to look at the email to see that I was, as I said, showing her she was right and she refused to look at the paper, actually turned her head away so she wouldn't see the printed words.  For whatever reason, she NEEDED to feel I was trying to tell her she was wrong and therefore stupid.  This trait is summed up by the authors in one simple sentence: \\"Non BPDs base their feelings on the facts, while BPDs change the facts to fit their feelings\\".  It was worth the purchase price for this sentence alone!  If you suspect someone in your life has BPD, this is a must.  Even if you don't, it's still a fascinating read.  There is a place in heaven for these authors!!!	2005-10-08

Just a quick note to all the haters and doubters out there.  Don't judge before you have experienced.  When I first encountered Sylvia Browne in the late 1990's, I used to think exactly as some of the reviewers of her books and her detractors characterize her.  That is, as a useless and dangerous criminal charlatan.  But then, something amazing happened.  I got to actually be \\"read\\" by her at an event in Toronto at the Learning Annex.  In the span of a minute and a half, Sylvia (through spot-on and specific references to people I know or have known, experiences I have had or was in the midst of having at the time, etc.) proved to me that she was for real. <br /> <br />I am not talking about some John Roberts BS like, \\"I'm sensing someone by the name of G in the room.\\".  I'm talking specific names, dates, events, chronology, and the relation between them.  Then, after giving me a rundown of what was going on in my life at that time, she proceeded to tell me how everything was going to unfold in the next year.  Well, all I have to say is that she was right on the money on all counts.  Not only did what she said would happen happened, all of it occurred at exactly the order and time intervals she predicted.  I will not divulge the details because this had to do with private matters that, frankly, are nobody's business but my own (another thing, even though we were in a large hall with hundreds of people, Sylvia maintained professionalism by not embarrasing me with too private a reading).  Since then, I have had the priviledge of having 2 formal readings with her, each of which was just superb.   <br /> <br />There are those who say that she is not a serious scholar of the paranormal.  But, I ask you, how in the hell can anyone be a serious scholar of the paranormal?  By definition, the paranormal is fleeting, and subject to much interpretation from enumerable points of view.  Nothing can be isolated and verified.  None of it can be replicated.  Therefore, there is no scientific basis for inquiry, right?  What kind of sources can be sighted in such a course of study?  A book by someone who read a book by someone who read another book by someone who swears that a friend of a friend 30 years ago saw some freaky crap happening in the night's sky, huh?  Ridiculous. <br /> <br />So, if you're picking up this book and saying to yourself \\"Who does this person think they are?  They're going to tell me about life, about the paranormal, about my future?\\", just give it a try and see if you are not wholeheartedly convinced that Sylvia is the real thing.  You might just actually feel all of your skepticism just slipping away into the ether.	2005-10-08

From these studies the author developed unique insights. His perspective of the earth, time, and its place in space ... is a very fascinating reading experience. His hypothesis is based on connections he has made from ancient and modern astronomical and scientific discoveries. He noted one main distinguishing difference between ancient and modern man is the concept of time. Modern man is obsessed with a linear focus - seeming to view events and discoveries on the basis of evolution, going from the simpler to more complex level. Ancient cultures however, viewed time as cyclical, even the Old Testament speaks of a time and season for every purpose and event. The ancient Babylonians, the Egyptians who built the pyramids, the shamans of the Hopi Indians of North America, the Mayan Indians of Central America, and the oldest civilization in the world which existed in India - all had an obsession with time. They demonstrated this knowledge by tracking the stars in the heavens and leaving monuments which are often records of their discoveries. Noting the abundant scientific evidence for the cyclical nature of many biological, physiological, and chemical life processes ... the author noted that ancient people had recognized patterns and cycles of the stars and its causes. The author describes how modern scientists view the concept called \\"celestial motion of precession\\" and its causes. The author provides detailed explanations why his view supports what the ancient Arabic, Sumerian, Mithraic, and Vedic traditions hinted at ... that our sun is influenced by another star. This other star (or sun) could affect many aspects of life on earth through its orbital cycle, gravitational pull and magnetic energies. This other star could be the cause of the cyclical nature of many natural events from the ancient past, the modern present, and future life on earth.<br /><br />The author obviously loves his subject and does a phenomenal job of sharing his knowledge and deep insights. He has a wonderful grasp of the science of astronomy. He lucidly explains and describes difficult concepts and ideas on this subject. Each suspense filled chapter is an adventurous read which unfolds fascinating ancient scientific knowledge of astronomical observations comparing it to the modern scientific view. The author includes a very helpful glossary for complicated terms and unfamiliar concepts. He provides a wonderful bibliography referenced by footnotes in each chapter where supporting data and the ideas can be verified by any curious reader. There is a terrific appendix with eight sections which is an added bonus that includes otherwise difficult to obtain information. The author created the four tiered Galileo Awards each with a substantial monetary award attached, in order to challenge the scientific community to provide the scientific evidence required to prove once and for all ... the existence of the binary twin associated with our sun. I give 10 stars to this book as recommendation for anyone interested in ancient cultures, myths, and astronomy.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)ts from the ancient past, the modern present, and future life on earth.<br /><br />The author obviously loves his subject and does a phenomenal job of sharing his knowledge and deep insights.

It is noteworthy he shies away from including Judaism in his list of religions that are anathema.  This compromises his integrity in the name of political correctness.<br /> Nowhere does he account for the ultimate basis of morality and the legitimacy of judging one act as right and another as wrong.<br /> He attacks the design argument by a cursory assumption of the veracity of Darwinism.<br /> He ignores the fact of human sin and whether or not there is a solution for it and whether or not sin incurs judgment on the other side of the grave.<br /> He ignores the supernatural history and continuity of Christian revelation and its consummation in the Life, Death and Resurrection of Christ.<br /> He criticizes Christ's character on the basis of the latter's pronouncements on sin, death, judgment and hell.  If hell is real, Christ's adamant emotions on the subject are well warranted.  But, Russell simply presumes against these teachings.  He doesn't accomplish what he wishes by begging the question.  By His resurrection, Christ is in a better position to decide the question concerning the existence of hell.<br /> Unfortunately, great achievements in mathematical logic have proven, with Russell, that they are insufficient credentials for making a good theologian or a cogent apologist for the ungodly.<br /> Russell, like John Stuart Mill or Charles Darwin, possessed an impressive mind.  He was erudite in his professional career and a lucid and eloquent writer.  But he was stillborn in his criticism of Christianity.<br /> I think a pervasive Darwinist culture put the blinders on so that his horse could not take his carriage down the right path.  Had he been exposed to modern results of Creationist researchers, his Darwinism would have fallen apart and the rest of his criticisms with it.<br /> Fossilization has proven the catastrophic model of the biblical flood as against the uniformatarianism of Darwinism.  Unfossilized dinosaur bones, including their fresh blood, has refuted the speculations and circular reasoning of the great ages of the dinosaurs posited arbitrarily by evolutionists.  Paleontologist Mary Schweitzer's and others have verified this.  Folklore, linguistics and artwork across the globe testify to the flood, the coexistence of dinosaurs (aka dragons) with man and such biblical narrations as the tower of Babel.  Submerged civilizations such as off the coast of Cuba, Yamaguchi Japan, Lake Titicaca and so on confirms not only biblical accounts but a different geography and atmosphere of earth's past.<br /> Russell reckons the universe too unjust for God to exist.  But, he puts the cart before the horse.  It would be more unjust for there to be no God to punish the wicked who have perpetrated so much harm to other people.  And we know their number is plenty and their crimes horrific.  Even the notion of law has no meaning unless there is a lawgiver.  As a logician, familiar with the notions of sense and reference, Russell should know this .  The primitive Aristotelian logic of the Scholastics he criticizes didn't blind the scholastics to this fact, but Russell missed the point.<br /> The sophistries of the devil and human sin have proved more than a match for the intellectual acumen of Bertrand Russell.  Ironically, in his last days he embraced the Sermon on the Mount as a model of morality.	2005-10-07
