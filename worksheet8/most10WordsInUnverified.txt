If

people
who
just
post
partisan
attacks
or
commentaries
withouth
actually
mentioning
anything
relating
book
which
80
reviews
book
then
read
After
reading
several
Ted
Ralls
columns
seeing
him
tv
there
was
not
one
thing
he
said
had
agreed
However
after
reading
book
he
suprisingly
rational
some
issues
including
immigration
abortion
Overall
book
was
lot
more
interesting
thoughtprovoking
than
most
usual
liberal
tripe
people
like
Al
Franken
David
Corn
or
David
Brock
THe
main
reason
because
it
actually
talks
about
what
Rall
thinks
should
done
regardless
how
crazy
some
ideas
are
only
spends
1
chapter
complaining
about
Republicans
how
theyre
evil
etc
usual
best
selling
political
book
from
liberals
these
days
all
about
Bush
Republicans
lying
etc
Rall
has
finally
figured
out
people
are
sick
these
attack
books
might
rather
instead
hear
what
liberals
stand
So
here
goes
Ralls
writing
very
easy
follow
although
his
tone
bit
crude
times
only
problem
had
he
doesnt
use
footnotes
or
sources
text
All
sources
are
listed
topic
end
leaving
you
go
hunting
validity
any
claims
made
book
There
are
several
chapters
which
are
repeats
each
other
but
guess
some
people
never
get
tired
term
neofascists
Just
like
any
liberal
book
completely
unverified
conspiracy
theories
are
mentioned
Bush
had
his
underage
girlfriend
get
abortion
1971
when
it
was
still
illegal
Bush
officials
invaded
Afghanistan
because
oil
gas
pipeline
Al
Gore
actually
won
Florida
46000
votes
so
dont
fret
if
youre
koolaid
drinker
Overall
he
does
manage
stay
pretty
close
ideas
issues
instead
personal
attacks
though
Some
things
which
Rall
has
suggested
agreed
included
Education
cirriculum
should
nationalized
affirmative
action
indistinguishable
from
quotas
affirmative
action
should
eliminated
or
based
class
not
race
from
biological
standpoint
abortion
killing
unborn
baby
we
differ
here
think
killing
not
justifiable
whereas
Rall
believes
it
Americans
seeking
cast
votes
should
answer
few
simple
questions
US
should
admit
more
legal
fewer
illegal
immigrants
agree
totally
all
these
ideas
What
suprising
they
are
all
stark
contrast
basic
Democraticliberal
principles
Now
there
are
plenty
things
which
Rall
says
are
completely
crazy
He
course
wants
major
economic
changes
all
moving
us
more
towards
socialism
wealthy
individuals
businesses
should
taxed
nearly
death
Also
he
says
Judges
should
decide
punishments
instead
mandatory
sentencing
laws
whole
reason
which
was
take
out
subjectivity
sentences
between
judges
we
need
convince
other
countries
hate
us
not
hate
us
environment
most
important
priority
Democrats
need
completely
ruthless
shameless
fighting
Republicans
This
one
main
themes
book
which
think
Rall
completely
wrong
He
says
Republicans
win
because
they
are
underhanded
they
fight
so
much
harder
dishonestly
than
Democrats
believe
reason
people
arent
voting
Democrats
most
ideas
he
suggests
because
majority
people
country
dont
agree
them
esp
ones
mentioned
above
If
youre

This

attention
ironically
not

because
new

Anyway
spent

enthusiastically
beginning

was

praised

without
any

would
also
first
congratulate

However
terms

would
say

not

A

worked
experiments
probably

suffered
unverified
experiments
due

his

It
surprised
me

won

within

This
oversimplified

If

didnt

details

experiments
couldnt
replicated

officially
it
impossible
get

let
alone

One
key
components
book
about
research
ethics
We
have
heard
many
rumors
about
research
ethics
This
book
talked
about
similar
situation
occurred
Noble
Laurel
David
Baltimores
lab
which
postdoc
was
involved
some
manipulations
data
like
authors
way
presentation
hinted
but
never
gave
definite
answer
whether
postdoc
did
something
wrong
experiment
or
not
In
terms
science
ethics
would
like
recommend
people
reviewing
one
most
horrible
studies
modern
history
Tuskegee
Syphilis
Experiment
This
study
was
initiated
United
States
Public
Health
Service
together
Tuskegee
Institute
1932
study
recruited
399
black
men
diagnosed
syphilis
Macon
County
Alabama
determine
effects
untreated
syphilis
study
would
last
until
1970
way
after
discovery
penicillin
1943
which
most
effective
drug
treat
syphilis
Unfortunately
these
black
men
highest
education
7th
grade
were
only
treated
aspirin
iron
supplement
It
was
till
mass
media
caught
horror
halted
experiments
By
then
many
had
died
complications
syphilis
Although
book
spent
quite
some
length
talking
about
trust
responsibility
authorship
lab
rules
particular
peer
pressure
jealousy
advisor
seeking
tenure
system
gender
discrimination
author
barely
scratched
surface
publishing
process
grant
application
management
other
important
research
activities
It
possible
author
thought
his
intended
readers
are
most
likely
undergraduates
or
beginning
graduates
However
beginning
graduates
are
eager
know
how
these
research
activities
are
like
so
they
can
decide
whether
they
want
seek
academic
jobs
or
not
Most
time
advisors
are
reluctant
talk
about
these
issues
new
graduate
students
author
also
devoted
some
pages
sex
especially
teacherstudent
type
sex
am
not
sure
why
he
blended
sex
book
but
it
did
add
some
vintages
it
depicting
female
scholars
novel
too
optimistic
That
fresh
female
chemistry
PhD
can
get
assistant
professorship
Harvard
Cal
tech
Wisconsin
amazing
if
not
shocking
In
terms
writing
skills
author
seemed
have
adopted
film
making
style
However
sometimes
background
events
cut
into
flow
story
too
abruptlyFurthermore
author
lacked
ability
write
juicy
words
when
he
was
describing
romantic
events
His
view
sex
romance
was
also
old
fashioned
think
ending
worst
part
novel
As
we
all
know
academic
people
are
good
insinuating
things
A
famous
professor
will
never
write
blunt
insulting
letter
another
professor
guess
author
tried
give
solutions
all
problems
left
novel
instead
giving
some
hints
This
reflects
his
lack
confidence
his
readers
which
are
least
college
students
doubt
not
prepared
high
school
student
can
understand
many
concepts
discussed
his
book
In
summary
if
you
dont
know
much
about
scientists
book
will
give
you
good
kick
start
If
you
are
graduate
student
who
talk
your
advisors
very
often
book
may
too
simple
you
If
you
are
seasoned
researcher
it
probably
wiser
use
your
time
other
amusements
