Unlike

read

open

Even
more
than
having
personally
been
Mike
Warnke
fan
many
years
ago
had
noticed
my
own
his
stories
do
not
line
up
With
mind
sat
down
sketched
out
many
simple
facts
do
not
add
up
encourage
anyone
interest
Mike
Warnke
step
past
their
own
emotional
responses
actually
study
Mike
Warnkes
wordsbr
For
example
if
you
were
listen
all
Mike
Warnkes
concert
recordings
keep
journal
everything
he
claims
then
compare
notes
from
individual
recordings
Satan
Seller
you
will
quickly
realize
your
own
Mikes
portrayal
his
own
life
just
not
possible
His
story
his
own
life
changes
too
greatly
over
time
Additionally
timeline
events
Mike
describes
cannot
accomplished
calendar
Although
some
errors
can
attributed
passage
time
possibility
fact
or
two
can
misplaced
staggering
number
incongruities
occur
Mikes
own
words
are
just
too
many
shrugged
off
After
amassing
such
list
apparent
mistakes
your
own
have
suggested
sit
down
read
book
You
will
see
not
only
does
your
list
make
sense
Mikes
life
does
not
but
you
will
able
fill
many
causations
backgrounds
inconsistenciesbr
find
it
amusing
however
people
who
are
accusing
writers
book
dishonesty
are
also
stooping
namecalling
same
time
degrading
books
authors
promoters
namecallers
Thats
like
saying
Stop
calling
me
names
you
poohpooh
head
understand
there
are
great

Mikes
public

several
people
still
do
This
causes
emotional
reaction
truth
makes
it
almost
impossible
some
people
take
For
example
most
people
have
been
around
Internet
long
enough
point
have
seen
Urban
Legend
or
two
When
you
point
out
someone
has
forwarded
you
Urban
Legend
there
underlying
realization
sender
they
have
just
been
fooled
They
become
embarrassed
defensive
sometimes
deny
truth
trying
back
up
story
allegations
story
was
verified
other
sources
There
comes
time
when
you
have
put
aside
your
emotional
reaction
situation
just
analyze
factsbr
also
find
it
interesting
one
reviewers
seems
base
his
assertion
Mikes
innocence
personal
conversation
he
had
Mike
Although
am
not
100
sure
feel
most
people
would
easily

they

him
Thats

If
Mike
had
come
forth
openly

he
had

asked
forgiveness
from
those
he
had

outcast
then

such

But

it
frequently
hard

And
unless

suggests

not

realizing
my

had

Let
me
tell

it
was
epiphany
end
all

realizing
was
NOT

being

down

points
Gaslighting
was
term
spoke
me
most
This
when
BPDs
inaccurate
reality
different
from
if
not
exact
opposite
yours
Ill
give
you
my
own
horrific
experience
asked
my
roommate
question
she
guessed
answer
but
didnt
know
sure
if
she
was
correct
So
emailed
my
mother
question
she
verified
my
friend
was
right
So
showed
her
email
from
my
mother
whole
point
being
Look
you
were
right
Well
somehow
triggered
15
minute
long
screaming
yelling
belittling
venomous
verbal
tirade
ended
her
screaming
And
then
you
show
me
letter
from
your
mother
tell
me
Im
wrong
THE
EXACT
OPPOSITE
OF
WHAT
SAID
started
yelling
her
look
email
see
was
said
showing
her
she
was
right
she
refused
look
paper
actually
turned
her
head
away
so
she
wouldnt
see
printed
words
For
whatever
reason
she
NEEDED
feel
was
trying
tell
her
she
was
wrong
therefore
stupid
This
trait
summed
up
authors
one
simple
sentence
Non
BPDs
base
their
feelings
facts
while
BPDs
change
facts
fit
their
feelings
It
was
worth
purchase
price
sentence
alone
If
you
suspect
someone
your
life
has
BPD
must
Even
if
you
dont
its
still
fascinating

note
all

out

Dont
judge
before
you
have
experienced
When
first
encountered
Sylvia
Browne
late
1990s
used
think
exactly
some
reviewers
her
books
her
detractors
characterize
her
That
useless
dangerous
criminal
charlatan
But
then
something
amazing
happened
got
actually
read
her
event
Toronto
Learning
Annex
In
span
minute
half
Sylvia
through
spoton
specific
references
people
know
or
have
known
experiences
have
had
or
was
midst
having
time
etc
proved
me
she
was

am
not
talking

some
John
Roberts
BS
like
Im
sensing
someone
name
G
room
Im
talking
specific
names

chronology

between
them
Then
after
giving
me
rundown
what
was
going
my
life
time
she
proceeded
tell
me
how
everything
was
going
unfold
next
year
Well
all
have
say
she
was
right
money
all
counts
Not
only
did
what
she
said
would
happen
happened
all
it
occurred
exactly
order
time
intervals
she
predicted
will
not
divulge
details
because
had
do
private
matters
frankly
are
nobodys
business
but
my
own
another
thing
even
though
we
were
large
hall
hundreds
people
Sylvia
maintained
professionalism
not
embarrasing
me
too
private
reading
Since
then
have
had
priviledge
having
2
formal
readings
her
each
which
was
just
superb
There
are
those
who
say
she
not
serious
scholar
paranormal
But
ask
you
how
hell
can
anyone
serious
scholar
paranormal
By
definition
paranormal
fleeting
subject
much
interpretation
from
enumerable
points
view
Nothing
can
isolated
verified
None
it
can
replicated
Therefore
there
no

inquiry
right
What
kind

can
sighted

study
A

someone
who

someone

saying
yourself
Who
does
person
think
they
are
Theyre
going
tell
me
about
life
about

about
my
future
just
give
it
try
see
if
you
are
not
wholeheartedly
convinced
Sylvia
real

You
might
just
actually
feel

your
skepticism
