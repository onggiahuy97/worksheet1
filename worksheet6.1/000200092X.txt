Barbara McLintock chronicles the history of the Montreux Clinic from the point when its founder, Peggy Claude-Pierre, started helping her own daughters deal with their eating problems to the point when the clinic surrendered its license. The author never makes her topic too over-emotional or turns it into a clinical case. She clearly explains the struggles that sufferers of anorexia and their families went through before and during their stay at the Montreaux clinic. You feel a great deal of sympathy for the patients and their families. It would have been easy for McLintock to paint Peggy Claude-Pierre as a villian. However, McLintock remains objective and honest with her entire subject matter and isn't afraid of including views of people who support the clinic's actions. This is a definite read for anyone wishing to understand how something that sounded so good could go so wrong.	2003-01-02

It's too bad McLintock managed to get this published. <br />The author obviously has a personal vendetta.  Her inaccurate portrail of Peggy Claude-Pierre, David Harris and the Montreux Clinic is a disgrace!  <br />I personally know three women who received treatment at Montreux.  Each one credits Claude-Pierre's methods with saving their lives.  Her loving, supportive intensive treatment should be an inspiration.  To print such lies just continues to cause unneccessary suffering to those who will not have the benefit of legitimate help.  <br />Shame on McLintock!	2002-09-04

For anyone who is familiar with the Montreux clinic this book proves to be a very interesting read. As an anorexic I remember seeing Peggy-Claude Pierre, (Clinic's director), on various television programs.(Some of which included: dateline, 20/20, Oprah, Maury Povich, Good Morning America). She was said to be \\"an angel\\", trying to save children that were otherwise doomed to certain death. In 1997 struggling in the hospital I remember longing to be at her clinic. My doctor doubted that she was as great as she was made out to be, but I wrote it off as jealousy. Anyone who is familiar with eating disorders know that the causes are vast and often complex. <br /> This book tells about how she started off with very good intentions, but somehow became too money hungry along the way. She did not have the least amount of knowledge as to how to run a clinic of this nature, nor did she bother to provide adequate staff. The patients, weakened and vulnerable, were in so many ways as much victims to her, as they were to their eating disorders. <BR> <BR> This novel proves that there is no easy cure.	2002-07-30

The bulk of this title is truly outrageous filth designed to drum up readership.  The more sensational the better - who cares about the victims.  I have followed the sad story of Peggy Claude-Pierre's fight against an antiquated and unlawful medical system which puts its ego ahead of the true welfare of patients.  McLintock's book only serves to add to this burden.  McLintock is doing a fine job of grabbing her 15 minutes by riding Claude-Pierre's coat-tails.  This seems to be a common occurence in BC's medical system where Justice has yet to prevail.  Clearly, this title has no consideration for the truth and less consideration for the poor souls afflicted by anorexia.  Those poor young women who died did so because they were forced to leave the program prematurely.  And who was instrumental in that?  It doesn't seem to matter to McLintock.  I could go on, yet all I can say is that I whole-heartedly agree with the other reader from the USA, this book is a waste of paper.  Don't bother, unless you enjoy tabloid news.	2002-07-25

Sadly, the addage if it is too good to be true, it probably is applies.  The most compeling part of the book is not the high flying TV personalities like Barbara Walters, Maury and Operah but the heart wrenching stories of the young women who went for a $1000/day therapy at Claude-Pierre's Montreux Clinic. Particularly disturbing is Peggy Claude-Pierre's misdiagnosis and mistreatment of a three year old child.  This is a great book and deserves a read...  It is only fitting that the author dedicated the book to the young women who died of their eating desorders, despite be treated by a media \\"angel\\".	2002-06-22

McLintock tells it as it was.. Children being held against their will in a non-medical facility.  Non-profit Society funds being used to pay a private company owned by Peggy-Claude-Pierre and her husband David Harris.  <BR>Very sick children and young adults being cared for by other patients and recruited coffee shop staff from about town in Victoria British Columbia.  Secrecy and isolation.  This book should be a training manual for emerging countries setting up their human rights code. A very compelling book.  It displays Montreux and its owners as who they really are, a fiddle player and a retired waitress.. How they got their recognition and publicity to launch their international scam is cleanly laid out in this book.. I could not give it a higher recommendation.. Anyone who has thought of sending their loved one(s) to a private treatment facility of any type must read Anorexia's Fallen Angel...	2002-06-22
