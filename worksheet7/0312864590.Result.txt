I am shocked (SHOCKED, I tell ya!) at the complete lack of attention the reviewer below paid to things other than bosoms teadresses!  Where is the love for the deep, spooky characterization of the Forsaken?  All good stories need tension, usually between goodevil, but Jordan has brought us to a new level of literature by creating a multi-volume tale of good versus itself.  When has THAT been done before?  Who needs an evil mastermind when you can simply watch the main characters blunder about trying to interfere with each other's plans (when said plans exist)?  Let's look at the Forsaken, shall we?  We know there are a bunch of them. The men slightly outnumber the women, but that's OK.  An odd number is more interesting, right?  Each of these Forsaken has some part to play in creating problems in the world.  We know, for example, that a few of them deposed despotstemporarily took their places.  Then they got whacked, often through their own stupidity or because they suddenly forgot that they were magical superbeingslet someone zap them while they gaped helplessly.  One got eaten by a shadow-thingy, which was all around him but, apparently, he couldn't see.  Several of them were reincarnated, but given new namesbodies, so that it took a couple of paragraphs to figure out who they were. We know that they were reincarnated because the Dark One needed them for his plan to....well, we don't know what his plan is, but surely he has one!  And since this is a Wheel of Time novel, it MUST be a doozy.  Evenit's non-existent, it must rule!  Anyway, all the Forsaken have spooky names, which I've quickly forgotten.  And they all had tasks.  For example, Semirhage was supposed to disappear for the first 10 books, popping up about 2-3 times to torture someone for no reason other than she likes to.  Wooo!  Moghedian did her best to imitate Nynaeve, which led to a fight.  Later, she got sucked into a black ball, but we're not sure what happened to her because it's not important. Rahvin was all set for a magicalphysical encounter with Rand, which explains why Moiraine balefired him so easily.  Apparently, he forgot that magic can kill.  Sammael?  That's the guy that got shadow-et.  Lanfear fell into the evil elf-world, but came back bosomy-ier than ever.  She wants Rand, because she wanted Lews Therin, even though Rand isn't anything like Lews.  At all.  Which is, er, why she wants him?  Anyway, there's also Messana, who is in the tower plotting to....um, read or something.  Graendel got sucked into a black ball.  No, that was Moghedian.  Graendel is pretty much the same as Moghedian, but not currently black balled.  The music-playing bad-guy (Asmodean?) was whacked by another Forsaken.  He was the scariest, as he was so evil that he BECAME JEALOUS OF OTHER MUSICIANSturned to the dark side.  Seriously.  I'm not surehe used music as a weapon, but that's his background.  There were some others, but they died quicklystupidly, too.    With such terrifying bad-guys doing such terrifying things (reading! being gone! getting stuidly whacked! playing music!) you can see why this series is so tenseexciting!  I can't wait for #11, so that Jordan can cram about 600 unfinished plot lines into 600 pages (that's about a plot line per page)!  Woo hoo!  
If you want great fantasy as opposed to poor, read George RR Martin's series instead.  Martin's charactersplot are both interesting-something lacking in this overdrawn boring series.   If you enjoy reading pages of description irrelevant to the plot, you may enjoy this series. If suffering from sleep deprivation, read this series but keep a barf bag nearby.  Comparing this series to the classics demonstrates a unfamiliarity with the classicsis an insult to the classics.
This is the worst entry yet in a series that is rapidly becoming the biggest joke of the sci-fi/fantasy world.  I'm writing this as a review.  The purpose of a review is to alert potential readersa book is horrible or to say that it's worth buying.    Having reminded some of the reviewers below what a review is, I'll continue with some specifics to back up my opinion.  This book does NOT advance plot, tie up the millions of loose (or pointless) former plot threadlings, or make me want to read more.  There are hundreds of pages of people doing very little more than they were in the previous book.  Sure, MatTuon move on a little, but not much.  Perrin moves closer to Faile, but not much.  Elayne makes a little progress on her power-bid, but not much.  It's frustrating to read something that 1)does not develop the characters--these characters are still one-dimensionaldon't grow 2)does not make significant advances in the plot--don't tell me the illogicaltotally stupid/out-of-character action Egwene takes in the last 2 pages is well done 3)does not let us in on any of the millenia-long plottingplanning of the Forsaken--what are these people doing to become top dog? what are their goals/schemes? we never really know. 4)leaves us hanging about the ONLY major plot advance Jordan's made in 4 books/8 years: cleansing of saidin.  I mean, seriously.  5)does not \\"deepen\\" the story--it's more like a collection of poorly written short-stories about the \\"other\\" characters.  If you think about it, this book is really NOT about the WoT story, but is the kind of thing fan-fic forums are for.  Except that the fans write better fiction.  See, for example, the many 1-star reviews below.  Finally, to argue that those who post negative reviews are \\"unworthy\\" or \\"unintelligent\\" or should \\"shut up\\" have completely missed the point of a reviewalso reveal their inability to write a good review.  If you truly think this is greatwriting, be prepared to back it up with insightexamples, not \\"I liked it\\" or insults.  For example,you think the relationships between the men/women--about 80% of this book--are worth reading, tell us why.  I'd love to see some super-fan defend the horrible writing that Jordan thinks of as romance. Please tell us why it makes sense for Lan to love Nynaeve. Or what it is about Min/Elayne/Aviendha that Rand likes? Or what they see in him?  Go ahead. Write an actual review. This stuff is as revealing, deep,surprising as a Scooby Doo episode--the ones with Scrappy Doo.
This book was, without a doubt, the best in the series so far. My advice to anyone who doesn't like the series is to stop readingmake everyone happy. It would seem that many of the current generation of readers lack the attention span to actually enjoy anything longer than 10-15 pages. This is very sad because they are missing out on a great many things simply because of their lack of patience. Robert Jordan is telling his story in the way that he chooses. Enjoy it while you can because he will probably move on to a different story when this one is doneleave the World of the Wheel behind forever.
I wouldn't buy this book evenRobert Jordan agreed to match 100% of the sales profitsdonate the whole lot to the relief efforts in New Orleans.  It's so bad I can't see spending anything on it, eventhe proceeds went to charity.  In this latest installment of \\"Slowly Boring Readers to Death\\" Jordan manages to talk about nothing for an even longer period of time than before.  I hate Mat.  I hate Tuon.  I hate their supposed romance, which, like all WoT romances, is built on mutual hatredantagonism.  Apparently, the key to love in Rand-land is to annoy the heck out of someone until they realize that it must be love.  See for example Nynaeve's relationship with Lan, Szechuan Sianche's love with crusty-old-general-guy, Rand's relationship with all women, etc., etc., etc.  It's scary to think that Cadsuane's vile behavior might turn into a love affair with Rand.  That's RJ's pattern of character development, anyway.    Cadsuane: (Smacks Rand) Rand: What did you do that for? Cadsuane: (Smacks Rand again) Because I have to teach you! Rand: Huh? Cadsuane: (Smack!) This is for your own good! Rand: Duh?  Cadsuane: You MUST learn what I have to teach you before you face the Dark One! (Smacks him again) Rand: O.K.! Just stop hitting me!  What is it you're going to teach me? Cadsuane: (Smacks him again) A real lord won't just give up when someone starts smacking him!  And I have no clue what I'm supposed to teach you (Smack!) because Jordan has no clue!  But in the meantime I'll smack you around because that is how people realistically behave! (Smack) Rand: (choosing not to simply put a barrier of air between his cheeksCadsuane's hand) Huh? Duh!  In the next scene, RandCadsuane are in bed with Rand's three wiveslots of random Aiel women, all of whom sniff at each othersay, \\"I told you so!\\" We are all left wondering what the meaning of this might be.  Whenreaders ask RJ what the point of all that was he sniffssays, \\"I learned to read with the INCIDENTAL aid of my brother! I don't need to explain!  I graduated from the Citadel! I have a bearda cane!\\"
\\"What are we doing here ?\\" asks Randtugs viciously Nynaeve's braid. \\"You men can be such woolheads !\\" growls Elaynetugs something on Rand that she should not have. \\"Would you please stop tugging THAT Elayne ? You should know very well that a pregnant woman should be sipping honeyed tea in those exceptional Sea folk porcelaine cups instead. Not too much honey though, mark my words.\\"  As an afterthought he adds :\\"And you Min are wearing pale green silk dress slashed with silver stripes that clings to your bodydisplays too much bosom. How am I to save the worldyou keep running around displaying this much bosom ? And don't even begin to think of crossing your arms below your breasts , it would only make the matter worseI may say so.\\"  A booming crash erupts behind the door. \\"Ah don't pay attention, it is only Perrin throwing again his axe away. Let us hope there are not too many casualties. You know how much he hates killing women.\\" comments Randsprawls on the throne seemingly finding that a good tug is better than a bad book. Perrin storms in the room dragging Faile behind him by her hair. A very bewildered Faile is sliding on the marble floor , feebly kicking.  Perrin sighs :\\"I will never understand women. RandMat do. I wish I'd be like them. For they understand women. Understand as opposed to not understand. You see it's not that I wouldn't enjoy some tugging like everybody else. So here I grasp Faile...\\" He stops ashe had hit an invisible wall.  Anilin, Brumbudin, Creepilin, Dumbalin, Endomorphin ... stand across the room violently smoothing their dresses, tugging shawls, embroidering slippersscowling in his general direction. There is also a small very ugly Aes Sedai in stout woolens who can't smooth anything but looks like actually winking suggestively at him.  Perrin's bulging muscles the size of a tree trunk saghis knees go weak. All he manages is a trembling squeak \\"Please not the scowls. And my God there is one winking at me !\\" Rand jumps up, kicks Faile under the throneputs his arms around Perrin's shoulders.  \\"Hi Perrin ! I remeber now ! You know that I met this funny Shaitan something guy , do you ? He's running a private club called Shayol. Yes a bit dark place but you have never tasted the quality of the booze he serves. No bloody spiced wine , no sir . Godly stuff. Hahaha , godly indeed !\\"  Entering the corridor Rand waves negligently his handa burst of balefire erases from existence a room full of sniffing, glaringotherwise things tugging creatures. The small ugly furiously winking Aes Sedai lingers a little but finishes by disappearing too.  Only the sound of gradually diminishing Rand's voice echoes in the empty hall as he goes away with Perrin : \\"...then Rahvin puts some sneezing powder in Sammael's cigar. You should have seen Sammael's face when he spilled the drink all over him. Even Shaitan was like ROFL ! Yeah then LanfearGraendal joined us, boy , did they teach us things you'd never dream of .\\"  \\"And Perrin, you won't believe me. Not a single frigging tug during the whole evening ...\\"
Hundreds of pages of description of teas, dressesmannerisms. How does that advance the plot?  We do not need action to advance the story, we need real plot development. There is no excuse for this book to exist, other then to fatten Jordans bank account.  If it were only this one book, that could be overlooked. But each book since FoH has become progressively worse, lessless happening in each one.  We know Nynaeve is cluelesslikes to tuh her braid when she is angry(basically 24-7), we don't need to be reminded of it every page.  We know Perrin is upset about Faile(nothing, I mean nothing is more important, really, nothing...), but yet does nothing about it.  We know that Rand is tiredstretched thin, but does nothing. The one event eagerly waited for turned into nothing(Rand meeting Logain). We know that Rand does not trust Taim, yet he never checks up on him or the black tower, even after being attacked by Ashaman.  We know Aes Sedai like to hold themselves out as a mysteriouspowerful group of women. We know,are reminded on nearly every page, that what they really are, are cowardly, ignorant fools.  We know that Elayne is still pregnant, can't get the lion throne, even though she controls the palacearmies. She has yet to figure out, that she is not claiming the Lion throne by right, but because Rand secured it for her,is so incompetent she still can't get it. If not for Rand, Rahvin would control Andor, so her belief that she has some right to claim it is nonsense.  The only thing that was resolved in this book, was Egwene is a fool. But of course, we knew that already. The many minor storylines about people we don't really knowdon't care about at all, were not resolved, they were muddiedadded on to.  Jordan has long forgotten how to write a good story. He let it get away from him,only the most diehard(and blind) fan has stayed. The only way he could possibly finish this convoluted story in 2 books is by one of two things:  Each book will be at least 2000 pages long, which will never happen. Books 6-10 could have easily been 2 fantastic novels, but that would impact his bank account.  All the storylines will be closed off too quickly for it too really make sense. Jordan claims it will go to 12 books but look what need to be resolved:  1. The seanchan must fall under Rand 2. Mat needs to regain his armymarry Tuon,possibly take over the seanchan army 3. Rand needs to take over the blacktowersomewhat control his ashaman opponents 4. Perrin needs to free Failecompletely take care of the Shaido 5. Masemahis followers need to be taken care of. 6. Elayne needs to gain the throne 7. Egwene needs to escapetake control of the tower 8. The borderland armies needs to findfollow rand 9. The annoying Cadsuane needs to teach Randthe Ashaman something;probably how to be annoying. 10. The rest of the nations need to follow Rand. 11. Elayne needs to figure outstop her captian of the guards 12. The forsaken need to be handle, for real, this time. 13. Huge armies needs to be amassedmoved toward the blight 14. Whether Moraine is dead or not, she needs to show up again. My money is on her being bound to the horn now, but maybe she survived the fight against Lanfearwill find her way out. Perhaps, with the aid of Egwene. 15. Padan Fain needs to be destroyed. 16. The TairenCarhienan rebels need to be pacified,Carolinewhats his face need to be marriedgain the throne of a country. 17. Rand, Elayne, MinAvendeha need to get hitched 18. People, especially Aes Sedia need accept Ashaman as not tainted anymore 19. The whitecloaks need to be somehow destroyed or brought in line with Rand. Maybe Galad will take over the whitecloaks. 20. All the darkfriends need to be handled in some way, especially Carridin. 21. Lots of other minor storylines, like the fate of Liandrin need to be resolved. 22. The darkfriends, shadowspawn, dreadlords, forsaken need to be destroyed in a final battlethe dark one destroyed or locked back up. 23. Rand needs to die.  Phew! That is a lot of storyline to wrap upI bet I missed a few. CoT did nothing to move any of these along. So, supposedly, the next two books needs to do it.   The biggest problem with this series is the readers. How many people here admit the series is getting worseworse, yet feel like they can't leave it because they wasted all that time getting to this point. What sense is that? At the very least, wait until the series is finished,then read the paperback. Falling into the trap of reading it, to read it, rewards Jordan for his crappy writingencourages more of it. STOP THE MADNESS!
This is the kind of book that will drive people to want to write their own fantasy stories. Not out of a desire to emulate Jordan, of course, but out of the conviction that arises that good literature must be written in order to make up for Jordan's egregious failures.  It is not that this book is somehow by itself a series killer; it's that the series has been in suspended animation since a few books agoit took \\"Crossroads,\\" essentially several hundred pages of pointless filler - the stuff that editors usually delete before sending books on to the printers, to make even the die-hard fans die.   Hard.  And books that are comprised of nothing more than several hundred pages of pointless filler generally enjoy these two consequences of existing:   [1] Nobody - even generous fans - will remember what they've read two days after reading it, which means that . . .  [2] Whatever portion of the brain the reader has set aside for ruminating about the Wheel of Time will be turned towards thinking about how, you know, gosh - every single one of Jordan's characters are really, really annoying, and, gosh again - they've been doingsaying the same exact thingsnot getting even the tiniest bit wiser or smarter ever since the series began. Except for Rand - the supposed protagonist - but he's as crazy as an outhouse ratpretty much all-powerful so it's kind of hard to, you know, sympathize with the guy.  And it just gets worse from there as it becomes clearer that Jordan's ability to write any kind of coherent story utterly collapsed under the weight of his need to give his RPG contingent a really bitchin'totally detailed campaign setting. I mean, good Lord - how many pages about frickin' teadresses does ANY high-fantasy/obliquely-sci-fi adventure need?   And that d**n Nyaeve! If ever a character was created that needed to be slapped around by Captain Kirk on an off-shipbender, it's her!  And furthermore . . !  . . . (ahem).  See what I mean?  Do yourself - your blood pressure, to be specific - a favordiscontinue the reading of this series. Just grab the booksthrow them - without ceremony - into the nearest trash receptacle.   Then go find a used copy of Jack Vance's \\"Lyonesse\\"read that wonderful little gem instead. Read the other two books in that series, too,you can find them. I'll say this about Vance: wonderful writer,the man knew how to end a story.  Did you throw those Wheel of Time books away yet? I thought so - the smile on your face gives you away.
I bought this book in June 2002,have only now (June 2006) after several attempts struggled through the 94-page **introduction** (which recaps nothing, introduces nothing,seems to have no reason for existence) intothrough the body of the book.   At one point I considered prefacing this review with a 'spoiler warning'providing a 700-word summary of the 700-page opus. But it turns out to be unnecessary, as I can provide a 3-word summary that says it all while revealing nothing -- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS in the course of these 700 pages. The effective state of every plot element, every subplot,every major character is EXACTLY THE SAME at the end of the opus as it was at the beginning -- save one, true, but for these purposes we can disregard events that happen in the last 5 pages...  Even when Rand succeeds in finally cleansing the taint from saidin (no spoiler there; it has appeared on dust jackets), the action happens offstage,the impact of the long-awaited event on the actioncharacters is -- guess what -- Rand is a bit peaked. Otherwise, NADA!  I gave the book two stars rather than one solely because the narrative was not as cloyingly annoying as the last few volumes have been. Mr. Jordan seems to have serious problems with the viewpoint of his female viewpoint characters; more than somewhat of a problem because they provide the viewpoint for the bulk of his story.   Because the narrative was not as painful to read as the last few volumes have been,out of deference to the more than 16 years of my life I have spent reading this once-masterful series, I will try one more time,buy volume 11 when it is released. But volume 11 will be the last unless Mr.Jordan has finally delivered at least some token plot or character development to his long-suffering readers.
...that I love to read.  I'm hooked on fantasy,Robert Jordan was the one that got me hooked.  I devoured the first nine books in three months,by the ending of book nine(which I loved...the ending, that is) I was so excited for CoT.  I bought the hardcover as soon as it came out, not wanting to wait...yea, never doing that again.    I got to the start of Egweene's partstopped.  I could not stand it anymore...almost the whole book takes place during the chapter of the last book!!!  Like, what the heck??  Trust me, you'll not miss anything by not reading the book...I couldn't even remember who have the characters were by the time I started reading it anyway.  So take it from me, I'll read book 11...but I'm for sure waiting until it comes out in soft cover...I could of bought something MUCH better with that 45 bucks.
