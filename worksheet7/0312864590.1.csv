0312864590	I am shocked (SHOCKED, I tell ya!) at the complete lack of attention the reviewer below paid to things other than bosoms tea and dresses!  Where is the love for the deep, spooky characterization of the Forsaken?  All good stories need tension, usually between good and evil, but Jordan has brought us to a new level of literature by creating a multi-volume tale of good versus itself.  When has THAT been done before?  Who needs an evil mastermind when you can simply watch the main characters blunder about trying to interfere with each other's plans (when said plans exist)? <br /> <br />Let's look at the Forsaken, shall we?  We know there are a bunch of them. The men slightly outnumber the women, but that's OK.  An odd number is more interesting, right?  Each of these Forsaken has some part to play in creating problems in the world.  We know, for example, that a few of them deposed despots and temporarily took their places.  Then they got whacked, often through their own stupidity or because they suddenly forgot that they were magical superbeings and let someone zap them while they gaped helplessly.  One got eaten by a shadow-thingy, which was all around him but, apparently, he couldn't see.  Several of them were reincarnated, but given new names and bodies, so that it took a couple of paragraphs to figure out who they were. We know that they were reincarnated because the Dark One needed them for his plan to....well, we don't know what his plan is, but surely he has one!  And since this is a Wheel of Time novel, it MUST be a doozy.  Even if it's non-existent, it must rule!  Anyway, all the Forsaken have spooky names, which I've quickly forgotten.  And they all had tasks.  For example, Semirhage was supposed to disappear for the first 10 books, popping up about 2-3 times to torture someone for no reason other than she likes to.  Wooo!  Moghedian did her best to imitate Nynaeve, which led to a fight.  Later, she got sucked into a black ball, but we're not sure what happened to her because it's not important. Rahvin was all set for a magical and physical encounter with Rand, which explains why Moiraine balefired him so easily.  Apparently, he forgot that magic can kill.  Sammael?  That's the guy that got shadow-et.  Lanfear fell into the evil elf-world, but came back bosomy-ier than ever.  She wants Rand, because she wanted Lews Therin, even though Rand isn't anything like Lews.  At all.  Which is, er, why she wants him?  Anyway, there's also Messana, who is in the tower plotting to....um, read or something.  Graendel got sucked into a black ball.  No, that was Moghedian.  Graendel is pretty much the same as Moghedian, but not currently black balled.  The music-playing bad-guy (Asmodean?) was whacked by another Forsaken.  He was the scariest, as he was so evil that he BECAME JEALOUS OF OTHER MUSICIANS and turned to the dark side.  Seriously.  I'm not sure if he used music as a weapon, but that's his background.  There were some others, but they died quickly and stupidly, too.   <br /> <br />With such terrifying bad-guys doing such terrifying things (reading! being gone! getting stuidly whacked! playing music!) you can see why this series is so tense and exciting!  I can't wait for #11, so that Jordan can cram about 600 unfinished plot lines into 600 pages (that's about a plot line per page)!  Woo hoo! <br /> <br />
